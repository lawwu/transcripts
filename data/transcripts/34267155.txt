[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.800]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.600]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.440]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.720]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.320]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.260]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.680]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.640]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.360]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.360]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.040]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.600]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.600]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.960]   So, go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.320]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000]   Well, listeners, the holiday season is upon us,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.440]   and "Everyday Educator," as you know,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   takes its holidays very seriously.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   So today, in this first podcast of the Advent season,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.360]   we are going to be talking about a great book
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   and a great movie now, "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever."
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.240]   I know that probably you and your family
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.200]   are getting ready to celebrate,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.440]   and you are probably doing all kinds of traditional things,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   like baking cookies and decorating the Christmas tree,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.960]   and maybe you and your family
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.920]   are even involved in a Christmas pageant.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.520]   So, I suspect you've already heard
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.160]   that there's a new movie out,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever" has become a movie,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.920]   and lots of you may have already seen it,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.440]   or maybe you're kinda waiting on some reviews,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.280]   wondering if it's worth checking out or not.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.560]   So, this podcast is all about
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.600]   "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,"
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.000]   and I've got some friends
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080]   who are gonna give you some feedback.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   All right, welcome, my friends and fellow pageant lovers.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.480]   They are, people are eager to hear
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000]   what you guys have to say about the movie,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.520]   because some of us, I have to admit,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   I'm one of 'em, have not seen it yet, okay?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600]   So, so, me and all my listeners
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.400]   are eager to hear what you have to say.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.360]   Now, listeners, I have to tell you,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.280]   I had to cap the guest attendance on this podcast,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.320]   because when I went fishing among my buddies,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.200]   there were so many people who wanted to weigh in
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.720]   and share their reviews.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.080]   So, you're just gonna get my friend Babs,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.760]   Babs Harrell, say hello.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.600]   - Hello.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.840]   - And my friend Jamie Hayes.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   - Hello.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.920]   - And Deb Switzer.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.000]   - Hello.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.880]   - And Jennifer Hester.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.720]   - Hi.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   - Okay, so all these gals are gonna help us delve into
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.000]   what's so great about this story,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   and why was this movie worth their time?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   I have to say this, in the spirit of Christmas,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.760]   I'm giving you a spoiler alert.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.000]   We are gonna share details.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.560]   So, if you don't know this story,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.920]   and you hate to have spoilers to your story,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.880]   then pause the podcast, go read the book really quick,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.800]   and then come back and finish listening to the podcast.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.720]   I will tell you, most of you could probably read the book
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.200]   by Barbara Robinson, "The Best Christmas Paget Ever."
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.320]   You could probably read it in one sitting.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.920]   It is delightful.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.040]   It is not complicated reading.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   It is a great read aloud for your kids.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.080]   So, that's another suggestion for you.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.800]   All right, guys, let's just jump in.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.400]   All right, Deb, I want you to give us
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.160]   a rundown on the storyline.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.200]   You don't have to go into tons of specifics,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   but a rundown on the storyline.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.240]   What is this about?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.800]   - Such a great, funny story.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   I just laugh aloud every time I've read it.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.320]   The best way to sum it up is the first sentence of the book,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   which is, "The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.120]   "in the history of the world."
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.480]   (Deb laughs)
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.280]   It's basically about these six siblings, the Herdmans,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.040]   who are the bullies of this charming little neighborhood,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.720]   and we have the story of how they get involved in church.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.360]   So, they bully, and they smoke cigars,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.680]   and they do all these weird things.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.520]   They cause all kinds of destruction,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.320]   and they never go to church.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.160]   And through a series of events,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.600]   they end up wanting to be part
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.800]   of the Christmas pageant in the town,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.880]   and they force their way in,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.080]   and they come to the Christmas story
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.040]   with a whole different perspective,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.000]   and you kind of wonder what's gonna happen.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   But all the community ends up learning more
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.920]   about the whole Christmas story
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.320]   as they get involved with these kids
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   as they walk through the pageant together.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.480]   And it's really delightful.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.640]   The way that it ends is just so sweet.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   But you see lots of interactions between the kids,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.320]   and all the different things
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   that we kind of see in ourselves comes out
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.320]   as they go through that pageant together.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   - Yeah, so the premise of the story is very simple.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   I mean, it's Christmastime in a small town and at a church,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.320]   and so there's obviously gonna be a Christmas pageant.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.480]   Yeah, and so the whole story is about, like Deb said,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.080]   how these quote-unquote worst kids in the world
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   infiltrate the pageant and take it somewhere
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.400]   it has never been before.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.800]   Now, Jamie, there's more than just the herdmans,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.600]   the bad little guys, the bad kids.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.280]   There's more than just the herdmans in the story.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.160]   Tell us a little bit about other characters,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.920]   and even more about the herdmans if you want to.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.800]   - Yeah, so the herdmans are a group of siblings.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   I think there's five of them.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.000]   And like Deb said, they are known as being bullies.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They don't tend to have any parents or parental oversight.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   And then the main crux of it all, I think,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.800]   is just that the fact that they don't know
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.520]   the story of Christ's birth,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   which is what the whole book is about.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.240]   And then, of course, you have to have the good people,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.520]   quote-unquote, which would be the local church body
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.720]   who are very prideful of their pageant
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.240]   that they do every year.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   And they have very high standards.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.760]   In fact, this is a very important year.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.920]   It's the 75th anniversary of the pageant.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   Crews, news crews are coming to videotape it all.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.840]   And so there's a lot riding on the pageant this year.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.240]   And then there's this family in the church, the Bradleys,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.280]   who's a mom, Grace, dad, Bob,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   and then their two children, Beth and Charlie.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   And they become the people who interact the most,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.880]   it seems, with the herdmans.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.000]   They also seem to be mediators almost
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.360]   between the church and the herdmans throughout.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   And the mom ends up having to take on running the pageant.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.200]   And she does it differently
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.560]   than anybody else wants her to do it.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.240]   And so that causes a lot of problems
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.760]   for those that have a lot of pride in this pageant.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   - And a lot of tradition, I bet, yeah.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.200]   - Yes.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   - Don't mess with tradition.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.000]   The same people, right, always do the same parts.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.560]   And that didn't quite work out with bullies in the midst.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   And then the kids, I just think that they started out
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.760]   viewing the herdmans, of course, like everybody else,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.000]   the bullies. - Sure.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.240]   - And then I think as Beth and Charlie
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.640]   watched their parents interact with the herdmans,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   they grew a lot of just going from seeing them one way,
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:59.080]   but watching their parents ask questions
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.880]   or interact with the herdmans and realizing
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.040]   that there's always more than one side of the story.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.960]   - Oh, wow.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.760]   - And it's great to ask questions.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   I also love the fact that Beth and Charlie come across
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.680]   in the movie as very real live examples
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   of children their age.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.720]   - Okay.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.080]   - And little things that that age child
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.720]   would be going through and the thought processes
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.000]   that that age child would have.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   I felt they portrayed that really well.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.280]   - Oh, that's so good that it's realistic.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.560]   You know, you always think that,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.720]   are they gonna portray it in a way
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.640]   that I could recognize my kids
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.040]   or that my kids could recognize themselves?
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.160]   And I know one of the things that I loved about the book
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   was that the author, Barbara Robinson,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.880]   seemed to really get kids.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.920]   'Cause like in the dialogue of the kids
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.520]   and in their thoughts, like this is really how kids think
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.360]   and this is how they would really react.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.720]   These are the things that kids are afraid of.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.760]   These are the things that are boring to kids
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.600]   or the things that they dread
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.320]   or the things that they wonder about.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.440]   So I'm glad that the movie makes the kids real.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.680]   I think that tends to draw audiences into the story
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.440]   if they can relate to it.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.120]   But now the Herdmans,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.800]   they sound like a bunch of pieces of work.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.680]   They sound like some wild kids
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.040]   who maybe have a lot of rough edges.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.160]   I know at least in the book,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   it comes across as they are utterly unfamiliar
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.200]   with spiritual things, especially with churchiness.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.280]   Like they don't know how you're supposed to conduct
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.880]   yourselves at Sunday school or in the sanctuary
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.080]   or when you're reading a Bible verse.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.680]   And they tend to ask some kind of rude questions,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.040]   what might be viewed as rude questions.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.640]   Jennifer, did you know any kids like the Herdmans
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   when you were growing up?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.120]   - I mean, didn't we all?
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.640]   (all laughing)
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.560]   I mean, I think everybody has experienced
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.080]   or witnessed some form of bullying
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   or the outside kids who didn't belong or whatever.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.680]   So I think that we can all relate to knowing somebody
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.720]   or witnessing somebody similar.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.040]   Yeah, there's always the bullies in school.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.960]   And what I thought was really interesting
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.200]   and I had pointed out after watching the movie,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.680]   'cause some of my kids have read the book and some haven't,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.440]   was, were they really that terrible?
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.000]   Like once, spoiler alert.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.120]   Once the fire scene happened and they realized
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   that it wasn't actually the Herdmans that started the fire,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.600]   it made me question some of the other things
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.920]   that they had been accused of.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.720]   Was it assumed that they had done these things
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.640]   and maybe the kids just played into
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.440]   what people believed about them?
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.080]   - Aha.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.400]   - And so it just sparked a really great conversation
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.080]   with my own family on,
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.560]   do we fall into what other people believe
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.120]   because it's just easier than fighting it?
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   Or do we have a perceived reality of other people,
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.760]   even the bully, right?
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   Like there's a reason behind the behavior most of the time.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.200]   And so it was just a really great moment to pause
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.960]   and talk about who do we know like this
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.840]   and what, you know, what do we really know about them?
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.200]   Is there something that we're missing?
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.280]   Is there a missing piece?
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.240]   - Is there a reason that they're acting that way
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.080]   or are they really acting that way?
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   Or do we, are we making it worse
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.680]   by the way we think about it?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   - My mom was quick to tell me that they did in fact
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   do some of the things that they were accused of.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.040]   (laughs)
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.880]   - That is so funny.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.960]   That's really good.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.280]   And that's a really good talking point
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.040]   to have with your kids.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.720]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.760]   So let me ask you this Babs,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.000]   were you in Christmas pageants when you were a kid?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.800]   - Absolutely.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.400]   Weren't we all made to be in Christmas pageants
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.240]   just like the kids in the play?
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.880]   - That's what I was getting ready to say.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.000]   Were you made to be in it?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.680]   I can remember when my kids were little,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.480]   I remember being in pageants
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.200]   and I remember my kids being in pageants
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.320]   and if they wanted a different part,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.200]   no, these are all the parts we have.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   And the little girls in the primary Sunday school class
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.800]   are always the angels and the big,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.720]   it really did seem like there were roles
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   that you just got pushed into.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.200]   What was your part?
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.680]   Do you remember what was your part some year
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.600]   or all the years?
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.680]   - So we never did the same one every year.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.440]   We always had a new play.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   And we always had different people who were directing.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.520]   We didn't always have the same person who directed.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.680]   Well, I mean, there were a lot of adults,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.800]   like as a group, that kind of did it together.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.280]   But, so I've been an angel.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.520]   I know it's hard to believe that,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.880]   but I have been an angel.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.120]   I have been an animal in the stable.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.760]   - Oh yeah.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.720]   - And I remember just from reading the book
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   and then watching the movie,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.880]   we did this play at our church.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.240]   - Oh wow, cool.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.920]   - I got to play, I think her name's Beth.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.320]   She was the mom that was in charge of the play.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.920]   And I think I was in middle school at that point,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.800]   but I got to play her.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.040]   And so that was a really great memory
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.240]   to go back and watch it
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.120]   and just to kind of relive
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.240]   what we were doing at our church.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.720]   And I even asked some people from our church,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.480]   do you guys have any pictures of us doing this?
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.440]   I just want to relive,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.080]   you know, I want to see the pictures and relive,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.360]   but so far nobody has found anything, so.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.800]   - In a minute, I want you to talk maybe about
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.560]   what did you understand about,
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.480]   you're playing the part of that mom
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.840]   who had to take on running the pageant
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.680]   and answering all those questions about,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   well, why are you not doing it the way we always did?
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.000]   Well, what are you going to do about this?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.360]   And, you know, did you get that?
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.080]   So hold on to that though,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.720]   because I know that I want to talk about
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.520]   kids playing the same roles.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.120]   And I know a lot of, my husband's a pastor.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.240]   And so we have served lots of little churches
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.520]   where the Christmas pageant
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.080]   is just what this little Sunday school kids do.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.160]   They reenact the Christmas story every year.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.840]   And so there were always the kids who were the angels
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.400]   because they could sing pretty.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.640]   And then there was always the kids who were the shepherds
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.000]   'cause they didn't have any lines
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.720]   and they didn't want any lines.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   And so sometimes you end up with the same part every year.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:17.400]   Deb, what happens if the same kids
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.160]   do the same roles every year?
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.800]   What do you think might happen for those kids
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.360]   or even just for the tradition of the church?
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.920]   - Yeah, I think it's fascinating.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.200]   You know, I've directed Christmas pageants too in our church
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.520]   and, you know, there are gonna be the ones
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.720]   who never want to speak
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.880]   and the ones who want to just be in the background.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.680]   And I think one of the jobs of even the director
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.000]   is to keep it fresh.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.080]   And I think that that's one of the messages of this book
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.480]   is how do we get out of the rut of the Christmas story
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.200]   being so familiar to us
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   that it's become just these lines to this whole town
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   as they're sitting in there
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.600]   and the kids aren't connecting with the lines anymore
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   because it just all sounds the same.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.320]   They said, "I could read it backward and forward."
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.080]   And they don't have a fresh understanding of the nativity
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.200]   and what it means.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   And I think that that's the beauty
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.960]   of being able to reenact the Christmas story
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.480]   and the way that the book and the movie present it
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.160]   is that we have the joy
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.480]   of being able to come at it fresh every year,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.640]   that it took the herdmans
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.920]   to be able to knock them out of their tradition, maybe,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.560]   but then it was just this beautiful, fresh understanding
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   of who Jesus is and what it meant that he came to Mary
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.960]   and what it meant that he came to the world.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.440]   And if we can take something like this story
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.480]   and be able to make it fresh in all of our lives,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.560]   the way that the herdmans did in a very funny way,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.120]   but keeping it fresh is one of the beauties,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.320]   I think, of the season
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.800]   is that Christ's story always has new meaning to us
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.640]   every single year. - Deb, can I add to that
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.040]   and say what I loved was
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.000]   the kids were asking such great questions
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.400]   because you don't know what you don't know, right?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   - Yes, yes.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.280]   - And so that was an assumption
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.680]   that everybody knew the story.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.640]   And so I loved, I just laughed out loud
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.400]   when they go back home and the dad says, "How did it go?"
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.280]   And they're like, "Oh, it was horrible."
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.560]   They have all these questions and they don't know anything
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.160]   and they're obsessed with Herod
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.040]   and what happened to King Herod and the dad pauses
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.280]   and he goes, "Well, what did happen to King Herod?"
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.200]   And I'm like, "I don't know."
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   - Right, right.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.400]   It's so funny.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.880]   There are whole pieces of the story
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.480]   that we just kind of swallow and don't explore.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.200]   And well, in your mind, you're thinking,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.040]   "Yeah, but that's not the point of the story."
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   But like who decided that that wasn't the point of the story
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.120]   and maybe it would be more of a point of the story
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.560]   if we explored it a little bit.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.440]   Yeah, I think that's really cool.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.760]   I wonder, I'm thinking about it,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.640]   you guys were saying it helps the people
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.200]   who are watching the pageant
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   and the people who are even helping with the pageant,
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.480]   it gives you a different sense of the message.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.560]   It gives you a different message
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   when the herdmans introduce a new perspective.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.680]   But think about if you are the child
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   who has the same role every year in the Christmas pageant,
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.720]   then you only know the story from that one perspective.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   Maybe you don't know the whole story at all.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.080]   And it sounds like the herdmans,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.320]   because they were unfamiliar with the story,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.080]   so very unfamiliar with the story,
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.440]   that they were curious about all of the parts
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.400]   and how it all fit together in ways that I think
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.760]   when we pigeonhole kids
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.360]   and just give them a shepherd part every year
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.920]   and they never think about the Mary and Joseph part
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.440]   or they never think about the wise men
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   and what they might have felt.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.320]   I think it helps us,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.960]   a movie or a book like this helps us to see
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.360]   all the pieces of the story
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.760]   and how they might fit together.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.440]   - Yeah, it was neat to see Imogene's portrayal in the movie
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.400]   and just the way that she said,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.360]   "Mary must've been tough," right?
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   And we have these beautiful images of Mary
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.080]   and the movie brings it out really well, so does the book.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.320]   But just because she's such a tough character
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.360]   with tough siblings and other things,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.960]   and she's able to just really show,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.920]   "Hey, this girl that had to bring forth
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.480]   "the savior of the world,
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.000]   "she had some toughness in her too."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.360]   And it's just this, it's bringing forth a freshness
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.760]   that when somebody else plays the role, like you said,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.680]   they can see it in a whole different way
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.160]   than maybe the person who did the previous year
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.920]   or even just, and then when we see it,
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.280]   we bring that new life to the story as well,
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.120]   which is great.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.200]   - Even down to the gifts that they brought,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.400]   them questioning like,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.360]   "Why would they bring these gifts to a baby?"
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.760]   And then in the end for the kids to bring something that,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.840]   they brought the ham that was so important to them,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.280]   something that they only got once a year
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.080]   and they were, what is the word?
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:53.000]   Like the imagery of them giving up something
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.160]   that was so important to them for this moment.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.480]   - Yeah, it was a real sacrifice.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.400]   - Right.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.200]   - It was a real sacrifice.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   And that they were moved to sacrifice
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.840]   gives a whole new understanding,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.480]   a whole new version of the story.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.800]   So let me ask you this, Jamie, what is the tone?
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.640]   Okay, you've read the book and seen the movie, correct?
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.480]   - Yes.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.080]   - So what was the tone of the book?
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.600]   When you read the book or if you remember
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.360]   when you read it for the first time,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.120]   what was the tone of the book like?
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.680]   - I just remember it being very funny
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.720]   that my imagination just went really wild
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.800]   with how things were described.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.120]   And yet at the same time, within seconds,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.600]   I could be crying just because of the poignant questions
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.760]   that these children would ask.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.120]   Because like y'all said, they had no idea.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   And it's a very, very easy read, like you said,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.840]   just to be able to pick it up and finish it in one setting.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.480]   We would take it, we'd drive a little ways to get to church.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.400]   And so as our children were growing up every December,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.320]   this book was the book that came with us on one Sunday
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.120]   and would read it aloud.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.880]   And we tended to get through it in one Sunday.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   And very much just a sweet memory of reading that together.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.200]   - Yeah.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.520]   - It makes for a really good read aloud
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.280]   because it's real approachable for little kids
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.320]   because the characters, the children in there
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.640]   talk and think like your children.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.160]   They talk and think like real children
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.120]   and they ask the real questions.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.880]   And we've all had, you've all said it,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.120]   we all knew kids like the Herdmans.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.800]   We all went to school.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   We all hid from kids like the Herdmans, or avoided them.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   And then we all also had Goody Two-Shoes friends,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.000]   or maybe we were the Goody Two-Shoes friend,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   who was always looking to complain about the Herdmans
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   or about whoever was doing the part wrong.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:39.160]   And so it's very, very approachable.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   And it's funny.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   And it's funny.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.800]   And what about the movie, Jamie?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.840]   Do you feel like the tone of the book and the movie
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.000]   are compatible?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.160]   Are they the same?
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.760]   Will we be surprised?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.120]   - They are very compatible.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.960]   My husband and I were talking about it
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.560]   because the one thing that we both walked away from
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.200]   was, wow, we thought the movie would be funnier.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.560]   - OK.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.720]   - And so that was the one little letdown.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.560]   But the more we thought about it, we're like,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.080]   you know what?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.360]   When you're reading a book and you're not seeing pictures,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.640]   your brain and imagination runs wild.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   But in a movie, they give you almost limitations
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.840]   of what your brain can do because they're showing you.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.400]   And so I think that's why it didn't come across as funny.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.120]   There are great laughing points in it.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   But I specifically took my dad to the movie
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.000]   because he's the type of guy who will roll in the floor,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.760]   basically, because he's laughing so hard.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.800]   And so I told all my children, I said,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.400]   we're going with grandpa.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.680]   We're going to watch this so that I can watch him.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.040]   And it did eventually get him chuckling really well.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.720]   In fact, I'll share my favorites later on.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.560]   But there were just so many parts in the book
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.240]   where I remember myself rolling in the floor.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.440]   And it didn't happen as often in the movie.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.080]   But I think it's because of that limitation of your imagination
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.560]   being limited to what you're seeing
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.400]   versus what you can create in your mind
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.520]   without an image in front of you.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.200]   - Yeah, it's so funny.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.840]   There are some really laugh out loud.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.360]   Even if you're reading it, if you're reading the book,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.320]   if you're reading it to yourself,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.640]   there are some laugh out loud moments in the book.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.800]   And I'm going to let everybody share their favorite moment.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.760]   And then you can talk about your favorite moment in the book.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.040]   And if the movie treated it well,
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.160]   or if you have a different favorite moment in the book.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.360]   Babs, I'll start with you.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:50.240]   So what is your favorite part of the story?
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.960]   And if you have one favorite part in the book
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.320]   and a different favorite part in the movie, that's fine.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.160]   But if you have a favorite part in the book,
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.440]   I want you to talk about how the movie handled
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.920]   that part of the story and if you were satisfied.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.400]   So Babs, you go first.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.160]   What's your favorite part of this story?
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.000]   - OK, this is going to be really weird, probably.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.960]   But my favorite part, and it's only because, like I said,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.040]   we did the play when I was a kid,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.560]   is this one part where Imogene is talking to--
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.880]   I think her name is--
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.840]   it's the daughter.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.400]   I think-- oh, and Beth, because Grace was the mom
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.080]   and Beth was the daughter.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.600]   So she's talking to her because she's basically telling her,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.720]   do not raise your hand to be married.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.960]   And so this is what she said.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.800]   I'll just quote it.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.240]   I'll just read it.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.000]   So it says, "Next spring, when the pussy willows come out,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.040]   I'll stick a pussy willow so far down your ear
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   where nobody can reach it.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.920]   And it'll sprout there.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.760]   And it'll grow.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.800]   And it'll grow.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.720]   And you'll spend the rest of your life
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.360]   with a pussy willow bush growing out of your ear."
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.800]   I don't know why.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.600]   That's my favorite.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.400]   And I think it's just because I see the kids, the two girls
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.160]   that were playing it in our church, I see them.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   And I hear their voice.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.000]   - Oh, my gosh.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.920]   Yes.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Yes.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.040]   See, that's one of the things that's so real.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.480]   I mean, that is the kind of thing
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.040]   that one little kid would say to another little kid
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.600]   if they knew how to best bother the other child.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.200]   And so it's just so real.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.760]   No grown-up would ever think of threatening you that way.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.600]   But a kid would absolutely think of that.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.480]   So does that part make it into the movie, Babs?
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.240]   - It does.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.840]   I don't think it was as amazing as I envisioned it
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.440]   from our Christmas play.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.160]   So that was kind of--
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.520]   but she did do a good job.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.560]   I mean, she did say exactly the same thing.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.520]   I think my favorite part of the movie, though--
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.160]   and obviously, I'm an adult, so it's a little bit different--
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   - Right.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.840]   - --was when it's kind of the spotlight is on Imogene as Mary.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.200]   And so it's like--
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.800]   and she cries.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.560]   There's tears in her eyes.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.520]   So I think she realizes what Mary is and what Mary done.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.240]   And I think it just kind of touches her.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.280]   And then I think the audience sees that.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.560]   And then they are moved by it.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.680]   And so I think that became my favorite part of the movie
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.120]   itself, because you can read that.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.640]   And I think you can try to envision that.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.240]   But I think seeing everybody's faces
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.480]   and how they moved at just Imogene playing Mary,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.160]   that was my favorite part of the movie.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.880]   - Yeah.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:44.240]   Watching that understanding dawn on that child
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.880]   does something to you.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.320]   And it hopefully will make something
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.720]   dawn in each one of us as well.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.960]   OK, Deb, what's your favorite part of the story?
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.320]   And is it the same favorite part in the book and in the movie?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.280]   - Oh, it's definitely the ham.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.920]   - So talk about the ham.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   - Oh, my goodness.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.560]   Just the concept, as Jennifer was even saying,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.400]   of these three boys coming down as the Wise Men.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.000]   And they're just carrying this ham to lay at the manger.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   It's so, so funny.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.120]   But it's also so beautiful at the same time,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.240]   which is when I read it, I just went, oh, my goodness.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.440]   That is just fabulous that they're owning the story.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.680]   They're owning the part and bringing
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.320]   a sacrifice to the baby Jesus, bringing a real gift, which
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.360]   they didn't have the beauty of that in their poverty,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.760]   to bring something that was so valuable to them.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.600]   Food, right?
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.280]   That's like a half of the book was how
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.800]   they want food all the time, right?
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   They want the desserts and the snacks at church
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.240]   and all these other things.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.040]   And they're willing to sacrifice it
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.440]   because this story all of a sudden has meaning to them.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.240]   And that, I think, was by far my favorite part in the book.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   And I think they did an amazing job with it in the movie.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.520]   One of the twists that they put on the ham in the movie
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.040]   is that the dad, which isn't in the book, the dad in the movie
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   actually goes home to home for the church
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.680]   and brings the Christmas baskets with the food
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.720]   and the different things.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.840]   And they go to the herdman's with the ham.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.400]   And you just have such more of a personal revelation
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.320]   as you see them fighting over the ham and Imogene saying,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.080]   he didn't eat it yet.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.480]   And they're all hammering over it.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.320]   And you see that in the end that this gift that
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.760]   was given to them, they turn around
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   and they give back to the baby Jesus.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.360]   And they don't want it back.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.960]   They say, no, we don't want it back.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.920]   We gave it.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.280]   And that is just so beautiful.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.440]   And I just loved that twist that they put on it in the movie.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.040]   And I thought it was a good--
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.720]   I thought it was a good upgrade.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.520]   Oh, thank you for sharing that.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:12.160]   I think it's very poignant that what the children understand
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:19.960]   about giving a gift of honor and of sacrifice
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.040]   is amazing given how new their knowledge of the Christmas
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.400]   story is that they have jumped to that level of understanding
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.800]   is so, so very cool.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.440]   All right, Jennifer, what's your favorite part of the story?
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.160]   And is it the same in the book and the movie for you?
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.600]   Well, everybody took mine.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   It's the problem with going after others.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.640]   I was like, over here, I'd write something down.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.760]   And then somebody else would go, I scratched it out.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.600]   OK, I'm going to come up with something else.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.240]   So I think one of the things that I loved in the book--
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.000]   and it was in the movie too, but it wasn't
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.240]   my favorite part of the movie.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   But one of the things that I loved in the book
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:07.200]   was the way that their daughter, her view of the herdsmen
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.800]   shifted, and she started defending them.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.720]   Yes.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.640]   When-- I don't remember the character's name--
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.880]   the quote, unquote, "good girl" that usually appears.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.080]   Is it Alice?
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.880]   Is it Alice?
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.040]   Maybe-- anyway, anyway.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.120]   It sounds like it would be an Alice, right?
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.720]   No offense to any Alice's out there.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.120]   But the way that she would write things down in her notebook
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.000]   to show her mom.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.800]   And she would say--
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.000]   she would stick up for them.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.040]   And her turn from being annoyed or even scared of them
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.720]   to defending them through the book,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.040]   I thought was just a beautiful shift in her character.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   So I really liked that.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.800]   I also really like the youngest herdman,
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.400]   because I'm also a youngest and kind of wild.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.920]   So it's kind of related to her.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.720]   Gladys?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.520]   Was it Gladys?
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.360]   She was just so funny, I thought.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.280]   But my favorite part of the movie--
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.880]   I had two, and they've both already been said.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.240]   But one was when the dad was delivering the turkeys,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.280]   and the children did not know that he
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.000]   had been delivering to the herdmans for all of these years.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.240]   And it was this revelation of, wait, dad delivers hams here?
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.040]   Because that was the first time the parents had taken them
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.440]   on their route for them to be able to see that in person,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.360]   to see that they needed it.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.440]   So I loved that moment where you could see it on her face.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.080]   The actress did such a great job portraying that character.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:48.880]   And the shift right there of just the realization of how
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.120]   poor they really were.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.200]   So I loved that.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   And then I also loved the spotlight of Imogene crying.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.600]   I cried in the theater.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.200]   It was just so beautiful.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.920]   And the way that you could see the change
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.440]   in the entire congregation in that moment.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.920]   Everyone had been holding their breath
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.880]   to see what would happen.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.080]   It was that moment that the church was convicted
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.320]   and how they had behaved and what they thought
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.280]   and what they needed to do moving forward
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.560]   to care for the family.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.760]   And so I loved that moment.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.680]   - Oh, that is so good.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.640]   You know, you could just picture a church full of people
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.400]   coming to see, this is going to be a different pageant.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.360]   This is going to be a pageant unlike any we have ever
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.760]   experienced.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.280]   And they were right, but for a completely different reason.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:40.640]   - Yes.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.560]   - That's so cool.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.400]   All right, Jamie, tell us if there
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.320]   are any favorite parts left.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.560]   What was your favorite part of the story?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.200]   And is it the same in the book and the movie for you?
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.520]   - So it's been a little while since I've read the book.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.920]   So I don't know.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.120]   Maybe someone who's read it recently
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.480]   can tell me if it's the same.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.640]   But there were two parts, the one being,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.960]   we mentioned Herod earlier.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.840]   And another thing that the Herdmans
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.680]   would say when they heard that the innkeeper could not
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.720]   find room for Mary and Joseph, they
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.480]   equated the innkeeper with Herod.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.520]   Like, well, he deserves the same punishment.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.800]   Why wouldn't he find a pregnant woman's space somewhere?
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:35.400]   Why can't he help them better than a trough for baby Jesus?
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.360]   And so just their emphatic feelings
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.200]   of injustice being done.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.320]   I don't know that I've ever thought about the innkeeper
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.120]   in that way ever.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.200]   - So that was one of them.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.920]   And then the second one was Gladys, the youngest Herdman.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.280]   Her portrayal of the angel coming to the shepherds,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.760]   she just takes this stance of her legs split apart,
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.080]   her fist on her hips.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.840]   And she goes, hey, the shepherd was born.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.680]   And she just says it in that country accent
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.840]   and just tries to get everybody's attention
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.920]   and just doesn't say it with the hallelujah
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.160]   chorus in the background.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.520]   - Right, right.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.760]   - He's like, yeah, this is very important.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.440]   Pay attention.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.840]   Listen to me.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.720]   - Yeah, it's so funny that these kids who never really
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.240]   knew the story treat it like it is
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.760]   a real story about real people who are doing
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.040]   real things for real reasons.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.680]   And that is how the people are able to view
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.800]   the story at this different pageant
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.840]   than they ever expected it.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.520]   I think sometimes we are so used to the Christmas story.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.800]   And it's just a story.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.160]   It's sort of like a fairy tale.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.960]   It's just a story that we hear.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.600]   And we're so familiar with it.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.960]   It can go through our minds without really touching
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   our heart sometimes until we're moved to see it
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.800]   like the Herdmans did.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:35.520]   It is a real story about real people doing things
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.280]   that really happened.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:45.320]   And so they would have real emotions and real problems.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.520]   And so to me, that was a huge eye-opening experience.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.080]   The Herdmans are hearing the story for the first time.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:58.160]   And so they say things like, what kind of a cheap king
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.040]   brings oil for a brand new baby as a present?
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.160]   That's a dumb present.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.080]   And so they're thinking, what would be best in this situation?
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.600]   Or how might people really act in this situation?
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.360]   Or how would they feel?
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.720]   Or what does it mean?
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   And I think that would be a good thing for us
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.960]   all to remember, too.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.120]   I want to know, some of you have probably
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.360]   read this multiple times.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.800]   And maybe you first read it when you were a kid.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:36.560]   Or you had it read aloud to you when you were a young person.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.520]   Can you remember what was the takeaway for you
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.920]   the first time you read it?
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.720]   And if you read it before, we're now all moms.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   And so we probably read this a little differently.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.200]   We see these kids from a different perspective.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.480]   We see having to inherit this Christmas pageant director job
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.200]   way differently than we probably did as a child.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.920]   What was the big message for you the first time you read it?
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.960]   And is it any different?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.440]   Do you have a different take on it now?
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.800]   Deb, what about you?
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.000]   What's the takeaway message for you?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.560]   And has it always been the same takeaway?
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.520]   It's interesting.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.440]   I actually never heard of this book
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.520]   until I saw it in the CC curriculum.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.400]   Isn't that funny?
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.160]   And so it was a delight to introduce this,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.960]   not just to my children, but to myself.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.280]   And so the first time that I read it, I cried.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.080]   I saw it in the movie, and I cried.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:49.200]   And my kids do not cry when they reread this.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.560]   But I do think it's fascinating to just kind of step back,
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.960]   because they'll have memories of this in their childhood.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.280]   And I'll be interested to see how it hits them differently
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.600]   as they become parents.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.240]   But I think that as a parent reading it for the first time,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:11.960]   the beauty of Imogene's reaction and her willingness
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.280]   to see Christ for the first time,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.160]   I think that it just held so much beauty for me.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.560]   But I don't have the contrast of my childhood to compare it to.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.080]   Babs, what about you?
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.560]   What was the takeaway, the big message for you?
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.160]   Because you did encounter this book as a kid,
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.520]   as a young person.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.000]   And then now, as an adult, is the takeaway different?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.200]   Do you see it differently?
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.520]   I don't think I had a very good takeaway when I was a kid.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.800]   Because we read it, you know, to do the play at church.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.640]   And I think I was just excited that I wasn't a herdsman.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.280]   I got to play an adult.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.800]   And I think that was really my focus.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.360]   But I don't really think I got the message.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.640]   And so watching the movie, and then I
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.280]   went back and reread the book, I think
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.920]   that there's two big things that really stood out to me.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.680]   And I do think it's because of the movie,
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.840]   because when it's portrayed on a big screen,
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:19.520]   it's just easier to see sometimes, is embarrassingly,
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.280]   like, I think I saw myself in some of those church
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.120]   people who were critical.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.760]   And so because there were a couple of ladies in the movie,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.480]   and they gathered around the lady that broke her foot.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.600]   And so they were like, yeah, you shouldn't
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.560]   let them be in the play.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.480]   And this is the reason.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.720]   And all these reasons were so superficial.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.160]   And I was just like, oh, did we do that?
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   Like, we probably do.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.680]   And then the other thing, too, was
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.120]   just realizing that not everybody
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.760]   knows the Christmas story.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.920]   And that even now, I mean, 2024, there
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.960]   are still people who don't know the Christmas story like we do.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.360]   And so I love those questions that the herdsmen's have,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   because I was thinking, I never thought of that.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.600]   So I think just being sensitive to that fact,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.080]   and then really convicting me to say, well,
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   you need to be going out and telling people then.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.840]   If you know there's people out there
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.240]   who don't know this Christmas story and what Jesus did for us,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   then we should be going out there and sharing that message.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.680]   That's great.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.760]   That's great.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.920]   Jennifer, what about you?
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.000]   What do you think is the big takeaway?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.720]   I love what you offered to us as some good ways
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.040]   to talk about the message of the movie with your kids.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   That's one way to make sure that your kids who
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.840]   hear it when they're little don't miss the point.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.040]   Yeah, I'm like Deb.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:53.440]   I never heard of this until my son was in Challenge One.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.600]   And so I don't have any experience
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.720]   with it outside of that.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.120]   But I think there's just so many takeaways.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.320]   You can look at each character and have a takeaway
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.880]   from just that character.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.640]   So it's really hard to pick one.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.280]   But I think looking at the church,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.080]   the church that was the members in the movie or in the book,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.240]   I felt like the movie did a really excellent job.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.040]   Sometimes they veer way off.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.840]   I did not feel that way.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.640]   And so if we look at it from a church body perspective,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.880]   I think one of the messages is that, number one,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.360]   how are we perceived from outside people?
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.480]   Why had these children never felt
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.760]   like they could come before?
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.080]   And it was this simple--
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.360]   it wasn't an invitation.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.040]   They did not come because they were invited.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.800]   They came because the little boy was like, well,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.000]   you can take my snacks.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.560]   That's fine.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.920]   I get plenty of snacks.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.880]   I don't need that.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.440]   And even though what he said wasn't true,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.320]   they didn't come because they were invited.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   So how much sooner could they have heard that and experienced
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.840]   that had they have been invited rather than turned away?
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   And so as a church body, just that reflection on,
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.160]   are we as inviting as we think we are?
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.800]   Are we really doing the right thing?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.040]   Are there people-- even within my own home,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.400]   my kids have heard the story.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.160]   Do they really grasp it?
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.840]   Do I really grasp it?
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.680]   I think Babs was saying some of those questions
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.600]   she hadn't thought of.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   And I felt the same way.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.040]   I was like, man, sometimes I just
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.440]   take things at face value.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.720]   And some of the questions that were asked through the story
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.080]   I had never thought about.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.280]   And so I'm certain that my kids probably haven't either.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.800]   So how much understanding--
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.560]   or how much of a deeper understanding
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.360]   can we start to dive into as a family
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   and then be able to tell others and invite others in?
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.400]   Are we really doing a good job of that?
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.640]   That is so good.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:02.320]   And listeners, that is what makes this book a great read
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.760]   aloud for your family and this movie a great movie
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.200]   to see with your family.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.320]   It's really relatable.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.680]   People of all ages are going to enjoy it.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.800]   It's very entertaining.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   But there's a message for us.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:25.040]   And it's a great prompt for re-examining the Christmas
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.560]   story, and it's a great prompt for re-examining our community
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.640]   and the responsibility we have to share the greatest story
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.400]   we've known with other people.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.960]   I want to give every one of you all
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   a chance to say one more great thing about the movie,
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.480]   or to tell a funny part, or something that you love,
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.880]   or the reason that you're going to take
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.240]   somebody else to the movie.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.720]   So Jamie, I'll let you be first.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.440]   And then Jennifer, I'll let you be next,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.800]   because y'all had to go last time.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.000]   So Jamie, what's your final encouragement
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.680]   to people who are going to encounter
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.240]   this story this year?
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.320]   Yeah, I think we've said it in multiple ways.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.520]   But the thing that just keeps being brought back to me
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.680]   is how much being raised in a Christian home
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:22.880]   that I missed those details that the Herdmans were
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.920]   able to bring out.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.520]   I felt like I was somewhat watching a challenge class
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   while I was in the movie theater,
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.960]   listening to all their questions.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.000]   Like, oh, that's a definition question.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.800]   Or they're naming, they're attending,
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.400]   now they're storytelling, and just going
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.760]   through all the 15 skills.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.560]   But just back to, wow, there are details
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.600]   that I just took for granted that I understood that maybe I
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.200]   should have dug deeper and should
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.840]   to know more about my Savior.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.760]   Oh, that's really good, Jamie.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.440]   All right, Jennifer, one last thing.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.440]   You sure we don't have two more hours?
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.440]   I know, we could.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.440]   I think we all enjoyed it enough that we could
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.240]   talk a long time about it.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.280]   I think my takeaway would be, or my suggestion, I guess,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.880]   would be, I hope that people invite people outside
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.600]   of your circle to the movie.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.840]   Because what a great way to start a conversation
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.520]   with somebody who thinks that they're just
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.080]   going to watch a cute movie.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.240]   And so I really hope that the movie
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:39.960]   does a great job of bringing others into the church,
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.440]   as well.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.960]   And we can do that by inviting people outside
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.400]   of just our little bubble and opening that conversation.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.440]   So I hope that I do a better job myself
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.040]   of reaching outside of my comfort zone
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.240]   and my little protective bubble of people.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   And just do a better job of reaching out
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.840]   to people who are like the Herdmans
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.280]   and digging into a need that they
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.920]   may have that I'm overlooking.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.680]   Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.080]   I mean, who knows, somebody's life may be changed,
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.480]   just like Emma Jean's was.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.440]   All right, Babs.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.200]   So something that I think is a takeaway for me--
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.760]   and I was thinking about this earlier.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.360]   I don't know if it's the biggest takeaway,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.600]   but it's just something that we haven't talked about--
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.360]   is that the Herdmans research their parts.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.280]   They went to the library and they researched their parts.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.120]   And it made me think, do I really
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:43.800]   spend time in the Bible, like digging in and researching?
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.840]   Because we talked about this yesterday at church.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.480]   It was funny about how there's so many things
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.400]   we can learn about God just by reading any scripture, right?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.840]   You just pick any scripture and you can learn that He's
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.760]   a creator, or that He's loving, or that He's omnipresent,
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.480]   right, and all the things.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.440]   And so I was thinking, I need to spend more time
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.360]   like digging into the Word and researching
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:12.240]   the attributes of God, or maybe the disciples, or Jesus.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.320]   And so I feel like we don't maybe always do that.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.800]   Because we're talking about this,
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.080]   we don't get a reward for like digging in.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.800]   We get a reward for like, oh, I read
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.080]   through the Bible in a year, right?
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.000]   There's no accolade, if that's what we're looking for,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.800]   to say, oh, I really dug into this book of the Bible
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.440]   this year, or whatever.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.280]   And so I think that's a goal that I
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.640]   want to have is these little kids research their part.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.520]   And what they were really doing is like digging in and trying
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.400]   to find as much as they could out about these people.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.720]   And if we could do that with the scripture
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.040]   that God has given us, I think it will make
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.880]   a big difference in our lives.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.560]   That's a great encouragement.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:03.360]   All right, Deb, last chance to tell us to say a takeaway.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.840]   I think as I'm listening to everyone,
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.520]   it definitely makes me want to refocus on this Advent season
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:14.040]   coming up and really ponder the story more.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:18.480]   But mixed with that, I think another standout moment for me
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.160]   was that when Charlie, the little brother,
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.040]   said they had to go up in front of their Sunday school class
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.240]   and say what they like most about church.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.920]   And everybody's giving their cute little Jesus answers.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.680]   And he said what everyone was thinking,
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.000]   but no one would ever dare say aloud, which is he said,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.720]   I like Sunday school because the herdman's aren't here.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.800]   And I think the whole point of the book
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.280]   is that the herdman's were supposed to be there.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.840]   And that as we're entering the Advent season,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.360]   it's saying the people who weren't
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.280]   supposed to be at the manger were the ones who
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.400]   were, the shepherds, right?
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.200]   The lowly, they're in that impoverished place.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.280]   And the Son of God is being born in a manger.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.880]   And I think the whole point of this Advent season
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.720]   is to remember that it's a change of heart of the ones
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.520]   that who aren't supposed to be there actually
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.520]   are the ones who are supposed to be there,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.440]   and just remembering that this Advent season.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.840]   That is beautiful.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.920]   The story is for all of us, and we are all supposed to be here.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.040]   So bring somebody.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.440]   Bring somebody to hear the story.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:30.320]   Bring somebody to meet the Lord this Advent season.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.080]   Thank you guys so much for encouraging our listeners
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.600]   to embrace this story.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.080]   And guys, we actually, I would love it
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.720]   if you would have this as a read aloud for your families.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.920]   But this week, we are actually advocating
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.800]   that you go see the movie.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.840]   So this movie is at theaters now.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.520]   I saw it.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.360]   I saw it on the marquee just yesterday.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.760]   So the best Christmas pageant ever movie is out now.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.040]   And we encourage you to take your families,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   to have some discussion with your families,
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.800]   to bring your community.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.880]   It'd be a great community outreach or community
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.200]   fellowship.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   But like my friends have said, bring somebody
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.240]   outside of your circle so that maybe they
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.640]   can see in the treatment that the movie gives the Christmas
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.040]   pageant, the Christmas story.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.240]   They can get some of their questions answered too.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:31.920]   All right, guys.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.200]   Thank you, Babs and Jamie and Deb and Jennifer.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.440]   Thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.480]   I really appreciate y'all.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.320]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:40.960]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.240]   Yeah, thank you for having us.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.200]   It was so good.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.640]   Thank you.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.240]   Listeners, I'll see you next week.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:47.760]   Bye.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.180]   you
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.240]   you
