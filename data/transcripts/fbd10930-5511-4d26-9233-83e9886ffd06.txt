[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.000]   in the right direction.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   For this episode, I wanted to focus much of the time to talk about Margaret Sanger while
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.960]   at the end comparing her to Mildred Jefferson.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.200]   Before I begin this episode, I want to state as is true for every episode that I've ever
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.480]   done, my goal is to not attack people per se.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   I am not trying to attack people, I am trying to point out ideas and movements.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.040]   But as you know, ideas are connected with people.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   So if we're going to have an intellectual, dispassionate conversation, we need to be
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   frank, candid, and direct while not giving sway to unbridled emotion, logic must prevail.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.680]   To the extent that it matters to any of the listeners, I've had and continue to have close
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.240]   people who've had abortions much, much closer to me than you might even know.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.080]   I do not hate people who've had abortions because if I did, then that would mean I would
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.760]   hate some of the people closest to me.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.680]   At the same time, I will not sacrifice truth and I will not circumvent talking about topics
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.280]   that need to be talked about because that would be inherently unloving.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.580]   With that disclaimer, on to the episode.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.600]   To start off, Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood, the same Planned Parenthood
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.280]   that has locations all across the country and performs the majority of the abortions
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.040]   in the United States.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.800]   The same Planned Parenthood that has strategically placed about 88% of their locations in urban
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   areas.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.540]   Margaret Sanger was born in New York in 1879 and was embedded within socialist politics
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.640]   from early adulthood.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   By 1911, she was writing for a socialist magazine called New York Call.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   In a series for that magazine entitled "What Every Girl Should Know," she wrote two essays
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.860]   on the subject of sexual impulse.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.880]   In one of her essays, her evolutionary viewpoints for humankind and the hierarchy of the superiority
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.600]   of races was clearly on display.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   If you recall in Episode 3 on Darwinian Evolution and Scientifically Validated Racism, Episode
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.760]   3 on Darwinian Evolution and Scientifically Validated Racism, I went over the origins
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   of evolution and how it perpetrated and gave so-called intellectual cover for racism.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   For a clearer context, I'll go ahead and refer you to that episode.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.320]   My point is, in this quote I'm about to read to you, you see Margaret Sanger's worldview
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.080]   on clear display.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.840]   This is again Margaret Sanger in an essay on sexual impulse.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.560]   When man has emerged from the jungle and stood upright on his hind legs, the shape of his
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   head and his face change from the long jaw and flat head of the animal to the flat face
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.520]   and high head of the man.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.800]   All progress from that time forward was made along mental lines.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.300]   According to the universal law then in existence, he should have been limited to a geographical
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.760]   area and killed by the extreme heat or cold or starved for one kind of food if it were
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.960]   not obtained.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.680]   But against all these he fought because he became endowed with such attributes as reason,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   knowledge, and willpower.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.160]   Instead of using his creative powers solely in hunting food and reproducing his species,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.620]   he used his force in making plans for his self-preservation.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.680]   He built rafts and boats to cross rivers and streams.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.840]   He devised methods of clothing himself against extreme heat and cold and discovered various
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.340]   ways of preparing food for different climates suitable for his various needs.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.440]   In other words, he conserved his creative force and redirected it into channels which
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.960]   have resulted in giving him precedence over all other living creatures.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.260]   For man has developed a conscious mind which asserts itself by reasoning, which in turn
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.440]   has developed his brain power.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   It is said a fish as large as a man has a brain no longer than the kernel of an almond.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.160]   In all fish and reptiles where there is no great brain development, there is also no
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.200]   conscious sexual control.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.040]   The lower down in the scale of human development we go, the less sexual control we find.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.400]   It is said that the Aboriginal Australian, the lowest known species of the human family,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.920]   just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development, has so little sexual control
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.840]   that police authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.280]   According to one writer, the rapist has just enough brain development to raise him above
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.080]   the animal, but like the animal, when in heat knows no law except nature which impels him
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.960]   to procreate whatever the result.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.000]   Every normal man and woman has the power to control and direct his sexual impulse.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.160]   Men and women who have it in control and constantly use their brain cells in thinking deeply are
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.620]   never sensual."
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.320]   From the quote I read to you, you could clearly see the implication that she believed in a
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.020]   hierarchy and superiority of differing races much like Darwin espoused.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.200]   After all, Darwin's magnum opus is called "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.620]   Selection or the Preservation of Favorite Races in the Struggle for Life."
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:35.580]   In 1914, Sanger launched a newsletter using the slogan, "No Gods, No Masters."
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.460]   This slogan is interesting because it dated back to England in the 19th century used by
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.500]   anarchists and socialists.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.740]   The origins of the English usage goes back to Louis-Auguste Blanqui, who was a French
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.980]   socialist and political activist.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:58.140]   The French term was "Neither God nor Master."
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:06.620]   Unsurprisingly, this term was shared by Friedrich Nietzsche in "Beyond Good and Evil."
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.220]   Sometime afterwards, she founded the American Birth Control League and began to promote
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.060]   her organization by speaking for various groups, one of those groups being the KKK.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.620]   In 1948, she started what would become today's Planned Parenthood.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.260]   She died at the age of 86 in 1966 in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.740]   For the next segment of this episode, I want to quote to you verbatim some articles written
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.100]   about Margaret Sanger that I did indeed fact check.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.380]   I'm quoting these articles to you to give you and bring more color to who Margaret Sanger
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380]   was.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   Irina Grossu, A-R-I-N-A Grossu, G-R-O-S-S-U, who is the Director for the Center for Human
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.020]   Dignity at the Family Research Council, wrote the following in an article entitled "Margaret
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.460]   Sanger, Racist Eugenicist Extraordinaire."
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.940]   She wrote this on May 5, 2014.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:16.620]   Irina Grossu says, "Recent articles have reported on an unearthed video from 1947 of
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.820]   Margaret Sanger demanding no more babies for 10 years in developing countries.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.820]   A couple of years ago, Margaret Sanger was named one of Time Magazine's 20 Most Influential
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.020]   Americans of All Time.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.980]   Given her enduring influence, it's worth considering what the women who founded Planned Parenthood
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   contributed to the eugenics movement.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.420]   Sanger shaped the eugenics movement in America and beyond in the 1930s and 1940s.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.100]   Her views and those of her peers in the movement contributed to compulsory sterilization laws
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.460]   in 30 U.S. states that resulted in more than 60,000 sterilizations of vulnerable people,
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.680]   including people she considered feeble-minded, idiots, and morons.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.960]   She even presented at a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1926 in Silver Lake, New Jersey.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.660]   She recounted this event in her autobiography.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.900]   "I accepted an invitation to talk to the women's branch of the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.740]   I saw through the door dim figures parading with banners and illuminated crosses.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.100]   I was escorted to the platform, was introduced, and began to speak.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.220]   In the end, through simple illustrations, I believed I had accomplished my purpose.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.380]   A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered."
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:33.620]   Margaret Sanger, in Autobiography, page 366.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.540]   That she generated enthusiasm among some of America's leading racists says something
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.020]   about the content and tone of her remarks.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:48.500]   In a letter to Clarence Gable in 1939, Sanger wrote, "We do not want word to go out that
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.780]   we want to exterminate the (insert archaic word for black person here) population, and
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.180]   the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.920]   their more rebellious members."
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.800]   That was Margaret Sanger in a letter to Gable, December 10, 1939.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.700]   Her own words and television appearances leave no room for parsing.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.140]   For example, she wrote many articles about eugenics in the journal she founded in 1917,
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.740]   The Birth Control Review.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:25.020]   Her articles included "Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics," "The Eugenic Conscience,"
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.780]   "The Purpose of Eugenics," "Birth Control and Positive Eugenics," and "Birth Control,
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.060]   the True Eugenics," to name a few.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.260]   The following are some of her more telling quotes.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.980]   "While I personally believe in the sterilization of the feeble-minded, the insane, and syphilitic,
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.860]   I have not been able to discover that these measures are more than superficial deterrence
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.320]   when applied to the constantly growing stream of the unfit.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.620]   They are excellent means of meeting a certain phase of the situation, but I believe in regard
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.700]   to these, as in regard to other eugenic means, that they do not go to the bottom of the matter."
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:08.460]   That is in Birth Control and Racial Betterment, February 1919, The Birth Control Review.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.300]   "Eugenics without birth control seems to us a house builded upon the sands.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.860]   It is at the mercy of the rising stream of the unfit.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.740]   Stop our national habit of human waste.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.580]   By all means, there should be no children when either mother or father suffers from
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:35.900]   such diseases as tuberculosis, gonorrhea, syphilis, cancer, epilepsy, insanity, drunkenness,
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   and mental disorders.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.860]   In the case of the mother, heart disease, kidney trouble, and pelvic deformities are
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.900]   also a serious bar to childbearing.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.260]   No more children should be born when the parents, though healthy themselves, find that their
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.120]   children are physically or mentally defective.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.780]   The main objects of the Population Congress would be to apply a stern and rigid policy
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.180]   of sterilization and segregation to that great a population whose progeny is tainted or whose
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:13.120]   inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring to give certain
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:20.260]   dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization."
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.220]   In a 1957 interview with Mike Wallace, Sanger revealed, "I think the greatest sin in the
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.260]   world is bringing children into the world that have disease from their parents that
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.960]   have no chance in the world to be a human being practically, delinquents, prisoners,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.740]   all sorts of things just marked when they're born.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:45.940]   That to me is the greatest sin that people can, can commit."
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.540]   This line of thinking from its founder has left lasting remarks on the legacy of Planned
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.540]   Parenthood.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.060]   For example, 79% of Planned Parenthood's surgical abortion facilities are located within
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.800]   a walking distance of Black or Hispanic communities.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.860]   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Abortion Surveillance Report revealed that
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:11.020]   between 2007 and 2010, nearly 36% of all abortions in the United States were performed on Black
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.900]   children even though Black Americans make up only 13% of our population.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:22.180]   A further 21% of abortions were performed on Hispanics and 7% more on other minority
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:29.540]   groups for a total of 64% of U.S. abortions tragically performed on minority groups.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:39.620]   Margaret Sanger would have been proud of the effects of her legacy."
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:46.300]   There's a database online of most if not all of Margaret Sanger's works.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.040]   I read through a good chunk of her material.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:57.580]   But if you want to fact check the material, feel free to go ahead and do it yourself.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:04.260]   So what does Planned Parenthood have to say about its founder today given the state of
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.480]   the culture?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:18.520]   After all, what I read to you should be considered, if there were consistency, extremely offensive.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:25.160]   So what does Planned Parenthood have to say about its founder today given the state of
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.560]   the culture?
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:34.760]   K. Cole James, President and Founder of the Klaus Schuster Institute and also current
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.420]   president of the Heritage Foundation.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.520]   To the extent that it matters to you, K. Cole James is a Black female.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.780]   She wrote an article this year for the Heritage Foundation on June 29 entitled "Even with
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.620]   removing Margaret Sanger's name, Planned Parenthood is still influenced by a racist
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.620]   founder."
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.300]   It was published June 29, 2020 for the Heritage Foundation.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:09.820]   K. Cole James writes, "One of Planned Parenthood's largest abortion affiliates has finally disavowed
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.060]   Planned Parenthood's founder for her racist legacy and her connections to the eugenics
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.060]   movement.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.060]   However, this symbolic bowing to the far-left's "cancel culture" doesn't change the fact
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.940]   that the organization is still influenced by her inhumane beliefs.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.860]   Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (PPGNY) is finally removing Margaret Sanger's name
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:36.220]   from its Manhattan clinic after decades of choosing to overlook the organization's
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.260]   white supremacist roots.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.020]   Sanger said all sorts of disturbing things like, "We don't want the word to get out
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:48.100]   that we want to exterminate the (insert archaic word for Black person here) population."
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.080]   She favored the forced sterilization of those she deemed unfit.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.880]   She gave a speech to the Ku Klux Klan and she once wrote, "The most merciful thing
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.500]   that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it."
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.660]   Mind you, like Virginia Governor Northam, she was talking about a child who had already
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.220]   been born.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.680]   PPGNY's national organization, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, has long said that
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.420]   many of Sanger's racist quotes have been taken out of context.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.700]   While the national organization acknowledges some of Sanger's many flaws, it says her
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.960]   story is "complicated" and it hasn't totally disavowed her.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.460]   It still labels her a "woman of heroic accomplishments" and it still calls its highest honor the "Margaret
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.460]   Sanger Award."
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.780]   However, in its news release, PPGNY parted ways with the standard talking points, acknowledging
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:46.640]   what it called "Planned Parenthood's contribution to historical reproductive harm within communities
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   of color."
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.220]   Yet for years, Planned Parenthood has had the audacity to claim that it believes Black
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.160]   lives matter.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.660]   As we know all too well, the "cancel culture" is one of the far left's frequently used
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:05.540]   tools to destroy anyone or anything that doesn't comport with its racial ideology.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.300]   Ever at a loss for hypocrisy though, the left frequently attempts to nuance the troubling
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:16.660]   pasts of its heroes, trying to make them acceptable while at the same time tearing down statues
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.060]   of those who helped make America the exceptional nation it is.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.300]   Some will accuse me of having a double standard when I say that it's okay to cancel Margaret
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.380]   Sanger while I defend statesmen like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, yet there's
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.460]   a significant difference.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.060]   While we roundly condemn Washington's and Jefferson's participation in the evil of
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.700]   slavery, we can still celebrate their lifelong work to create a nation built on the highest
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.860]   ideals of humanity.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.820]   On the other hand, Sanger's open racism, her promotion of eugenics, and her advocacy
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:55.540]   of forced sterilizations to keep those she deemed unfit from breeding was her vision.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.580]   Planned Parenthood was formed on that vision, and much of that vision still exists at Planned
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.460]   Parenthood today.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.600]   Planned Parenthood still considers certain people less than human and rejects the science
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:13.460]   of prenatal development by calling babies in the womb clumps of cells, tissue masses,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.860]   and products of conception.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.740]   Planned Parenthood also still targets minority communities.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.660]   If Black Lives Matter to Planned Parenthood, then why, according to a 2015 study, are nearly
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:30.220]   80% of its surgical abortion facilities located within walking distance of minority neighborhoods?
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.580]   According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014, a year when Black women only accounted
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:40.460]   for about 13% of the U.S. population, they made up 28% of those having abortions.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.580]   Each year in New York City, more Black babies are aborted than born.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.380]   Pro-lifers have been pointing out Sanger's despicable views for decades, and Planned
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.940]   Parenthood didn't just find out about Sanger's past yesterday.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.740]   So why is Planned Parenthood only now rejecting its founder?
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.700]   And why isn't the entire organization doing it?
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.260]   It strikes me how blatantly we see the double standard at work here.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.900]   Sure, Sanger is getting canceled, but only at one of Planned Parenthood's facilities,
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.140]   and in a relatively mild way.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.580]   Planned Parenthood still talks about the good she allegedly did, and is willing to ascribe
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.180]   her transgressions to being a "woman of her time."
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.540]   How ironic that the left doesn't give America's founders the same courtesy.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.180]   There's no allowance for context, no allowance for being "men of their time."
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.220]   There is only cancellation and demands that everything they produced, for example America,
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.640]   be destroyed.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.580]   Until Planned Parenthood stops dehumanizing living, growing children in the womb, until
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.980]   it ceases performing abortions, and until it stops locating facilities and advertising
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.940]   heavily in and around minority communities, it will continue carrying out Margaret Sanger's
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.860]   original vision.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.980]   Canceling Margaret Sanger and the symbolic gesture of removing her name from a building
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.900]   won't change any of that.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.060]   Let me be absolutely clear about something.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:15.820]   I'm not detailing the life of Margaret Sanger because of republicanism.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.660]   I'm not detailing the life of Margaret Sanger because of republicanism.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.140]   In the last episode, I've already detailed to you when life begins.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:33.980]   If life indeed does begin at conception, then the undeniable conclusion is that modern-day
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:41.060]   abortion could easily be equivocated with child sacrifice we see in the scriptures.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.500]   That is empirically proven, but in case you think I'm taking it out of proportion, listen
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.260]   to what Governor Ralph Northam stated on the issue of infanticide.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.300]   This is the same quote alluded to by K. Cole James in the article that I just quoted to
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   you.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:05.380]   Again, these are babies who survive abortion that are outside the womb.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.780]   Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia states this in 2019.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.240]   If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.260]   The infant would be delivered.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.820]   The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:25.380]   The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.580]   And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:36.100]   So I think this was really blown out of proportion.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.300]   Don't worry.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:44.060]   If we miss on the first try, we'll certainly get them on the second, Dr. Menegly."
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:50.700]   Let me say that last part again.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:57.260]   This is Governor Ralph Northam talking about babies who are born from botched abortions
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.620]   outside the womb.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.020]   "Don't worry.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:12.700]   If we miss on the first try, we'll certainly get them on the second, Dr. Menegly."
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:19.100]   Indeed as I'm producing this episode, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.260]   still hasn't passed.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:27.700]   The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, that is the same bill that's been introduced
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.660]   by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:36.400]   That is a bill that aims to protect living human beings from botched abortions instead
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.580]   of murdering them when they are outside the womb and this country has slid so far that
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.180]   this is now controversial.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:53.700]   It is now too political to call out infanticide.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:06.180]   However, we will not let culturally induced dialectics dictate what is merely political
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.240]   versus what is objectively right.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:19.940]   And believe me, calling out infanticide, what I'm saying right now, calling it out is going
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.440]   to age very well.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:32.220]   And just like we judge the generation that didn't fight to abolish slavery or Jim Crow
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:41.260]   laws, generations in the future will look back and judge us.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:48.360]   What I'm telling you right now is going to age very well.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:57.140]   In every way, this is just like the infanticide described in the scriptures just transferred
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.700]   to fit contemporary society.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.240]   Let me prove it to you by showing you what the scriptures say concerning this barbaric
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   practice.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.700]   Leviticus 18.21 says this, "You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.580]   Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.700]   I am the Lord."
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.900]   Deuteronomy 18.10, "There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.380]   daughter pass through the fire.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.940]   One who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens or
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.940]   a sorcerer."
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:34.900]   2 Kings 21.6, "He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft, and used divination,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.000]   and dealt with mediums and spiritists.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.860]   He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger."
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:46.300]   2 Chronicles 33.6, "He made his son pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-Hinnom,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.140]   and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.380]   and spiritists.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.140]   He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger."
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:02.920]   Isaiah 57.5, "Who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.860]   Who slaughter the children in the ravines, under the clefts of the crags?"
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.820]   Jeremiah 7.31, "They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:18.580]   son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.540]   and it did not come into my mind."
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.780]   Jeremiah 32.35, "They built the high places of Baal, that are in the valley of Ben-Hinnom,
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.260]   to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.500]   not commanded them, nor had it entered my mind that they should do this abomination
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.180]   to cause Judah to sin."
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:45.900]   Psalm 106.35-38, "But they mingled with the nations, and learned their practices, and
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.940]   served their idols, which became a snare to them.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:26:00.180]   They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons."
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:09.900]   They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:16.260]   Perhaps some of you are listening to this, and you're moved.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.140]   This information is new to you.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.220]   You're wondering what you could do to help.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:30.940]   Let me tell you what we could all do, each and every one of us.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:41.020]   And I want to say, before I tell you what we could all do, I want to say, yes, perhaps
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:47.660]   some of us will be called to do something more radical in terms of visible occupations.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:56.420]   And yes, some will be led to do more substantive work, like Samuel Say over at Slow2Write.com.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:03.740]   If you don't know Samuel Say, he is a blogger extraordinaire, a pro-life advocate.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:12.300]   If you ever catch his story, he'll tell you about how he has saved in one summer 70-80
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.980]   lives by just talking to people outside of abortion clinics.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   He's doing amazing work.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.260]   Go check him out at Slow2Write.com.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.180]   And so maybe some of you listening will be a future Samuel Say, and yes, maybe some of
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:34.540]   you will even be moved to budget away your vacations and give monetarily.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.980]   But the real talk is, not all of us are called to leave our occupations and do legislative
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.980]   work, and you shouldn't feel bad if that's not your calling.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.100]   And we cannot all be involved in every worthy cause that exists.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.740]   Let me say that again.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:56.420]   We cannot all be involved in every worthy cause that exists.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   What I mean by that is, a worthy cause is to fight human trafficking.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.860]   A worthy cause is to fight the slaughter of civilians by Boko Haram.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.340]   A worthy cause is to help the village Christians in India.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.060]   The imprisonment of the entire country of North Korea, Iran, and so on.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:19.180]   Those are worthy causes, but not all of us are called to devote our time to every single
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.740]   worthy cause.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.520]   Even helping the disadvantaged nearby right here.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.380]   I'm not saying we shouldn't care.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.260]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:41.020]   But what I am saying is that we need to heed our calling as individuals while also considering
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.020]   that we work as a body.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:51.660]   So what is the one thing, one thing that all of us could do?
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:58.480]   That one thing is to speak truth and love.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.580]   That is the one thing that we all can do and that we all should do.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.340]   Speak truth and love right where you are.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.500]   Just open your mouth and begin to speak truth and love.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.380]   Pray for opportunities that you can speak truth and love.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.860]   If you get shut down, you get shut down.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.660]   If you've tried and they don't want to hear about it, we've all been there.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:29.060]   But my point is to just open your mouth at some point.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:36.920]   Because some point sometimes becomes no point for us if we say I'll do it later.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:43.100]   That could be with a group of your friends, your coworkers, or whatever other social connection
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.500]   you have.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.820]   And yeah, you're going to get shut down 99% of the time.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:56.540]   But you might also be surprised at how powerful speaking truth and love could be.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.500]   I want to devote an episode one day to just kind of expand upon that.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:10.780]   But you might be surprised at how powerful speaking truth and love could be and why we
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.860]   need to keep that the primacy in all things.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.140]   The gospel works inside out.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.860]   The gospel works inside out.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:32.740]   And it does indeed have an effect when it is lived out and also spoken.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:41.500]   All societies are built one brick at a time and not from systems at a time.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:47.640]   Bloom where you are planted since that is the one principle, that is one of the principles
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.660]   given to us, and that is in 1 Corinthians 7, 19-24.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:58.700]   There is a reason why the Great Commission is the Great Commission.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:04.660]   There is a reason why the last thing Christ tells his disciples, tells the apostles, was
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.940]   Matthew 28.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:14.820]   The gospel, and only the gospel, has the power to transform individuals and thereby entire
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.140]   societies.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:24.760]   Suffice it to say, our Lord knew what he was doing and what he was saying.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:31.540]   And perhaps if we were better biblicists, we would see it too.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:38.100]   To give you an example of the power of gospel transformation, I want to read to you an article
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:46.420]   by the same K. Cole James I quoted to you earlier and Jeannie Mancini, who was the president
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.440]   for March for Life.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.260]   This article was also written for the Heritage Foundation.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:32:00.060]   This was written on February 4th of 2020 and is entitled, "Remembering Pro-Life Trailblazer
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.060]   Mildred Jefferson."
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.660]   Remembering Pro-Life Trailblazer Mildred Jefferson.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.860]   She was a deeply committed Christian.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:15.700]   So imagine speaking truth and influencing what would be a Mildred Jefferson.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:28.340]   K. Cole James and Jeannie Mancini writes, "As a nation prepares to celebrate the 100th
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.260]   anniversary of the 19th Amendment and looks back on the impact of women throughout the
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:37.980]   last century, we should remember one woman who broke out not just gender barriers but
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.500]   racial barriers and influenced the course of the nation, Mildred Jefferson.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:49.980]   Dr. Jefferson was a bona fide pro-life icon, a brilliant black Harvard educated surgeon.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.220]   She helped found the nation's oldest and largest pro-life organization.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:00.540]   Her eloquent pro-life arguments and her irrepressible passion also inspired some of the biggest
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.280]   voices in the nation to speak up for the unborn.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:10.580]   In fact, in 1972, after seeing Jefferson on a national television interview, then California
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.560]   Governor Ronald Reagan credited her with his pro-life conversion.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.220]   He wrote to her, "No other issue since I've been in office has caused me to do so much
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.100]   study and soul-searching.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.900]   You made it irrefutably clear that an abortion is a taking of human life.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.460]   I'm grateful to you."
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.220]   That letter would mark the beginning of a frequent correspondence between Jefferson
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.740]   and the governor.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.780]   Reagan would go on to be one of the most unapologetically pro-life presidents in American history.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.300]   Mildred Jefferson wasn't just brilliant, she was also a trailblazer for women.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.580]   She earned her bachelor's degree in three years and was the first African-American woman
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.020]   to graduate from Harvard Medical School in 1951.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:58.300]   She also became the first female surgeon at what was then the Boston University Medical
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.780]   Center.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.500]   She was inspired to get involved in the pro-life movement when the American Medical Association
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.140]   decided it was ethical for physicians to perform abortions.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.260]   It was a decision she strongly disagreed with and felt violated the Hippocratic Oath.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   In the 1970s, as the nation was debating liberalizing abortion laws, she helped found the National
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:26.180]   Right to Life Committee, the NRLC, and later served three times as its president.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:31.020]   As president, she became one of the most visible spokespersons for the pro-life position in
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.140]   the nation.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.860]   She was a sought-after speaker and would captivate audiences everywhere, even those that disagreed
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.900]   with her.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:44.140]   As a woman and a surgeon, she had an enormous amount of credibility to talk about abortion.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.700]   As she worked to change hearts and minds, she also knew that America needed to change
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.900]   its laws.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:56.460]   In 1980, she was a driving force behind forming the NRLC PAC, one of the most successful political
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.500]   action committees in the country dedicated to helping elect pro-life candidates.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.540]   The PAC has been instrumental in stopping numerous attempts to advance abortion laws
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.540]   and in passing laws to protect the unborn and their mothers.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:17.380]   Like so many others, I, K. James, was one of those Dr. Jefferson inspired.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.060]   I first saw her speak in the late 1970s when I was sitting in the audience as a mom with
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.260]   young children.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.000]   Her talk left me awestruck and motivated me to become involved in the pro-life movement.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.380]   She was gracious enough to serve as a mentor to me in my early days in the movement.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.060]   I became the national spokesperson for the NRLC.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:41.300]   I was inspired to start a crisis pregnancy center in my hometown and to this day, I speak
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.820]   around the country in defense of the unborn.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:49.260]   Today, as president of the Heritage Foundation, advocating for pro-life laws is one of the
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.740]   things that I'm most passionate about.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:56.380]   While I, Jeannie Mancini, didn't have the blessing to know Dr. Jefferson personally,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.060]   she is an inspiration to me.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:03.340]   She swam upstream against the cultural current to fight for what is real, true, and good.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.140]   Dr. Jefferson always saw the unborn person as a patient with equal dignity.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:14.500]   She did, as I do, lead a major pro-life organization when the issue was contentious and being pro-life
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.780]   wasn't politically correct.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.580]   As we celebrate the upcoming centennial of the 19th Amendment, I am reminded that Dr.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:28.500]   Jefferson's entire life profoundly embodies our 2020 March for Life theme, "Life empowers,
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.700]   pro-life is pro-women."
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.440]   Mildred Jefferson helped the public see the cruelty and inhumanity of abortion and the
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.580]   inherent dignity of every human life.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:44.280]   She inspired a president and countless lawmakers, pro-life leaders, and everyday Americans to
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.460]   fight to save the lives of innocent children in the womb.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.180]   And at a time when the abortion proponents were winning in the courts, she was winning
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.860]   the hearts and minds of the American people.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:59.740]   Though she died in 2010, her legacy, her inspiration, and her example live on.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:05.140]   Mildred Jefferson's fight is a fight that all people must join until abortion is unthinkable
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.260]   and the law of this great land reflects the dignity of the unborn person.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:15.460]   As she so profoundly said, "The fight for the right to life is not the cause of a special
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:22.260]   few but the cause of every man, woman, and child who cares not only about his or her
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:30.500]   family, but the whole family of man."
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:38.940]   That was K. Cole James, Jeannie Mancini talking about Mildred Jefferson.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:47.180]   What a stark contrast when you take a look at the lives of Margaret Sanger and Mildred
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.580]   Jefferson.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:38:00.300]   Margaret Sanger, who was so determined to terminate and murder the lives of people that
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:11.080]   she deemed unfit, while Mildred Jefferson spent her life doing the exact opposite, fighting
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:19.660]   for those who are the most vulnerable in a time when it was politically incorrect to
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.300]   do so.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:31.260]   Mildred Jefferson was motivated by her deep Christian faith.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.260]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.980]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:41.160]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Hong out.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
