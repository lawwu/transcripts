[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Two, I would really lean into the slow productivity principle of obsessing over quality.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.100]   How do I be better?
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.760]   How do I do better work?
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.040]   How do I become the best person who is doing this anywhere?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.960]   When you obsess over quality, two things happen.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   There's two directions that it interacts with slowness.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.460]   One is just when you're trying to do something really well.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.560]   It's hard to be super busy.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.640]   It's hard to be super interleaving.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.380]   Quality demands concentration and attention, but two, quality once achieved at any non-trivial
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:44.640]   level gives you more autonomy to control your schedule going forward.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.780]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 217.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.920]   For those who are new, this is the show where I take questions and calls from my audience
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.740]   about the theory and practice of living and working deeply in an increasingly shallow
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.740]   world.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.800]   If you want to contribute your questions, there is a link in the show notes.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.420]   If you want to watch these episodes instead of listening, go to youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.180]   We have video of full episodes as well as clips of some of our more popular questions
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.180]   and segments.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.540]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined as normal by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.780]   Jesse, do you miss with Republic, the restaurant that was below us, now it's gone.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780]   It's shut down.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780]   It's gone out of business.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.560]   I kind of blame you, but not completely.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.060]   Do you miss, now that they've been gone, the weird smell Wednesdays?
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780]   No, I don't.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.700]   I don't know if it was Wednesdays or not.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.580]   That just alliterates, but we would get these weird smells.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580]   And it has to be the kitchen.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.340]   That was our best guess, but it wasn't every day.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.780]   So we weren't quite sure if they cook something weird on certain days of the week or if they're
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.680]   cleaning their grease trap or whatever.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.500]   But I just remember when you first started working here, Jesse, the first weird smell
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.060]   Wednesday, you spent a lot of time in my memory looking for, is there garbage in our studio?
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060]   Is there a corpse somewhere?
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.080]   And I had to explain like, no, no, that's just the building.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.860]   It's actually kind of funny because they went out of business right around the time we got
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.780]   our first cleaning service into the building.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.460]   So yeah, so it's possible.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.460]   It's true.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.460]   It's possible.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.540]   It was definitely the restaurant.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.700]   It's possible the cleaning service found the corpse of a raccoon that was in the closet
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   somewhere.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.500]   So maybe it's not, maybe we are casting aspersions against the restaurant that used to be there,
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   but anyways, it's nice.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.700]   So yeah, we have a nice and clean studio, no weird smells.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.420]   I think we're ready to bring, you know, respectable adults up here now.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420]   Oh, it's starting to look great.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.420]   So exciting.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420]   We'll, we'll do a video at some point.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.420]   Jesse has been helping me.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.540]   We've been renovating this room by room, piece by piece.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.660]   We've been renovating the HQ.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.660]   We'll do a video.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.660]   We'll use your, uh, yeah.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.660]   Your nice steadicam.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.660]   So, so stay tuned for that.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.500]   Check out the YouTube channel.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.460]   We got a good show today.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.580]   So we got a good segment of questions.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.420]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.600]   We have a call mixed in there.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.820]   We have a case study mixed in there.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.100]   Later in the show, I will do the books I read in September, 2022.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.260]   We should have done that last episode.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.260]   I forgot.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.260]   So we're doing a little late.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.260]   So we have that later in the show.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.420]   Uh, first, however, I wanted to do a brief segment about something I came across online
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.100]   that fascinated me.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.140]   I then ended up writing a essay about it for my newsletter at calnewport.com that went
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.860]   out last week.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.980]   And I wanted to bring it up here.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.620]   And it has to do with our favorite writer on the show, fantasy novelist, Brandon Sanderson.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.940]   I believe Jesse still gets emails from people mad that I once accidentally said that he
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.460]   wrote the name of the wind series.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.780]   So again, any complaints about that can go to Jesse at calnewport.com.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.340]   He did not write that series.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.340]   I'm not even going to try to say what the series are.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.820]   He wrote, because I don't want to get it wrong, but he's a very productive, very
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.660]   popular fantasy novelist that we've talked about before on the show.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.660]   Well, I went down a rabbit hole online about the, let's call it home office.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.220]   And as you're going to see, this is really a stretch, but the home office that he built
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.820]   a few years ago, and it's only now just finishing and only now just revealing to the world.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   So here's the setup.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.800]   And then I'm going to show some photos, but let me get this set up first.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.160]   He lives in a suburban Utah.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.000]   He doesn't reveal exactly where in Utah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.460]   It's not hard to find out because he teaches once a week at Brigham Young university, which
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.020]   is in a specific city in Utah, but we'll, we'll, we'll keep the location anonymous,
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.820]   but he lives in a standard cul-de-sac subdivision in a house he bought in 2008.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.920]   This was before he became a very successful writer because on me, I went back and looked
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.220]   this up and his debut book was 2005.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.940]   So this was early in his writing career.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.980]   So just a standard house cul-de-sac suburban Utah, the lot next to the house was empty.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.240]   So they hadn't built the house there yet.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   So he started to have an idea.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.840]   It's like, we could maybe do something cool with that one day, if, and when, you know,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.180]   I have the resources.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.080]   So the next year he had done well enough with his books to buy the lot.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.480]   So he had a house, there's an empty lot house next to the empty lot on a cul-de-sac.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.020]   So he bought the, he bought the empty lot and he hatched this plan.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.700]   He said, I want to build a home office, but because I'm a fantasy author, I don't want
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.540]   to just build a building on this lot.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.880]   I want to build it underground.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:47.100]   And he told his wife when he bought that lot in 2008 or 2009, I want a super villain layer
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.180]   underground that no one knows it's there.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.860]   And he actually followed through on this and it took him a long time to do.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.160]   It turns out it's very hard to get the permissions required to do this from any reasonable city,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.220]   but he got the permissions.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.280]   He threw enough money at it and he built this super villain underground layer.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.360]   So I'm going to show some photos here.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.780]   So if you're listening, I'll try to describe what's on the screen.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.520]   You can also see these, we'll, we'll put the clip up at the youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.420]   So the first photo I'm putting up here on the screen is the hole that they had to dig.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.940]   Now if you're looking at this, what you see is a massive hole and there's a, whatever
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.220]   that is, a skid steer at the bottom of this massive hole.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.780]   The walls there, I mean, Jesse, what would you say that's probably going from the bottom
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.980]   of the hole to the top of the wall and then the rubble on top, it's probably almost 30
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.980]   feet.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.460]   If you compare it to the guy's height, he's probably just shy of six feet.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.820]   So this thing looks massive.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.800]   Like something you would see in a giant lot.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.580]   Keep in mind, this is a one house size footprint between two houses.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.540]   So he digs this, uh, massive hole.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.660]   Then the next picture, they're building the underground layer, concrete walls, 20 foot
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.660]   high ceiling.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.620]   So what you're seeing on the screen now is the concrete bunker structure of this underground
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.620]   layer.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.820]   Now you can see the house right next door and you realize this is just in the middle
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.360]   of a suburban neighborhood, 20 feet tall, steel I-beams and concrete.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.140]   This thing is never going away by the way, 200 years from now, once we've all been exploded
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.020]   in nuclear war, this is what the, uh, the archeologists will find.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.380]   This will still be there.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.620]   All right.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.380]   And then what he did in this third picture is the after.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.320]   They built it, they covered it.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.440]   And then he's building in this scene, decoy buildings on top of it so that it doesn't
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   draw your attention.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.720]   So from what I understand, if you look in this picture, there's like a nice circular
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.180]   tile driveway that's on top of the layer.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.180]   His house, I think it's this thing you see to the right.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.620]   So you see a little bit of his house.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.260]   There's a garage they built that you'll see.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.060]   They built that on top of the layer.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.060]   So again, it's kind of a decoy.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.820]   So you're like, oh, this is, um, it's just a big driveway next to their house with a
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.820]   garage.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.460]   Uh, I can't quite figure out everything happening here.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.460]   There's these windows.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.300]   I think they're building a gazebo, but the main thing here is there it's a decoy.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.260]   So that if you now show up at Brandon Sanderson's house, it doesn't feel like there's anything
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.260]   amiss.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.920]   There's a house, they have a nice big drive and a garage and it's the next house.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.460]   Underneath this is a super villain layer.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.460]   All right.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:25.300]   So as far as I can tell from my research, and again, I'm sure, uh, my, my collaborators
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.620]   as computer scientists are happy.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.340]   I'm seeing all this time researching this.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.300]   I'm sure my editors at the New Yorker are happy.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   I'm spending so much time researching this instead of working on articles.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.620]   I'm sure my book editor is very happy that I'm researching this instead of working on
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.180]   articles, but it felt very important to me.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:45.660]   I think they finished this construction around 2019, 2020.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.700]   But only now are they finishing the actual interior design.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.260]   And we got our first look inside this super villain layer when he went on the CBS morning
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:03.220]   show, which I will say, Jesse, I have been on as well, though, in less cool circumstances,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.260]   went on the CBS morning show and brought them into the layer.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.300]   So it's not done, but he brought them into the layer.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.060]   So what I've done here is I've snagged some screenshots from that appearance.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.300]   All right.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:22.140]   So on the screen now is a very nice staircase, wide marble with red carpet, stained glass
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.740]   windows on the way down the stained glass windows turns out are his book covers.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.740]   He had them custom built.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.020]   The top of the staircase is I believe lets out into his garage.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.300]   And so there's a, there's an entrance from his house to the underground bunker, uh, nearby.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   It's nice woodwork, right?
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.300]   Jesse, look at that.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.300]   I mean, he made a lot of money.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.780]   I mean, what was his Kickstarter?
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.420]   He just did $40 million.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.420]   It was something like that.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.500]   It was like $48 million.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.220]   So, you know, he has some money.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   All right.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.860]   Next picture is, this is part of his bunker.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.620]   He likes movies.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.620]   I like movies too.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.120]   I have some friends coming over tonight of a movie club.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.620]   We watched him in my basement.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.060]   He has a screening room.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.700]   It's a full movie theater.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.620]   As you can see him in the hoster in these, uh, giant leather reclining chairs, five across
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.420]   three rows of these, there's a giant projection screen at the front.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.260]   So that's where he watches movies.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.180]   It turns out that he actually, his staff, you know, he has a company and his company
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.060]   is not headquartered out of this layer.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.740]   It has, you know, a warehouse and an office building somewhere.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.140]   Um, and he said something about they rotate through, you can sign up to rotate through
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.300]   to come watch, you know, movies here on Fridays.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.020]   And then finally I wanted to get to where is he going to write?
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.020]   He is a writer and that is the scene we're seeing here.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.460]   So it's, it's him being interviewed by the host and they're in chairs in a, uh, a wood
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.320]   paneled nook.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.700]   And he revealed later that nook is where he's going to put his desk.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.580]   So if you're watching this on YouTube, this nook wood paneled, it's beautiful work with
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.700]   books.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.420]   That's where his desk is going to be in the background.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.380]   You see a giant saltwater fish tank in this big room with black and white tiles.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.060]   That's what he calls the adventurers club.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:15.060]   And it's going to be for gatherings, like he's having people over to, um, attack goblins.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   I don't know.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.060]   I'm not good at fantasy.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   I, again, I should like fantasy.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060]   I don't.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.820]   Anyways, I thought that was cool.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.660]   Uh, Brandon Sanderson wins the work from home contest.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.140]   Anyone who has tried to build a cool space to work at home, uh, is at best second place
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.980]   compared to what Sanderson has done here.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.540]   So a couple of notes about this.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.540]   One there was some complaints.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:45.020]   I got some feedback from people that were, uh, frustrated at the amount of money.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.500]   It is extravagant that he probably spent to do this.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.800]   I believe this is probably 80% marketing slash publicity for Sanderson.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.820]   So it probably helps if you think about this as a business expense.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.460]   He's this fantasy writer, really big audience made a big push starting in the pandemic to
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.460]   have more one-on-one connection with his audience, using things like YouTube and his email newsletter.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:18.180]   He shifted away from going to conferences and trying to do digital connection with people.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.080]   Given this one to many broadcast style marketing connection to your audience, I think actually
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:31.260]   having an over the top layer like this is a good business expense because it puts him
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.460]   in the minds of his reader into this lofty position of this aspirational fantastical
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.700]   life I'm in my adventurers club writing these books.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:47.780]   And it just puts an aura of true fantasy around these books that I think will help sell them.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.460]   So it's actually probably a reasonable business expense.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.540]   I'll also give him credit.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.980]   He didn't move to a giant house.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.620]   You know, he didn't say let's move to a giant compound somewhere in the mountains of Utah.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.140]   Let's go to Park City now and have a near the ski slopes with one of these $10 million
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.140]   houses.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.140]   He's in the same house.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.140]   He bought before he had money.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.460]   He's like, let's just build this thing onto it.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.940]   So I don't know if that's good or bad, but I think it is a marketing more than anything
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.940]   else.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.940]   Interesting point.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.380]   Dan Brown did something similar.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:27.580]   Dan Brown, the author of the Da Vinci Code series, who earned, according to my paper,
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:33.900]   all the money with those books he built in Rye, New Hampshire, a house that was also
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.740]   filled with over the top fantastical elements.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.980]   You know, you press the press the button hidden on the bookshelf and the whole thing swings
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.860]   open and there's a hidden room, these type of touches.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.020]   He built a house like that as well with his money.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.100]   Again, I think there's some marketing to it.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:55.420]   Every time he does an interview surrounding one of his book launches, they come to this
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.420]   house.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   They see these cool touches.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.780]   These things matter if that's the type of book you're writing.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.420]   I'll give you another example of this from a non-fantasy, non-thriller world.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.500]   I think Anne Lamott did something similar.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.860]   So Anne Lamott, the novelist and nonfiction writer, and the fact that she wrote Bird by
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:19.920]   Bird, the sort of classic book on how to write, she moved to this really cool old property
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.860]   up in Marin County that they rescued.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.580]   Her and her husband sort of renovated over time.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.820]   It was a little bit dilapidated, grew these gardens.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.740]   It's a touch of marketing in that.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.580]   I mean, when you think about Anne Lamott, you want to think about her in this scenic
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   environment.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.220]   It's a little bit run down, but it's beautiful and she's planting flower gardens there.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.980]   It fits with her novels.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.280]   So again, sometimes there's some marketing in what writers do.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.420]   But for now, let's just leave this as what I think is a great example of working from
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.260]   your home, that's that New Yorker article I wrote back earlier in the pandemic.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:06.100]   Writers will often go to eccentric extremes in designing their workplaces to get out of
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.840]   their home, to have somewhere new to go to try to get the juices flowing.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.940]   So he's just pushed it to a new place.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.900]   So there we go.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.900]   Underground lair.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.900]   That'd be cool.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900]   That'd be claustrophobic, I think.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.900]   20 foot ceilings.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.900]   I'm just thinking all that dirt.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.900]   I'm going to die in here.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.180]   All right.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.300]   Let's take a moment to talk about a sponsor before we get to our questions from this week.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:38.340]   The first sponsor I want to talk about is 8 Sleep and in particular the 8 Sleep Pod,
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.820]   which you put like a mattress pad on top of your mattress and allows you to control the
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.500]   temperature on which you sleep.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.020]   Now, I want to forget the script for now.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.020]   Let's do some frank talk.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.140]   We have been using, Julie and I have been using the pod and I have personal experiences
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.140]   to share with you.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.460]   Don't need a script because we have been enjoying this.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.660]   Let me explain two things.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.700]   One, when it comes to hot sleeping and I'm a hot sleeper, people often think the summer
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.700]   is the problem.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   The summer is not the problem.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.580]   The summer you have air conditioning on.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.580]   It's cool.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.580]   It's dry.
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.220]   It's actually, I think the fall that is the problem.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.780]   You can have sort of humid nights.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.540]   It's a little bit too cool for the air conditioner to be on, but warmer than it would be in your
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.700]   room if the air conditioner was.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.460]   I was waking up hot, too hot under the blankets.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.700]   And so we got the 8 Sleep Pod up and running, got the app synced, got the whole thing running
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.100]   and it makes a really big difference.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.260]   It really does work.
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.740]   So the first thing I was worried about because I'm a mattress guy is will it change the feel
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.740]   of my mattress?
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740]   I have a nice Tempur-Pedic.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   It does not.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.180]   Could not feel that I had it on.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.420]   Two, I was like, okay, so what's this going to be like?
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.840]   Is it going to be like refrigerated?
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.840]   And it was not.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.780]   You feel it's a little cool, right?
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.180]   So like you, it would feel if you were just getting to the bed for the first time.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:04.260]   But what I learned about using the 8 Sleep Pod is it's not that it's really cold so much
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.420]   as it's taking the heat you generate and whisking it away.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.140]   So all of these little capillaries with the liquid inside the cover, it's taking that
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.240]   heat you're generating, whisking it away, cooling it and then bringing back.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.780]   So it's more as if it prevents your mattress from getting hot, not you're sleeping on something
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.340]   cold and I can tell you it works.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.860]   I'm now a believer.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:32.260]   This is on my king size bed in my house here in Tacoma Park.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.460]   I don't keep my phone in my room.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.700]   So we have the app is on my wife's phone and she can control it and I don't know what she
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.700]   does on there.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.660]   It also somehow figures out things like how much we're sleeping.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.340]   So I'm a believer.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.540]   If you wake up, if you get hot, this thing really does work.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.460]   I'm giving you my personal endorsement on this and they give me plenty of statistics
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.620]   here.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:01.020]   You know, they have data, 32% improvement in sleep quality, 34% more deep sleep, 19%
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.460]   increase in recovery.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.860]   I believe all that because I have lived it.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.740]   So I am now a believer in the 8 Sleep Pod.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.740]   That's a cool piece of technology.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.380]   So go to 8sleep.com/deep to save $150 on the pod.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.540]   8 Sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada and the UK as well as select countries in
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.740]   the EU and Australia.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.640]   That's 8 Sleep, spell it out, E-I-G-H-T sleep.com/deep.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.620]   Do that /deep to save $150.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:42.220]   I also want to talk about a new sponsor of the show, which is Roan.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:48.260]   This again is a no brainer because long before they came to us about potentially being a
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.580]   sponsor, I have been using and wearing Roan clothing.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.620]   Jesse, you have seen me I'm sure before when I'm not in my official Deep Question shirt.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.180]   I'm often wearing the Roan shirts with the little red X's.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.220]   I'm particularly fond of a few things, but I'll often wear their, I don't know what you
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.300]   call it, but the sort of athletic wear t-shirt, which is like a very nice, it's what I wear
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.780]   in the summer around here in DC, looks nice, comfortable, moisture wick.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:25.060]   And what I'm excited about is they also have now clothes that you can wear in nicer situations.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.220]   We're talking dress shirts, we're talking dress pants.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:36.140]   So for example, their commuter shirt is comfortable, breathable and flexible.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.820]   Also it doesn't wrinkle.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.460]   I have a white one and it's great.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.440]   So it has like a flex to it.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.860]   It's not going to be wrinkly.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.480]   It's very lightweight.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.540]   It's not going to wrinkle, but it looks, it looks really good.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.580]   You could wear it with a blazer on, you can wear it, you know, by itself with a, with
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.260]   a pair of shorts in the summer.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.700]   I'm really enjoying the commuter, the commuter shirt.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.820]   They also have pants again, flexible, breathable, lightweight.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.780]   You feel like if you needed to, you could pull a Tom Cruise mission impossible and jump
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.180]   off a building, but they look great.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.420]   So you can be around with them all day, be active, but still, it looks great when you
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.980]   have to go to the event at your kid's school as well.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.020]   So there's some tech here.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.460]   So if we actually want to get specific about it, it's four way stretch fabric.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.660]   They have wrinkle release technology.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.360]   They use gold fusion anti-odor technology.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.060]   So you'll be smelling fresh if you've been active all day long.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:43.140]   Anyways, I am a fan of Roan from my, my casual clothes, the commuter shirts I've been wearing
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.140]   it.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.520]   So I'm glad I'm glad that we actually get a chance to promote them.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.320]   So the commuter shirt in particular can get you through any workday and straight into
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   wherever comes next.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:03.940]   So if you head to Roan.com/Cal and use the promo code Cal, you can get 20% off your entire
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.940]   order.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940]   That is a really good deal.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:15.060]   So 20% off your entire order when you head to R H O N E.com/Cal and use the code Cal,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.980]   it's time to find your corner office comfort.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980]   That's great.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.420]   Jesse, we're starting to get sponsors of things that I have.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.820]   I have long used.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   Cool.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.300]   Now we just, we have to get a, there's a podcast blue shirt.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.780]   It's funny if there's just like a company.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.780]   Roan will make one.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.540]   Roan, Roan needs to make me, it's like the, the, the deep questions like Cal branded.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.460]   Actually their commuter shirt would be great for podcasting.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.460]   So good for them.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.540]   So I'm thinking about other things I used that we need, we need to sponsor us now.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.780]   How about the generic white coffee cup?
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.780]   This gets used a lot.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.780]   Are you tired?
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.780]   Moving my eye.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:03.340]   Are you tired of burning yourself as you try to hold hot coffee in your hands to bring
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.820]   it to your mouth?
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.480]   We have a solution.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:13.020]   White cup, put the coffee in the cup instead of in your hands and you get 98% less burns.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.020]   All right.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.180]   Enough of that nonsense.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.020]   Let's do some questions.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.940]   Actually be useful here.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.940]   So what do we got?
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   What's our first question, Jesse?
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.940]   All right.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.580]   The first question is from Julian.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.780]   Julian says, I intend in university for a brief period to get a degree in film, but
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.780]   dropped out.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.060]   I want to be a screenwriter, but I currently work in the service industry.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.660]   So my days can be long and tiresome.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.980]   At 20 years old, I feel incredibly behind in my writing.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.340]   Was dropping out of university a bad decision?
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:50.660]   Well, Julian, first of all, I think dropping out or not dropping out, this is a red herring
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.940]   when it comes to the specific question of screenwriting and jumpstarting your screenwriting
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940]   career.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   I think there's a lot to be discussed about dropping out of college, whether you should
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:06.260]   or shouldn't, but I don't think it really matters either way, good or bad when it comes
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.900]   to this very specific question of are you behind in your screenwriting career and what
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.400]   would you need to do?
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.780]   So I'm not a screenwriter myself.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.140]   I don't have a specific background in it.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.500]   I am a big fan of movies.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.180]   I am a big fan of the movie industry.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.180]   I know screenwriters.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.740]   I'm going to try to pull together from stuff I have learned to try to offer you some advice
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.740]   here.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.180]   I have two things to recommend Julian.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.180]   One surround yourself by other artists.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.020]   This is critical in the movie industry, particular if you're going to be a screenwriter, you
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:48.400]   have to be around other people with high artistic aspirations in this field.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.660]   If you're trying to do this in isolation, how do I write a movie that gets made?
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.580]   You're going to produce things that are formulaic.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.800]   You're not going to find traction.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.980]   You have to aim incredibly high and be around people who are really pushing themselves.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.260]   You see this again and again when you look back through the personal stories in particular
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.300]   of directors or director writers that really break out.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.780]   They're surrounded by other aspirational film industry types.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.780]   They're pushing each other.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.740]   They're learning from each other.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.860]   They have big aims.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:26.260]   I'm just reading right now a Francis Ford Coppola biography and about that generation
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.580]   of filmmakers.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:32.060]   They came from various places, but they were all with each other.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.500]   So he had George Lucas.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.900]   He was very close with George Lucas.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.660]   And then that crew met up with the USC crew.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.620]   So you had Scorsese, you had Brian De Palma.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:50.740]   And they connected with Spielberg, who didn't get into USC, but also had a deal with Universal
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.220]   at 19, so it didn't really matter.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.780]   So you had Spielberg, you had De Palma, you had Scorsese, you had Coppola, you had Lucas.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:03.180]   They're all hanging out and pushing each other and working with each other.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   And out of that came really interesting work.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.420]   JJ Abrams has a sort of interesting similar story.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.220]   So surround yourself by other artists, people who are obsessed with this.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:21.200]   I just went down a PTA rabbit hole, Paul Thomas Anderson rabbit hole, same thing.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.500]   You see him at Sundance Labs as a really young filmmaker, just surrounded by all of this
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   talent.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   So surround yourself by talent.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.620]   If you're not, it's not going to work.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.900]   Then when you write, aim really high.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:40.180]   Because the other thing I picked up, even with screenwriters that you associate later
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.740]   on with this seems like a commercial blockbuster movie.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.700]   So if we're thinking, I'm thinking JJ Abrams, maybe go back and think about John
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.260]   Milius.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:55.020]   They were artistically really ambitious and they were working on and they would work on
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:02.860]   scripts that were really stretches, novelistic, literary, interesting, nuance of character
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.180]   and pacing.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.000]   Your produced works are going to fall below where you're aiming.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.420]   So if you come into the industry thinking like, how do I write an action movie?
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.420]   Like one I just saw, like a Marvel movie or something, you're going to fall below that
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.420]   standard and do nothing.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.380]   But when you come into the industry with interesting artistic stuff, you show real skill.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.260]   That is what is going to develop your skill.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.540]   That's what's going to catch attention.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.020]   Even if the things you end up getting produced later are farther down the ladder.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   Now, 50% of what I'm saying here, Julian, might be nonsense.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.620]   Again, I'm not in the movie industry.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:42.300]   I did though have an interesting conversation once with the head of story at Paramount.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:47.500]   So it was someone who doesn't write scripts, but helps develop all the scripts that Paramount
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.940]   is actually going to work on.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.260]   I learned a lot from that conversation, but basically you have to be, if you're going
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:58.020]   to succeed in screenwriting, people have to see you as having this spark, this artistic
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.980]   genius.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   And then they're happy to have someone with an artistic genius, you know, write, take
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.960]   a hack at the next Guardian of the Galaxy franchise.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.980]   But you got to, you have to come in with this spark.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.100]   So aim really high, be very aspirational, very ambitious, surround yourself with other
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.100]   artists.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.100]   That's what matters.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.240]   Whether you dropped out of college or not, it doesn't matter for that specific thing.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.600]   So that'd be my advice.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.480]   How would you suggest that Julian balances it with his service industry job?
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:29.180]   Like say, say he works some nights, he might work some doubles, stuff like that.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.000]   I mean, go back and read a bunch of Tarantino oral histories.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   That's a good one.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.380]   I mean, I've seen early interviews with Tarantino, find out about how he was crafting his scripts
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.580]   when working at the famous, what was it?
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.220]   The video, what was it called?
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.260]   You said the video store, but that way I don't remember the exact name of the video store.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.500]   I think that's a good example.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.040]   Kevin Smith is another good example of people who were honing this skill while just working
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   in a service industry.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.500]   Tarantino is where I'm going to point you actually, Julian, if you really want to see
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.900]   what I'm talking about in action, because he was obsessed with film, obsessed with it,
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.020]   watching everything, tracking down where the weird prints were.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:16.300]   This art house across town is playing, you know, some early Kurosawa there.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.060]   You know, Oh, I want to see, you know, Hitchcock's rope, which is not really widely played, but
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.920]   there's maybe an interesting print happening over here.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.900]   He was obsessed with film and that obsession with film drove it.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   He had a service industry job.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.220]   He was working at a video store doing other odd jobs.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.620]   And that's when he also started writing.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.180]   By the way, look at Tarantino's rise.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:43.420]   He did a lot of script work early on with some pretty major blockbuster type films.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.220]   I'm blanking on what some of the names are now, but films you would remember from the
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.440]   early, the mid nineties films that were just straight up like Nicolas Cage action films,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   he would call it.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.360]   And he would have a passion to work on those things, which again shows that the writers
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.400]   who work are artistically ambitious, even if not everything they work on itself is artistically
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   ambitious.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.840]   So use Tarantino, I think is a good case study.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.880]   You're 20, you have energy.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:16.040]   So if you get obsessed and let that obsession drive you, you can, you have the time, you
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   have the time.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   All right.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.120]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.300]   All right.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.360]   Next question is from the alchemist.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.120]   He's an actuary in his thirties.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.960]   He says, in a world without email, you make a case for processes.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.920]   Is there a preferred method or tool for where you or how you store, update or communicate
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   these processes?
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.020]   I mean, my answer is kind of yes, dot, dot, dot.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.360]   So what I mean is you should have a preferred tool.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.940]   I don't care what it is.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:54.880]   So the tool you use to keep track of and promulgate the details of the processes you use on your
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.280]   team or in your organization, the processes you use to try to get away from the hyperactive
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.200]   hive mind where everyone just rocks and roll on email or slack or teams, they do need to
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   be somewhere.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.960]   Everyone needs to understand where they are.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.120]   They need to be able to find them.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.360]   There needs to be some process for how they're reviewed and for their updated.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:16.280]   The details of how you do that, I could care less about.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.460]   This is one of these situations where technology is not going to save us.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.800]   We have to figure out the right processes and then go find a technology to use to actually
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.040]   work with those processes.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   So you could have a Google doc somewhere.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.540]   You could have drop boxes with sub folders for the different processes and text files
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.880]   in each that describe them.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.200]   You could chisel it on stone.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.600]   It could be laminated and posted up on the office wall.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.720]   I mean, I don't really care how you do it so long as it's clear and everyone understands.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.560]   What I am going to recommend though, and I think this is very important, is no matter
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:57.480]   how you store the processes your team or organization uses, you have to have a meta process or on
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   a regular basis.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.000]   And I think at least once a month, everyone who is involved with one of these processes,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.340]   so everyone who it affects, I have to actually now follow some of these rules, needs to review
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.120]   and say, is this working or not?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.640]   And if it's not working, how can we fix it?
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.420]   And if it's out of date, we don't really need this anymore.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.200]   This never really worked or we needed it back last January when we were crunching on this
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   client, we don't need anymore.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.160]   You get rid of it.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:33.220]   Now that's really important because dead weight processes weigh down everything else.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.840]   So if your team puts together, here's seven different processes we use for collaboration.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.280]   This keeps us out of our inbox.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   It's great.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.800]   If two of them don't really work very well or don't really need to still be there, but
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.840]   they're sticking around and people feel like they have to go through the motions that will
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.060]   put friction on the entire idea of using processes.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.420]   In this example, those two deadweight processes could bring down the other five.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.960]   It could bring down the whole idea that we follow processes.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.360]   That friction makes the whole gears of processes begin to seize up and people just fall back
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.440]   to hyperactive hive mind.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.840]   I'm not going to go through, I have to upload this and this seems like a waste of time.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   This seems like busy work.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.040]   This seems like bureaucracy.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.880]   I'm just going to hit you up on Slack.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.200]   So more important than where you store the processes is making sure that you update them,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.560]   that everyone is involved in what works, what doesn't, what do we have to, what do we have
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560]   to get rid of?
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.040]   Because there is a fine line between a well-structured collaboration environment and stress inducing
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   bureaucracy.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.880]   So the latter is terrible.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.120]   That's poison for morale.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.480]   The former can be great.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   The line is fine.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.200]   So you have to be careful about that.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   See here.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Oh, it looks like we have a call coming up.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   I like calls.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   All right.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   Let's see what we got here.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   We have a call from Robert about slow productivity.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.920]   Hi, Cal.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   My name is Robert from Nova Scotia, Canada, and I'm a process improvement consultant.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   And I've been thinking a lot lately about your scales of productivity, including your
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.680]   most recent interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.300]   And in my role, I'm stuck between balancing slow productivity and bill blockers.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:17.840]   So my measure for productivity is billable hours, but it does seem very short term focused.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.200]   I know in the long term, I can be more productive by doing activities such as building a better
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.680]   sales engine, creating better training programs, basically all of these other elements of being
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:34.240]   so good that our team can't be ignored that are associated with bill blockers.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.120]   So currently, this has led to extra work in the evenings and weekends, which seems counterproductive
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.960]   to slow productivity.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.080]   So do you have any recommendations for slow productivity for workers that are measured
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   by billable hours?
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   Thank you.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.520]   That's a good question, Robert.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.960]   First of all, just I want to comment on the audio of your recording.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.040]   It sounds like in your effort to work from near home, you are working and recording your
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   question from within a inside a large metal buoy.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.240]   I don't know, Jesse, what you think it does sound like he's in a Sanderson's lair.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.960]   Maybe he's in Sanderson's lair before they put in the walls.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.360]   Or he's trapped in a metal box somewhere.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.920]   No, it is a good question.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.480]   Billable hours throws an interesting wrench into discussions of slow productivity.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.260]   I do have a few thoughts, a few thoughts about it.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.520]   So I'm going to suggest two things.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:35.960]   One, start billing yourself for hours put aside for long term projects, projects that's
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.240]   going to make your team more effective in the long term.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   Have a goal.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:46.800]   I'm spending two hours a day, three days a week working on sales engine, working on,
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.280]   you know, updating the technology we use for this particular process that we're often consulting
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:56.000]   on and keep track of those hours and report them.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.280]   So when your boss says, okay, Robert, what was your billable hours this quarter?
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.080]   You say, well, I built this many, this client, this maybe that client, this many hours were
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.480]   billed to this longterm improvement project, which I think is going to make us more profitable
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.760]   in the longterm by having specific numbers.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.400]   The only feedback you can really get from your boss is like, hey, that's good.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.300]   Or B, maybe you should not do that improvement or let's do less hours, but you have a particular
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.880]   number to kind of deal with.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.000]   You're quantifying this work that otherwise wouldn't be quantified.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.440]   You'll want to quantify it because now once it's quantified, they can understand, oh,
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.960]   your total number of hours you're working is a good amount.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.800]   And I see that 20% of those hours were going towards longterm improvements.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.480]   So I'm okay that the other billable hours were reduced by a little bit because I see
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.900]   where your time is going.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.640]   If you don't keep track of these non-client focused activities, then you do have to end
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.780]   up doing them at night or on the weekend or in the morning, because otherwise it would
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.000]   just look like to the outside observer that your total amount of work has shrunk.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.800]   You got to capture why that work shrunk.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:05.520]   Two, I would really lean into the slow productivity principle of obsessing over quality.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.720]   How do I be better?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.380]   How do I do better work?
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.640]   How do I become the best person who is doing this anywhere?
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.560]   When you obsess over quality, two things happen.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.160]   There's two directions that it interacts with slowness.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   One is just when you're trying to do something really well, it's hard to be super busy.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.240]   It's hard to be super interleaving.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:31.960]   Quality demands concentration and attention, but two, quality once achieved at any non-trivial
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.360]   level gives you more autonomy to control your schedule going forward.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:41.000]   So as you get better at what you do, as you find specialties within your field that you
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.600]   become world-class at, you will gain more flexibility.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.300]   You can bill higher hours.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.720]   You can start doing less total hours because you're still generating the same amount of
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   work.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.560]   So I would say obsessing over quality, that principle three of slow productivity is something
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.480]   that you really want to keep in mind there.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   All right.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.000]   So keep track of what you're doing for the non-actual billable hours and treat them like
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   they are billable and two, obsess over quality.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.640]   And three, I would say if you need help getting out of that giant metal buoy floating out
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.760]   there in the Nova Scotia Bay, let us know because I don't know if that's the most productive
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.360]   place to actually be doing your work.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.600]   Jesse, as someone who, because we've had to, I mean, you weren't here when I was first
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.200]   setting up the studio, but like obsessing over echoes and sound is a big part of setting
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.520]   up podcasting studios.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.600]   So I think for audio engineers everywhere, it gives them hives.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   I agree.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   The live space.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.880]   I have a lot more respect for sound quality now than I did prior.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.440]   I mean, speaking of rabbit holes, very impressed by anyone who's good at sound.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.920]   We need a sound person to let's put out the bat signal.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   I don't know if we're going to catch, catch you in the middle of an episode.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.720]   If you're in the DC area and a very good sound engineer, let Jesse know.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.080]   So if you heard that last recording and, and thought it sounded good, then don't contact
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   us.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.360]   Otherwise we're always in the market for a good sound person.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   All right.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.080]   What do we got next?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.800]   Next question is from Paul.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.200]   He's a software developer from Zambia.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.000]   What are great hobbies to have outside of work that will aid in our focus levels during
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.840]   our deep work sessions?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.200]   Well, Paul, when it comes to becoming better at concentration, so training your ability
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.880]   to concentrate, which readers of my book, deep work, no, is something that I find to
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   be important.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.560]   This idea that concentration is something you have to train.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.200]   It is a skill you develop, not a habit that you just need to do more of.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.480]   So once you decide you want to train your ability to concentrate, I typically divide
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:51.800]   relevant training activities in the two categories, passive and active.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.160]   So the passive activities when it comes to concentration typically have to do with becoming
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.000]   more comfortable with boredom.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.540]   And by boredom in this context, I mean lack of novel stimuli.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:10.020]   So if you're going to try to concentrate deeply on a hard problem, that effort by definition
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.680]   is going to be boring.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.000]   If we use the official definition of boredom, meaning a sort of uncomfortable lack of novel
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.200]   stimuli because you're doing the same thing hour after hour.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.900]   So if your brain is uncomfortable with that, if most of the time when you're not working
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.960]   on something hard, you're pulling out your phone at the slightest hint of boredom.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960]   I'm in line.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.880]   I'm in a red light with my car.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.280]   I'm waiting for someone to come back from the bathroom at a restaurant.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.800]   If at every hint of boredom, you're exposing yourself to hyper palatable digital distraction,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.000]   your brain will create a Pavlovian connection.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.320]   Distraction follows boredom.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.320]   Distraction follows boredom.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.360]   And once it has that connection made, it's not going to tolerate three hours trying to
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.080]   work on a book chapter, two and a half hours working out a complicated business strategy
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.700]   because it will say we don't have stimuli.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.760]   We always get stimuli when we lack it.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   Where's the phone?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Where's the phone?
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   Where's the phone?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   And no matter what your intention is, no matter how much you told yourself, it's very important
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.680]   that I concentrate now.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   I read deep work.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.580]   I know I will produce at a higher level if I don't switch my context, no matter how much
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.020]   you pep yourself up.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.680]   If the last three or four years you've trained your brain, boredom, distraction, boredom,
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.080]   distraction, it's not going to put up with it.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   You'll be very uncomfortable.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.960]   You're not going to be able to concentrate well.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:34.280]   So passive training activities for concentration are just things that get you used to not giving
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.760]   in to boredom.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.560]   And almost any hobby you come up with has this capability.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.140]   I like films.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.560]   You know, I have a film watching group with some buddies of mine watching movies.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.440]   Believe it or not is great passive training.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.320]   Put your phone away, put your tablet away.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.400]   You have to just follow the movie that's happening on screen, reading books, going multiple chapters
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   without taking out your phone, without looking at a tablet.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.960]   That is great passive training.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.480]   Anything outside is as well.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.080]   Basically any sport, you're playing pickup basketball, you're focused on the basketball.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.560]   You're going for a long walk or a hike without a phone with you, without an earbud in your
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.800]   ear, you're getting that passive training.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.200]   So you want a lot of that in your life.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.080]   You want on a regular basis to be doing things with your full attention without looking at
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.160]   a phone, without looking at a screen.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.400]   So almost any hobby will get you there.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.520]   Just be sure whatever hobby you do, you keep purified in a distraction context.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.320]   So no screens while you do that hobby.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.540]   All right.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:41.400]   Active training is where you actually practice maintaining your focus on something difficult.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:49.240]   So you can actively increase your capacity for focus by doing that very activity.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:55.740]   So if we're going to connect this back to hobbies, any hobby that requires really unbroken
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:01.360]   concentration to succeed is going to actually help you get this training with concentration.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.440]   That most commonplace you're going to get this is actually training.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.000]   So it's maybe not the application of the hobby.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.600]   Like once you know how to do it, it's when you're trying to increase your skill at that
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.160]   hobby.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.400]   So I don't know if you're playing pickup basketball, you might be in a flow state.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   I'm just playing.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   I'm just trying to be loose.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.760]   And that's not actually a state of I'm really pushing my ability to concentrate.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.120]   But when you're practicing, you're practicing, like I'm trying to get a jump shot that works
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.720]   and you're thinking so hard about, okay, what's my arm angle?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   What am I doing?
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.280]   It's that deliberate practice zone of trying to increase your skill.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.160]   That's actually where you get a lot of the improvement.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   Chess is another example.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.720]   Playing the game of chess.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   Yes, you do have to concentrate.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.560]   You're trying to read the board and what's going on.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   What are the moves?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   That's good training.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.120]   The practice for the games, though, if you're a serious chess player, you're going to be
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.160]   doing puzzles with your coach, with your trainer, where they're setting up scenarios where you
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.300]   have to try to solve it that are just past where you're comfortable.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.680]   That's even better training because every single thing you're doing is at the limits
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   of your comfort.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.280]   In the chess game, maybe that's only true of 20% of the positions.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.840]   So any hobby that has you concentrating really intensely in a way that if your concentration
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:22.200]   wavers, your success reduces is going to get you more comfortable with concentration as
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   an activity.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   So do those two things.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.320]   I'm comfortable with boredom and I'm used to the feeling of concentration.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.680]   I've practiced that.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.600]   That will translate.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.920]   And now when you're doing the cognitively demanding professional task, you're writing
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.960]   the code because you're a software developer, Paul, so that makes sense.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.680]   You're writing the code or whatever.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.080]   You're going to lock in longer.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.540]   You can have more intensity.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.840]   You can hold more of the variables in your working memory.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.480]   You can play around with the algorithm designs.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.440]   And so, yeah, hobbies can really help if you know what you're trying to achieve.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.960]   All right, so I want to try a case study next.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:05.480]   I'm trying to work more of these in where we actually have people reporting back on
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.240]   various successes or failures with the ideas we talk about on this show.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:17.720]   So the case study I want to share today comes from Bryce, a 28 year old living in North
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   Carolina.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.600]   All right, so let me read what Bryce sent me and then we'll talk about it.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:29.120]   I started house hacking right at the beginning of the pandemic to lower expenses and have
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.040]   more financial flexibility.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.340]   Now I'm on my third house plus guest house in two years.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:42.680]   This allows me to live what I currently consider to be the ideal work schedule and deep life.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.400]   Here is my current daily work schedule.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.200]   He puts work in quotation marks.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.280]   First I consult part time for a health care startup.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.480]   Long term career goal is to fix U.S. health care.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   I do that in the morning.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.660]   Next, I listen to podcasts during lunch.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.880]   Then I train for power lifting or go out to walk on non lifting days.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.520]   This is the afternoon.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.200]   Occasionally meetings or networking calls on non lifting days as well.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.480]   I watch a show during dinner.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:18.720]   I read a physical book or go to a meetup or work on an upcoming speech when relevant.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.200]   I listen to audio books or podcasts until I go to sleep at 930.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:31.300]   All right, so that was Bryce explaining his current deep life.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.580]   Let me just define a few things here.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.780]   He's talking about house hacking.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.720]   You might not have heard of house hacking before.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.820]   That's the concept where you buy a house as a primary residence.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.300]   You can get a very low mortgage rate.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:50.860]   And then you rent out part of that house and the renting of that house then pays for the
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   rest.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.460]   So maybe you buy a duplex and you live in the one half of the duplex.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.540]   You rent out the other half of the duplex.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:05.720]   The rent from the other half of the duplex covers the mortgage payments and insurance
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.740]   or what have you on the whole building.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.460]   Now you're living for free.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.860]   So not only are you living for free, but you're building up equity in this property as well.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.180]   So eventually you're also going to own this property outright.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.540]   So when he says he's on his third house plus guest house, I think he's property laddered
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.940]   up to bigger properties where he can rent more of it.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.820]   He may be, he's renting out multiple houses.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820]   That's not house hacking.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.340]   So I'm a little bit confused, but basically he's using real estate in a way to keep his
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   expenses very low.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.900]   So if you're young, like he is, if you're 28, you don't have a family and you're house
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.980]   hacking, you might have zero living costs while building up equity in a house, which
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.620]   means you can live pretty cheap because you don't have to pay for your house.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:50.480]   So it looks like he's doing part-time consulting, but part-time consulting is giving him more
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.260]   than enough money to live on because again, he has no housing expense.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.620]   And so that's a, it's an interesting lifestyle that he's designed there.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.660]   Why I like this is because it is a great example of lifestyle centric career planning, going
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.980]   to an extreme place.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.620]   So when we talk about the deep life, one of the tools that we commonly discuss on this
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.260]   show is lifestyle centric career planning, where you start with a vision of what you
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.660]   want your life to be like in the medium term future.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.840]   And then you work backwards from that to try to figure out how you engineer it.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.680]   What Bryce did here is when he was fixing that image, he had an image of a life, at
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.400]   least for his later twenties, before he had a family or whatever else he wants to do.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:38.440]   He clearly had an image that was very autonomous, very focused on as a young adult, sort of
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.480]   coming into his potential, establishing himself as an adult.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   He wanted a life where he was reading and he was exercising and he had a lot of flexibility
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.000]   and he was getting exposed to ideas and getting sleep.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.200]   I think it's very aspirational for someone who's in their twenties to think about.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.980]   It's a pretty good thing to do.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.180]   And once he worked backwards from that, he says, well, how do I get this?
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.320]   How do I get this much flexibility?
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.760]   And here's the magic of lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.000]   When you work backwards from the lifestyle instead of forward from career options that
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.240]   seem available to you, you can land on some pretty radical solutions.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.580]   And that's what happened here.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:16.680]   So probably working backwards from that vision, he was thinking, well, to have this much autonomy,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:21.800]   you know, the exercise and the long evenings with friends and all the reading, that's
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.480]   going to be hard if I'm working till five or six every night.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.280]   So how can I, how can I cut down my work hours?
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.720]   He's probably doing the math and well, I have some background in health care.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.040]   It turns out if he elaborates the story, I think he has a pharmacy degree or a background
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   in pharmacy.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.760]   It's probably thinking, well, I could probably do consulting, but that's not going to be
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.040]   enough money to live on.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.200]   I'm going to be living super frugally, so that might not be great.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.600]   And then that's what probably brought him to house hacking.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.960]   You know, if I could get rid of my living expenses, though, now these numbers track
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.200]   and this kind of makes sense.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.960]   And then if I'm building equity in my house, let's say I want to start a family in my early
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   thirties.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.540]   By then I might own this house that I've been living in for free, and then I could turn
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.560]   around and sell that house.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.520]   And with that money that could really get me started with setting up a new home for
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.680]   my family.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.920]   You don't end up in these interesting, unusual configurations.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.360]   If you go from your current situation forward, hey, what job's available to me, how would
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   that work?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.320]   You only get there when you work from a lifestyle backwards.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.920]   So that's what I like about Bryce.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.320]   Not that his particular path is some sort of model that we should all do or that is
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:34.360]   available to everyone, but that his approach can lead to really interesting places.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.640]   So I think that's interesting.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.500]   So good for you, Bryce.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.000]   Working from a lifestyle, you can end up in interesting places.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   This reminds me, Jesse, of we were talking about quiet quitting in a recent episode.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.040]   And one of the things I pointed out is my one frustration on behalf of the quiet quitters
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.440]   or those who are having this discussion is that they're missing how much of an existing
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.060]   conversation there is out there already about what to do when you feel burnt out or stuck
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   in your work life.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   And so this is another example.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.960]   You do lifestyle centered career planning, you end up somewhere interesting, you get
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.800]   there with intention, you feel autonomy, you feel control.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.360]   There's just so many more levers available to people in crafting their life than simply
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.520]   have to have a job.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.640]   And I'm kind of upset at my job.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.240]   And so I guess I'll just not do as much of my job and wait for capitalism to be overthrown.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.880]   This is all these really interesting ideas out there.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.280]   Lifestyle design, the Tim Ferriss lifestyle centric career planning, what we talk about,
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.520]   the financial independence people.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.760]   They're under fire.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.360]   The financial, the fire community, you know, we talk about them sometimes.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.080]   Ironically, the fire community.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:51.480]   So this is the financial independence retire early community is under fire themselves.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.640]   So I think the media in particular has decided that fire is bad and there's now like a pretty
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.080]   consistent drumbeat against that movement.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.240]   So if you don't know fire, I mean, it is a relatively narrow movement, but it was basically
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.320]   largely came out of people who were young and in the tech sector because salaries were
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.080]   high in the tech sectors and they worked the math and say, if you have a high tech sector
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:20.000]   salary because it's a high salary, if you work, live really cheaply, you can actually
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.440]   save up a huge amount of money because you started a pretty high salary early on in tech.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.560]   And if you're living really cheaply and saving most of your salary in about 10 years, you
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:34.300]   can actually save enough money where you can continue to live equally cheaply just off
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.960]   of your investment returns.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.820]   People in the tech industry also figured out there's a lot more freelancing or consulting
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   opportunities.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:46.440]   So, so you can live cheaply, quit the full-time job, do some consulting, live off the money
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.600]   you spent and you have a lot more flexibility.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.320]   That was the fire movement.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.520]   The fire movement is under fire right now.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:58.840]   The sense is I think is the, the general media response is that they're not sufficiently
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.960]   on board with other things they care about.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:07.240]   So there was a, an article in the Washington post last week, for example, about Vicki Robbins,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.480]   who wrote your money or your life, which was this book from the seventies.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.080]   It was the, the Bible of sorts that fire used in the two thousands and building up their
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   movement.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.040]   It's a sort of throwy and argument about your life is worth money.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.280]   Ours your life is worth value.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.440]   So how much of that you want to give away for this much income.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.360]   And it's really a beginning of this idea of getting financial independence early came
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   from that book.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.480]   But the whole point of this article was well, she and us are very disappointed in the fire
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:43.480]   movement because they don't talk enough about various political issues they think are important.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   So it's interesting.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.880]   So, so the fire movements being discarded for not sufficiently engaging in discussions
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.640]   of economic inequality or other political issues.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:58.720]   You know, my friends, the frugal woods who are in the fire community, I talked about
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:04.760]   them in digital minimalism, Liz won't talk about fire anymore, even though that's their
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   whole thing.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.720]   They left Cambridge, Massachusetts, the move up to Vermont to a homestead, and they, they
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.800]   live very cheaply, saved a lot of money and use that.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.640]   So they could, they could have a lifestyle on a homestead and not have to work as much.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.400]   I think it's actually pretty cool what they're doing up there.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.320]   She has announced recently, I'm not going to talk about fire anymore.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.040]   You know, all I'm going to do is maybe get personal finance advice to people who write
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.400]   in because she couldn't take the negative feedback.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:36.880]   The tide turned against fire and she started doing these long disclaimers about like, here's
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:42.200]   the 17 different ways, you know, I'm privileged and, and the, and people still get mad at
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   her.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   I just don't think she could take it.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.920]   And she's like, I'm just not gonna talk about this anymore.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.600]   So anyways, fire is under fire, but I think it's interesting as a case study of the broader
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.520]   goal of lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.320]   When you work backwards from what you want your lifestyle to be like, lots of different
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.560]   options can show up.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.580]   And so you could end up like the frugal woods on a, they're in a homestead in Vermont.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.240]   She was freelance writing.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.760]   Nate was doing computer programming remotely and then was able to stop that.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.200]   So they're basically living off of, they kept their house in Cambridge and they rented out
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.320]   and she makes some freelance money and they live cheap and they live in the woods.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.360]   It's kind of cool.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.360]   That's an option.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.440]   You could end up like Bryce house hacking, you know, I don't have housing expenses.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.000]   So I can do part-time work and have a lot of other free time.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   That's an option.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.160]   Or it could be something completely different.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.800]   It could be like me or where to me, it's not so much that I want to have very small work
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.400]   hours, but I wanted to be able to write and do intellectual work and have some flexibility
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.720]   in my schedule and spent my entire adult life trying to craft exactly what I'm doing right
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.720]   now.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.760]   So I'm kind of rambling here, but let me just bring this in for a landing lifestyle centric
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:54.280]   career design, working backwards from the lifestyle to your decisions in the near future
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:59.320]   leads to a lot more interesting opportunities than just saying what's available to me right
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.400]   now.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.600]   What's a reasonable of those things, what, which is the things I'm going to do.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.440]   So that's how we should think about fire.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.800]   Just like house hacking, just like anything else.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.560]   It's one geo arbitrage living, working remotely while living somewhere cheaper.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.320]   So now you don't need as big of a salary because where you live is cheaper, but you like the
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   environment more.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:23.160]   So a lot of these are just tools in the big toolbox of stepping back, taking deep breath,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.240]   getting excited about a vision for your life and figuring out what do I need to take out
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.640]   of here and apply to actually get there.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.200]   Mr. Money Mustache has said I wasn't a special on Netflix.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   Oh yeah?
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.720]   Someone sent me a Mr. Money Mustache thing recently.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.680]   Yeah, that's not.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   That's interesting.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   So did you see the special?
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   What's the show?
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.920]   It's like a, they follow several different people.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:55.880]   Mr. Money Mustache advises one couple about lowering expenses and stuff like that.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   I like him.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   I like him too.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.880]   He was in one of your books.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   He blurbed digital minimalism.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.560]   And then you talked about him in another book, right?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.560]   I think maybe I talked about him in a world without email.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.760]   Um, but I talked about digital minimalism.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.040]   He blurbed it.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.160]   My story, my Mr. Money Mustache stories that he told me the way he, the way he read digital
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:19.280]   minimalism, I sent them, you know, sent them the book to read the blurb is he went to a
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.000]   tree and he read it under a tree because he wanted to be away from all distractions while
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   he read it.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.480]   And I was like, you get the prize for the coolest way to read this book.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.200]   Mr. Money Mustache sitting under a tree.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   He's a cool guy.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   He's an interesting story as well.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.480]   Um, again, it's, he had a clear vision for what he wanted his life with his son, what
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.760]   they wanted it to be like.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.440]   And he's very intentional about how it works.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.960]   Now he's an interesting situation because he lives cheaply.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   They had this all figured out.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:55.840]   And then him writing about what he was doing suddenly became incredibly lucrative.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.720]   So then he had this fire hose of money, which was not part of the plan.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:05.960]   And to his credit, he just didn't change his lifestyle at all because of the money that
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.520]   that Mr. Money Mustache website was producing.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.520]   He would give a huge amount of it away to charity.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.400]   So he's doing six figure charitable donations.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.920]   And then he bought some real estate, which I thought was cool in downtown Longmont and
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.800]   renovated it and build a, like a coworking space.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.360]   So like people could come and work and they have events there where people come and give
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   talks about this.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.400]   And I mean, it's a little bro-y because he, but he's a bro-y guy.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.760]   I mean, he's literally a bro.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.800]   He's a big guy.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.880]   He likes to lift weights.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   He welds.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.880]   Really handy.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.880]   He's very handy.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.880]   He builds a ton.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.360]   He builds a weight racks there and squat racks and stuff like this.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:45.200]   And I know that's one of the attacks on some of these people is what the bro-y, but like,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   yeah, this guy is a literally a bro in the sense that he's like a, you know, Burt Reynolds
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.520]   type character, but he built a very intentional life.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:01.280]   And he didn't spend the money on, you know, buying big houses or this or that.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   All that stuff's interesting.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.640]   I sort of feel a synthesis coming for a lot of these ideas.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.560]   Maybe not for me, but there's a whole generation that's like, oh, so how does this work thing
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.560]   work?
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.960]   And there's so much interesting ideas.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.520]   Maybe we just need a good umbrella to put over the whole thing.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.960]   And I just, I have, I'm a lot, I'm excited for the potential for all these people out
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   here right now.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:23.080]   They're thinking, I don't know, I don't really like this job and I'm on zoom and what is
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.960]   work and, uh, like all that sort of youth anxiety.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.880]   There's more options now than there's ever been before for how to like really rethink
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.880]   work.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   So it's exciting.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   All right.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.320]   So let's, uh, see, we've been a couple more questions here before we get to my books.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   What do we got next?
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.840]   Uh, next question is from Jeannie.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.600]   She's from Singapore.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:49.200]   In episode one 65, you said you would give an update on your experience with Zettelkasten.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   How are things going?
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   All right.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.960]   Well, I'm, I'm not really doing much Zettelkasten.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.840]   I failed at that experiment.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.400]   I'll tell you where I might need it so I can put out the bat signal to the Zettelkasten
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.360]   experts out there if they want to respond.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.640]   So where I have systems that work just fine is books.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.520]   I'm writing articles.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.320]   I'm writing stuff I'm committed to.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.960]   They each just get their own project in Scrivener.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.920]   Scrivener has great tools for organizing research and notes.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   And I want them.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.720]   That's where I want the research and notes because when I actually writing that book
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.600]   chapter or writing that article, I want all of the relevant research right there.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.000]   So my thoughts, my notes, all of that goes in the Scrivener once I'm actually working
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.440]   on a writing project.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.720]   Same thing for academic writing for computer science work.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:44.080]   I'll start a latex document for a paper I'm writing, even if it's very early stages.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:50.480]   And I'll, I use a online tool called Overleaf, which is just a browser based editor that
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.140]   all your collaborators can edit the same file.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.000]   So we used to whatever, I don't want to get too technical.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.280]   We used to use code based version management software to keep track of files when we're
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.080]   writing papers together because we're nerds.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.560]   And now there's cool tools like Overleaf.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   It's all web based.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.400]   But anyways, I'm early in a paper.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.840]   I'm going to start a document and everything's going to go in there and it's going to get
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   huge.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.520]   And then eventually I'm going to pull out of there, you know, what we'll actually submit
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   for publication.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.080]   So all that's fine.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:27.920]   The place that's weakest in my note universe is ideas that I'm not really working on yet.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.260]   Random ideas, thoughts for things I might want to do.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.260]   Even just interesting information like this could be useful for a book one day.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.160]   This could be useful in an article one day.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:42.780]   From what I understand that that universe of, we can think of it as like non-instrumental
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:49.040]   note capture is where Zettelkasten type ideas might come into play.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.660]   I am capturing a lot of this in Obsidian, which is a markup based note taking software
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:59.460]   that's very compatible with Zettelkasten style philosophies, but I'm not doing it well.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.240]   It feels disorganized or forced.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.600]   So I'm just not there yet.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.060]   So, Jeannie, I'm not there yet, but I do need help.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:10.200]   I don't think I'm quite capturing non-instrumental notes properly yet.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.240]   So again, I will give you another update if I advance that particular area.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.040]   Some of your notes carry over in your moleskin, right?
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   From month to month.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.060]   So my moleskin captures typically lifestyle design related questions.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:34.000]   So things about my life, my vision, examples that are aspirational to me.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.880]   But things are supposed to move out of there when I check it every month into more permanent
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880]   systems.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   And sometimes it happens in a very obvious way.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.160]   It's like, great, I'm now going to put this into my strategic plan.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.760]   I'm now going to update my values document.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.520]   My strategic plan for work has this long-term vision for what's going on with my academic
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.420]   work and I'm going to update that vision.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.760]   So sometimes it's obvious and sometimes it's not.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.360]   It's just an idea and I don't know what to do with it.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   Got it.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.280]   And it'll sit in there for, yeah, it may languish in there for a while.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.720]   So that's the piece I need to get better.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.180]   I like Obsidian as a tool.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.880]   My methodology is not great though.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.760]   All right, let's do one more question.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.640]   All right.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   Nature's call.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.040]   I'm a PhD candidate in humanities and your system has helped me enormously in creating
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.760]   structure for myself.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.240]   The main thing getting in my way is my IBS.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.920]   I have good days and bad days, but on bad days I find my deep work sessions frequently
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.880]   interrupted by trips to the bathroom.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.200]   I'd love your tips for realistically mitigating these issues.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:42.520]   So I did a little IBS or irritable bowel syndrome research and I was looking up list of famously
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:50.120]   productive people who have had digestive ailments, some sort of variety probably of IBS.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:56.480]   And some of the names I found, for example, were Tyra Banks, the actress Sybil Shepard,
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.920]   the musician Kurt Cobain, former president JFK and onwards and onwards.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.880]   And the reason why I'm pulling out these names is to underscore a point here that I think
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   is important.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:15.880]   And this is a point that comes up often in discussions of slow productivity, which is
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.800]   if you're returning to something that's important to you with intention again and again to the
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.280]   best of your ability in the situation.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.960]   So some days are better than others.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:35.380]   When you zoom out to the scale of many months or years, you can have a highly productive
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.880]   impact on the world.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.120]   Cobain, JFK, Shepard, Banks, huge amount of productive output into the world, stuff they
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.240]   find very important.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.080]   So at that scale, the scale that matters, you can be producing things that you're proud
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:55.360]   of, even if on the scale of days and weeks, you have wildly varying abilities to actually
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   do things.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.720]   Even if I could do very little today or this week has been a bad week, even if that's happening
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.480]   to that scale, if you keep coming back to things with intention, the good days or the
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.640]   small progress on the bad days adds up the things that are really important.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.840]   So there's this shift of scale I think is important, this shift of timeline from days
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.280]   and weeks to instead months and years is going to take some pressure off of you and your
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   self-evaluations.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.360]   JFK had terrible days.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.680]   He had Addison's, IBS issue, all sorts of issues.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.900]   He had days where he was immobilized in the White House, immobilized in constant pain.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.840]   But if you look over the period of the whole first year, you see he did things that were
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   important.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   FDR was similar.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:49.800]   It was an IBS with FDR, obviously it was the issues with his polio and how difficult that
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.400]   made things.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:56.640]   Very bad days, bad weeks, some days could do more than others, but you zoom out and
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.960]   you say, "Ah, you helped win World War II."
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.040]   So I think that scale shift is really important so that you're not so down, you won't be
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.200]   too down on yourself during the temporary bad periods.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.280]   To give a contemporary, let's say relevant example from the headlines is Hilary Mandel
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:24.960]   died recently, the acclaimed historical fiction writer, she wrote Wolf Hall among other books.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.440]   She had huge chronic issues.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.840]   I don't know exactly what they were with pain and other types of things, very difficult
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.160]   sort of day to day.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.320]   She would have days where she could do nothing, but she wrote these books that when you zoom
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:41.560]   out, reader obituaries, when you zoom out, incredibly influential.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.800]   She was acclaimed for the work she did.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.880]   So to me, I think that's very important, shifting scales, especially when the reality of your
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.560]   life is one where every day is not going to be a banger.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:56.960]   All right, let me give some practical advice now, once we've done that bigger picture shift.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.120]   One, simplify your professional life.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.640]   So simplify your obligations.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.000]   For a humanities PhD student, to the extent possible, just be focusing on your dissertation.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.520]   You might be able to get out of other types of things that other PhD students might be
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   doing.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:18.680]   Simplify, that's fine, because what you want the ability here is relatively flexible days.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.720]   Mainly what I'm doing until this afternoon is just working on my dissertation and I'm
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.880]   flexible on that.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.560]   And so like some days I get less work done than others, but it's flexible.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.440]   It's just what I'm doing each day is doing as much work as I can or feel comfortable
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   doing.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.240]   I have enough time to do it, not this highly pressured.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.520]   I have one hour here, two hours here.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.680]   I have all these other things going that I'm falling behind on.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.040]   So give yourself flexibility.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.840]   You have an issue that is real and hard and other people don't have it and you have to
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.720]   acknowledge that and give yourself a bit of a break.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:52.400]   It's okay for you, for example, to have a lighter load than the other person who started
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.640]   in your program who doesn't have the same chronic medical issue.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:05.040]   But to not to get graphic, but in your elaboration, you did talk about you.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.920]   One of the ways the frequent bathroom trips become a problem is that you bring your phone
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:17.240]   with you and you mindlessly scroll and now you are out of the whatever cognitive context
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.240]   you were in before when you're working on your dissertation and it really can derail
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.340]   you.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.120]   So the simple answer there is bring books into the bathroom.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:35.040]   My grandfather, very well established theologian and scholar, brilliant professor, former provost,
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.920]   et cetera, et cetera, was famous for this.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.200]   I remember his students telling these stories at his funeral that he would come up to them
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.920]   and say, oh, I found the perfect chapter for your dissertation.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.080]   I was just reading about this.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.600]   This is going to be perfect for you.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.520]   And what they always would notice is many of his bookmarks were toilet paper.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.440]   So work can be done in many different environments.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.360]   Let's just leave it at that.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.560]   Practical advice piece number three.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.400]   I think this is relevant for anyone who has some sort of issue going on that is high impact.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.840]   It could be chronic health.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.200]   It could be mental health.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.160]   It could be a traumatic life event.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.860]   Someone close to you died, et cetera.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.600]   Or you're going through even like a difficult situation with your job or a difficult situation
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.560]   with a friend and there's a relationship breaking, whatever.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.000]   There's something nontrivially difficult happening in your life.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.600]   This is a good time to really focus on all of the deep life buckets.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.040]   To feel like you're giving each of them attention, that you care about it.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   There's keystones, you've overhauled them.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.500]   The reason why you want to focus on all of the deep life buckets when times get unusually
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:51.040]   hard is because it gives you a, a sense of control and b, it de-centers, if you allow
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.200]   me to use a more trendy term coming out of a postmodern critical theory, it de-centers
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:01.360]   work in your perception of your day to day existence.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.040]   Work which falls under the craft bucket is one of the many things that are important
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.480]   to your life that you're doing what you can, given the difficulties of your situation.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.480]   That mindset will make you less stressed about, yeah, I'm not crushing it with my dissertation.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.580]   I'm not writing all the book reviews that my fellow grad students are.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.440]   That becomes less ominous.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.680]   That becomes less stressful when you're like, well, I have my craft and I have my constitution
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.520]   and I have my contemplation on my community.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.880]   I'm working on all these things and trying to keep a foothold in each during this hard
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.760]   time and I feel intention and I feel some sense of control.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.480]   And maybe I'm in an emergency backup mode in a lot of these because I'm have a, there's
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.880]   a big issue going on right now, but I know what's important.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.240]   There's lots of things in my life are important.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240]   It's not just work.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.160]   Work is just one of the things that I'm working on and trying to keep alive.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.440]   You can get through hard periods with much more calm and confidence than if you've centered
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.920]   work is this is all that matters.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.940]   And so if I'm losing time from work, this is a crisis.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:04.980]   So paradoxically focusing on more will help you feel better when you have time to do only
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.980]   less.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.200]   So one of these interesting paradoxes of productivity.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.080]   All right.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.440]   So there's my advice and good luck with that.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.280]   I, again, though, I would just say replace the toilet paper bookmark before, before you
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.440]   bring the book, before you bring the book into school.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   That's my only, that's my only one piece of advice.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.200]   All right.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:33.160]   So what I want to get to soon is the books I read in September every month.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.620]   I like to talk about the books I read in the month before.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.620]   So that's coming up next.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:42.480]   Let me first just mention one of our sponsors that makes this show possible.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.680]   And that is our good friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.360]   Privacy matters.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.120]   Most of us think privacy is important.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.640]   And we would like to believe that when we are browsing the internet, we have privacy.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.220]   Unless someone's looking over our shoulder, we'd like to believe the fact that I'm going
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.320]   to calnewport.com or whatever, the fact that I'm looking up celebrities with IBS, that's
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.680]   my business and no one else's.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.000]   Well you have a lot less that privacy than you might hope.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.480]   Did you know, for example, that major internet providers will keep track of what sites you're
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.160]   visiting and they will sell that information, for example, to advertisers, to people who
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.320]   are trying to mine your data.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   Doesn't sit well with me.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.000]   I probably shouldn't sit well with you also.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.440]   So what do you do to try to get away from this type of mining of your behavior and your
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   data?
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   You use a VPN.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.200]   A VPN is like a digital middle finger to data miners.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.200]   Here is how it works.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.720]   I've explained this before, so I'll be very brief.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.040]   Instead of just directly connecting to let's say calnewport.com, you instead if you use
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.880]   a VPN are going to connect to a VPN server.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.000]   And it's an encrypted secure connection.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.200]   So all your internet provider knows is that you're connecting to a VPN server.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.000]   They don't know what you're telling that server.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.400]   Then you will be sending that server an encrypted message that says, I want to go to calnewport.com.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.240]   And the VPN will say, are you sure about this?
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.240]   Because I mean, come on, you're like, I know, I know, but I still want to see calnewport.com.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240]   All right.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.560]   And then it goes to calnewport.com on your behalf, gets the information from the site,
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.480]   then sends it back to you encrypted.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.840]   All your provider knows is you're going somewhere through a VPN.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.280]   They have no idea where you're going.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.680]   They have no idea who you're talking to.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.000]   There is no data for them to scrape and sell.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.160]   I love that feeling every time I'm using a VPN of knowing that Verizon can't keep track
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.360]   of what I'm up to.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.640]   So if you're going to use a VPN, you should use the one I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.000]   They have, in my opinion, the best selection of servers.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.040]   So no matter where you are in the world, there's probably going to be a server not that far
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.560]   away for you to connect to.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.000]   Being nearby is important because the latency is lower.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.640]   They also have great bandwidth.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.080]   The connection is very fast.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.720]   Yeah, you're going through a VPN to talk to calnewport.com.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.520]   But you don't even realize this because you have these blazing fast connections.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.680]   And their software is great.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.280]   You put on all your devices, click a button to turn it on.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.840]   You're just using all of your normal internet browsing apps and tools like you normally
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840]   would.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   But now it's going through a VPN.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.200]   So you need to use a VPN.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.040]   And if you do use ExpressVPN, and I can get you a discount, this is the good news.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:34.360]   So if you visit ExpressVPN.com/deep, you will get three extra months for free.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.680]   That's e x p r e s s vpn.com/deep.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.680]   Go to ExpressVPN.com/deep to learn more and get those three months for free.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.080]   I also want to talk briefly about life insurance.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.800]   Alright, here's the thing.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.760]   If you have a family, if you're married, if you have kids, you have a partner you've been
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.800]   living with a long time, you need life insurance, you know this, you're probably stressed about
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.920]   it because you don't have it and it seems like a pain.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.360]   So right now, I want you right now you're going to pause this podcast and go get life
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360]   insurance.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.240]   You can do that and be back to this podcast with barely missing a beat.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.800]   If you use PolicyGenius.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.800]   PolicyGenius was built to modernize the life insurance industry.

[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.320]   AIG and Prudential in just a few clicks to find your lowest price.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.040]   Like my life insurance is AIG.

[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.840]   $500,000 of coverage.

[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.320]   They're not incentivized to recommend one insurer over another.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.400]   They really are trying to just get you the best possible deal.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.260]   So if you don't have life insurance, pause this, pause this, go to PolicyGenius.com.

[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840]   All right.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:48.520]   So as promised, I want to go over the books I read in September.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:54.280]   As long time listeners know, my goal is to read five books a month and I then review
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   them on the show.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.200]   So let me go through in the order that I finished them.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.520]   The five books I listened to or read in September 2022.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.560]   It's kind of a weird list this month, Jesse.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.360]   I was looking at this.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   I'm all over the place.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.360]   I'm excited.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   All right.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.960]   Number one, I might need your help on number one, Jesse, because I might, I'm mixing up
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   this author's name in my head.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:23.880]   So it's the book Endure, the memoir Endure by Cameron, is it Haynes or Hayes?
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.360]   The Bowhunter Extraordinaire.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360]   Haynes.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   Haynes.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   H-A-Y-N-E-S?
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.360]   H-A-N-E-S.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   Cameron Haynes.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.520]   Anyways, I don't know why I stumbled across this, but Cameron Haynes is-
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.480]   Probably Joe Rogan.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   He is on Rogan a lot.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.180]   He's on a lot of shows a lot.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.560]   So probably when he was doing publicity for this book, I caught him on some show I listened
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.560]   to.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:55.400]   Interesting guy, got very into bow hunting and I guess revolutionized the sport because
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.280]   he brought to it extreme physical fitness.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.260]   So he realized if you're incredible shape, so sort of ultra endurance athlete shape,
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.160]   you run marathons a couple of times a week to train type shape, you would be more successful.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.600]   Bowhunter, because often you're in the back country hiking up and down mountains, they
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.080]   have to pack these things, hundreds of pounds of meat out of the mountains on their backs.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.360]   And so he trains like a fanatic year round and then goes on these bow hunting trips in
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.220]   the season.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.960]   But he, I guess, catalogs a lot of his training.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.840]   And so he's been inspiring for a lot of people as part of the sort of discipline culture
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.640]   that's out there, the internet discipline culture.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:44.160]   David Goggins, Jocko Willink, Rich Roll was a part of that world, now Cameron Haynes.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.480]   So people who do really, really intense training.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.360]   The book was okay.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.440]   I would say my main complaint is I wanted to learn a lot more about the mechanics of
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.320]   bow hunting.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.280]   Like this is very, how does it work?
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.200]   Like what makes a successful bow hunter not, I wanted many more tales of, of, you know,
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   actual hunts.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.880]   I wanted to be brought into that world maybe a little bit more, but it was interesting
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   just to hear about this guy rebuilding his life.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:17.400]   And it's a similar story to Rich Roll, troubles with alcohol, trouble with his family.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.240]   And he, he turned it all around on discipline.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:27.160]   The main thing I'll say about that entire subculture, that discipline internet subculture,
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.560]   it gets maligned and I don't think it should be.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.760]   It gets maligned because people say these are, it's broey or these guys are like supermen
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:42.480]   and weird, unattainable ways, but I'm pretty sure the service that the figures in that
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.160]   internet subculture serve is not.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.680]   You need to be like me or you're a failure.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.760]   It actually, I do believe is very inspiring for a lot of men that they need to be in general,
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.920]   more disciplined in their life.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.340]   And that leads to lots of good things and their relationships and their ability to show
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:03.080]   up as a husband, as a father and their ability to succeed and be a leader in work.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.400]   It introduces the idea of discipline.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.600]   This is what I've gotten away from it is not that people are going to become marathon
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.760]   running bow hunters, but that they might stop drinking and exercising every day and, you
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.760]   know, spending more time with their son at their baseball game.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.560]   So I think there's a lot of good, way more good than bad coming from the discipline subculture.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.360]   What were his workouts like?
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.080]   He does crazy stuff, man.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.200]   Like he'll just casually run marathons just to train.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.080]   Like I just, I ran a marathon today to train and then the next day he does super endurance
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.000]   events to a hundred milers, 150 milers.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.600]   How old is he?
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.120]   He's a little older than us.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.440]   I think he's like mid forties.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.440]   Might be wrong.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   His kids are older.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.640]   I think he's mid forties, maybe late forties.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.520]   I might be wrong about that.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.000]   But as a guy, as a beast, he has this, he's famous.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   So, okay.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.360]   So he said in the book that the reason he got on Joe Rogan's podcast for the first time
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.920]   was he saw a video of him.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:10.480]   One of his training things he did was just, there's this mountain where he lives in Wyoming
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.320]   or not Wyoming, I think Washington state.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.120]   And he would pick up this giant rock and he's like, I'm just going to go to the top of the
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.120]   mountain with this rock.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.040]   And then, and then he brings the rock back down.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.040]   Like that was his train.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:27.840]   He's like, I'm going to hold this giant, uncomfortable rock and carry it to the top of the mountain.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.840]   There we go.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.840]   Cameron Haynes.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840]   All right.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.640]   My second book is from someone who is in slightly less good shape, I would say, then Cameron
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.200]   Haynes, at least physically.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:44.600]   And that is great movies by Roger Ebert, the late great Roger Ebert.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.080]   Ebert's a, I'm a huge Ebert fan.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.080]   You know, he won a Pulitzer.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:54.640]   There's not a lot of Pulitzers that have been given out for movie reviews and he has one
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.960]   of the only ones, maybe the only one, I don't know.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.320]   I don't know if Pauline Kael ever got a Pulitzer.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.320]   That's a good question.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.520]   Well, anyways, he has a Pulitzer and movie reviews, a great movie reviewer died in the
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.520]   two thousands at some point, he had throat cancer, tragic.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:16.260]   But at some point later in his career, he convinced the Chicago Tribune to allow him
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:21.720]   to write these every other week essays where he went back and wrote essays on what he considered
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.760]   to be just great movies from past.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.240]   Instead of just reviews of new movies coming out, can I go back and look at great movies
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   from past?
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.720]   Can I write an essay on taxi driver?
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.880]   Can I write an essay on Casablanca or some like it hot?
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.160]   And then he collected them in this book.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.840]   So it's just a hundred movies, a hundred essays.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.120]   And it's part of my efforts.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.760]   I'm trying to more formally pursue an understanding of film.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.760]   I like films a lot, but I've been self-educating at a higher level recently.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.760]   And this was just part of that effort.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:54.200]   I was like, I should probably just read a hundred essays by a great movie reviewer on
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.840]   a hundred great movies and just suck in that information like a sponge.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:57.840]   So I enjoyed that.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.840]   It's a great writer.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.400]   It was a great introduction to a lot of these movies.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.000]   And so I learned a lot.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.120]   And what I've been doing is when I watch movies now, my method is I'll watch the movie and
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.360]   then usually about a half hour into the movie, I'll stop and then go rabbit hole, reading
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.480]   everything I can on that movie and then return and finish watching the movie with all that
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   information in my head.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.960]   So I get to experience the movie fresh and then read a ton of stuff and then watch the
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.320]   rest of the movie.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.080]   And one of the, it's my insider tip.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.520]   One of the coolest places I've found when rabbit holing on movies, they get really interesting
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:37.960]   information is cinematographer magazines and forums.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   You go to see cinematographers will write off in these incredibly detailed articles,
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.400]   for example, like American cinematographer magazine, where they'll write these long articles
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.240]   on how that particular movie was shot.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.560]   And it's fascinating.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.360]   And there's these discussion boards where you can learn so much about how movies are
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   made.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:04.160]   This is my, my secret weapon for rapidly building up a sort of cinema appreciation.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:09.740]   It's like my oldest and I were watching the second hunger games movie because he's reading
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.240]   that series and he likes them.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.760]   And it's too scary for the young kids.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.280]   We're watching the second one.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.320]   And then I went back and found an article that was being written by, it was the, no,
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   it was in a forum.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.320]   It wasn't even an article.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.320]   It's in a cinematographer forum.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.920]   It was the lead cameraman from that movie.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.920]   And you've learned so much because he's just getting into it.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.840]   He's like, and then when we went to this set, we were using this and this type of lens.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.680]   And this is the issue we were having with the lighting and the smoke.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.680]   And everyone was asking him questions.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.000]   And then at some point, the cinematographer, who's actually a quite famous cinematographer,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   joined the discussion.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.240]   And now the cinematographer is in there and they're getting into it back and forth about
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.500]   the different choices they made and the lenses.
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.280]   And you learned all these really interesting things.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:55.160]   Like I didn't realize this, but with the hunger games second movie, they were filming anamorphic
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.960]   on 35 millimeter up until the halfway point when Katniss goes up the tube into the arena,
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.320]   the hunger games arena, they switched to IMAX and they kept the same aspect ratio, but with
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.920]   this huge level of detail, oh no, they expanded the aspect ratio.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.800]   In the movie theater, they actually expand the picture expands on the screen.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.200]   Anyways, cinematographer forums, you find a lot about movies.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.480]   Did you find any other good movies from that book?
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:28.200]   Um, I mean, they're the classics, but I've been, I found I can get through about a movie
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   a week.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.720]   If I, it takes me about three sessions and I use some combination.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:39.520]   So what I'm doing now is at least once a week I try to schedule a lunchtime viewing, right?
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.360]   When I get a sandwich from the butcher shop in town and just for an hour or so, just the
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.320]   middle of the day, the kids are at school.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   Just watch.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   And that's great.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.680]   Just watch a movie for an hour.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.400]   I can usually get, if I'm very careful about it, if it's, it's my wife and I switched back
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.840]   and forth bedtime duty.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.720]   So if it's a night where it's her turn, if I'm really careful about getting all the other
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.960]   chores done, I can get an hour in, you know, because I can kind of start early and then,
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.800]   you know, while she's doing bedtime.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.000]   And so usually in like three sessions I can, I can get through, get through a movie.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   So I've gone through a lot.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.640]   What I went through a bit of a Coppola seventies, any movies in that book that you have on your
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.800]   list that you didn't know about?
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   There's ones I didn't know about.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:30.200]   I don't know if, yeah, he, there's definitely some, a lot of foreign films, a lot of yeah.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.720]   Interesting films you want to know about, but he's trying to draw your attention to,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.520]   I might watch, there's a good famous, um, Warner Hertzog movie he talks about and a
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.480]   gear, the wrath of God.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.960]   That's about conquista doors in central America.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.480]   And it's a classic Hertzog, you know, everyone almost died during the filming there in the
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   jungle.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.120]   Uh, and like, I'm going to, that's on my list now.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.100]   I never would have known about that, uh, without, without reading him.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:01.080]   Also it's a really good introduction to the French and Italian new wave directors.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.360]   Cause he'll just say like, here's the five movies to watch.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:12.200]   So you don't have to fall too far into a mess of Godard and Fellini and trying to understand,
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.080]   you know, um, Bergman, like, what should I be watching?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.280]   So I guess you say Swedish as well as French and Italian.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.240]   And he's like, just watch this one, this one, this one, just here's one, you know, from
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.360]   each, you should be watching, you know, eight and a half and seven seal.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.440]   And it just shows you like, just watch these.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.440]   Uh, I learned about, I didn't really know a lot about the blow up Michelangelo Antonio's
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.200]   the blow up, but I learned about it.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.960]   And then I watched Francis Ford Coppola as the conversation, which was very inspired
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   by it.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.780]   So the blow up is a, it involves a photographer who's trying to reconstruct us potential murder
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.600]   that he was captured on film.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.120]   So he's like working with the film and it's ambiguous.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.560]   And the conversation, it's a potential murder plot captured on audio and Hackman is playing
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.560]   with the audio.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.520]   Uh, and I listened to the director's commentary for that one too.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.400]   Anyways, look, I'm nerding out.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.880]   Sorry about that, but it's one of my hobbies right now is, is, uh, cinephilia.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.600]   And so that's why I read that book.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.600]   That's how I'm doing it.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.680]   All right, let's speed up book.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.440]   Number three, the metaverse by Matthew ball.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.480]   I just needed to read this and I write about technology for the New Yorker.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.960]   I need to know about these things.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   The metaverse is it's, it's a buzzy book written by a real booster of the idea of the metaverse.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.100]   He's trying to explain sort of where we are, why it's inevitable.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:30.240]   The thing I like the best about this book is he gets into the tech specs.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.480]   He really, and I learned a lot about this, you know, here is the specs on like the latency
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.920]   and how much of a fast internet connection you would need to have a persistent 3d world.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.360]   Here's actually the difficulties with having a hundred thousand people in the same simulation.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   We can't do that right now.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.160]   You understand how much servers this would require.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.480]   Uh, you know, so it gets into the weeds on all the different technical aspects of having
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.040]   something like the ready player one oasis where these large 3d persistent worlds for
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040]   everyone participate.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.920]   So actually I like that the best about the metaverse.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.320]   You don't see that enough in these tech books.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.000]   Like let's get into the weeds with information.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   All right.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.480]   Number four, genius makers by Cade Metz, C A D E. Metz, the genius makers is on the
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.600]   rise of deep learning artificial intelligence.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.800]   So it sort of tells the stories of the main figures.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.720]   You got, uh, you know, Gregory Hinton, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.440]   I've done this as a hobby, deep mind.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.320]   I needed that for an article I'm writing.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.560]   Can't tell much more about it now because it's in progress, but it's good.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.560]   It's accessible.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.200]   So you can learn a lot about the recent rise of artificial intelligence and what's driving
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   that.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.840]   Number five, here's the weird one, Jesse.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:50.960]   And then there were none by Agatha Christie, one of her original, I don't know what you
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.240]   call these mysteries or cozy mysteries.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.640]   I listened to it on tape.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.640]   Well, Julie listened to it first.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:56.640]   I was like, Oh, you'll love this.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.480]   So then I listened to it on tape as well.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   And it's great.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.440]   It, I mean, it was written in the thirties, but it's very modern in its pacing.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   And it's, it's what a great high concept it's, you know, 10 people show up at this island
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:16.240]   and, um, they die one by one and they're like, okay, what's going on here.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.480]   What's and, and then the people are trying to figure out like what's happening.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.800]   Is there someone else on the Island?
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.600]   They're dying one by one by one by one.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.880]   Uh, and it's not a spoiler because of the title, then they all die.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.520]   And then there's an epilogue where the whole thing is explained.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520]   Fantastic.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.520]   What happened?
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.760]   I'm not going to say, read it, read the book.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.000]   Uh, I recommend it.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   It's fun.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.440]   And audio it's like six hours.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.880]   It's not, it's not even that long.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.080]   I did not figure it out, but I'm terrible at figuring things out, but it is very cleverly
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.280]   constructed like at the end you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   Okay.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.560]   So it's like a round of applause and a tip of the cap.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.200]   I love that type of writing.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200]   All right.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:01.880]   Well, speaking of round of applause and tipping caps, we should probably wrap this one up.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.040]   So I thank you everyone who submitted your questions.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.200]   If you want to join the show, go to the survey link in the show notes and you can submit
