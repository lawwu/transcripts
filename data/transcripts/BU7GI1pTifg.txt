[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   The topic I want to tackle in today's deep dive is the art of no.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:21.320]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 213.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.160]   On this show, I answer questions from my audience about the theory and practice
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.680]   of living and working deeply in an increasingly shallow world.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.160]   If you want to submit your own questions or case studies, there is a link
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.280]   in the show notes for this episode, or you can go to calnewport.com/podcast.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.800]   Video of the full episodes, as well as highlighted clips, is available
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.680]   at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.680]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.720]   Jesse, it's good to see you.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.200]   Good to see you, too.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.680]   I got to say, in the last week, I have fully transitioned back
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.080]   after my summer relaxed approach.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.840]   I was going to say hiatus, but let's say my summer relaxed
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.880]   approached the organization.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.240]   I am back now, among other things, into my full daily planning
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.840]   habit routines, the sort of middle of the school year, hardcore
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760]   Cal Newport planning everyday routines.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.720]   It takes me about a week or two to get back into it, but I'm back into it.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.560]   I use my time block planner.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   First thing in the morning, I go in and check my weekly plan.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.280]   I look at my calendar, sort of figure out what am I working on today?
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880]   Sketch out my initial plan.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.680]   I do a shutdown complete at the end of my workday where I'm processing
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.680]   any tasks that have been captured in the planner throughout the day.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.360]   I bring it then back upstairs.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760]   So it's upstairs in my room.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.880]   I bring it downstairs to my study, do that initial planning.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.440]   It comes back up to my room because then at the end of the night,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.960]   when I'm getting ready for bed, all the relevant metrics for the day
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.240]   go in the metric planning space.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.680]   When I'm at full throttle, that's all the things I'm doing.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   And I'm back to it after a summer of, you know, I always pull back
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.480]   a little bit in the summer because I have like seven jobs.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.280]   And it's pretty intense to keep it all running.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   And so I pull back when I can.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.320]   But now I'm back to it. I feel good.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.760]   Do you still have morning writing blocks every morning?
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   Yeah, every morning.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.520]   Well, six days a week.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.960]   The plan is six days a week.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.520]   I'm writing in the morning.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   That's still rolling.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   Some mornings I can write a lot.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.960]   Some mornings I can't write as much.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.640]   This morning I got in 75 minutes.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.480]   That's on the short side.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   But it was 75 good minutes.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.240]   I was writing about Georgia O'Keeffe.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   That's cool.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680]   In case you're wondering.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.640]   You know, given my career in writing,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.280]   I sort of have an ear for story that highlights interesting points.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.440]   And Georgia O'Keeffe has a really interesting story.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.320]   This is my slow productivity book I'm writing about seasonality,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.560]   having different seasons throughout the year where you do
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.640]   different times with your work.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.960]   And I wrote about how through the first eight years of her adult life,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.880]   starting when she was 21, job after job, after job all over the place.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.920]   She would be in Texas teaching and then TAing back in New York
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   in the summers and taking some courses, then teaching in South Carolina,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   like all over the place.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.520]   Her art was developing, but really slow.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.080]   She had a period in there of four years where she'd even pick up a paintbrush.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.480]   Then she meets Alfred Stiglitz, the famous photographer who runs
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   it was running this famous gallery in Manhattan that was showing
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.360]   a lot of the early modernist.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.280]   And he saw her work and exhibited it.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   They became friends.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   And he's like, you got to come out to my family's property near Lake George.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.800]   So Stiglitz's dad in 1880 had bought 36 acres
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   right north of Lake George Village on the western shore of Lake George.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.040]   And so she leaves the bustle of the city, goes up there.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   They lived a little farmhouse on the property.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.040]   And in doing that, it like unlocks all of her all of her productivity.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.440]   I mean, for the next however many years it was probably 1918 to 1934.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.520]   She's just writing, painting every summer, doing studies of the lake,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.640]   studies of the mountains, studies of the barn, studies of the flowers,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.880]   studies of the leaves.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.720]   This is the stuff she starts exhibiting in the 1920s in Manhattan.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   It's what makes her name is what makes her famous.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.240]   It's the most prolific period of her career.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.720]   And it's because she changed what she did during that part of the year.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.840]   So, you know, that's the type of thing I'm working on.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   That's cool.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.000]   So I'm back into it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.440]   But back to my planner.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.240]   So anyways, the thing I was thinking about this morning is every summer,
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.160]   when I come back to full-time block planning at the end of the summer,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.920]   I, it's, I struggle.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.000]   There's always resistance.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.280]   And the, the, the point this brought up for me is there is a real mismatch.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.760]   I'm guessing there's a real mismatch between our brains and the type of
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.040]   planning and motivation that they're wired to do and the complexity of the
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.560]   highly artificial type of organization we have to do for modern complicated
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.600]   knowledge, work, family existences.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.800]   So the, the brain, my brain, when it thinks about, wait a second, we have to
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.000]   pull out this planner every morning.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.720]   We have to stop.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.800]   We have to take five minutes.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.040]   We have to write down our plan for the day and we have to record metrics in there.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   We have to follow the plan.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   This seems like constraint.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.200]   It seems like energy that's being spent without an immediate reward.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.800]   It seems like options being taken away.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.560]   There's this resistance to doing it because the part of the brain, the
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.680]   motivational center that gets you going to do something does not understand.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.280]   This structure over the course of a month is going to two X the amount of
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.240]   valuable knowledge product that we produce.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.400]   It does not understand that.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.600]   So it just generates resistance because it's confused by it.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.320]   So I feel that resistance every time.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.640]   However, once you've done it for a while, the brain is pretty adaptable.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.200]   And it's like, oh, this is part of our routine.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.080]   Something good is happening.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.280]   There's a structure to our days.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   We feel good about it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.200]   And then it's easy to keep going.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.160]   So there's some sort of interesting science of habit formation going on here.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.360]   But every, at the end of every summer resistance at first to get all the
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.120]   systems up and running, give it two weeks and the brain's like, yes, what we do, man.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.800]   We didn't have our planner.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   We weren't doing the things like we'd be all adrift.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.960]   And so I don't know.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.560]   There's an interesting commentary in there about what it takes to get our brain on
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.720]   our side for doing things that our brain doesn't really know much about in
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.360]   terms of evolutionary instinct.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.840]   That's my brainstorm.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.800]   All right.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.480]   So how's our, uh, how's our show look today, Jesse?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.320]   We got a good show today.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.280]   We have two blocks of questions.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.640]   There's some, something in there about hobbies, career anxiety, and then people
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.120]   want your advice on leaving a job.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.400]   Uh, we also have some calls and then we have, uh, a picture that you're going to
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.880]   take a look at that involves a closet, a little case study.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.520]   I like it.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.600]   I like it.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.800]   All right.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.240]   Sounds good.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.680]   All right.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   So we have all that coming up.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.440]   Uh, let's start however, as I like to do with the deep dive, the topic I want to
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.880]   tackle in today's deep dive is the art of no.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.720]   So saying no is a major part of my own professional life because I'm someone who
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.040]   has multiple jobs with multiple demands and am somewhat in the public eye.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.720]   So I have to spend more time saying no and thinking about how to say no and
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.120]   the ramifications of saying no, I would say than probably the average person.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.480]   So it's something that I have thought a lot about.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.040]   Uh, there's a couple of observations I've always had about saying no.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:47.120]   Number one, I think the average person creates this false binary between either
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   you're someone who basically says yes, or you are a disagreeable person who says no.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.480]   And they say, well, if those are my two choices, I don't want to be the
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.680]   disagreeable person that seems stressful and emotionally taxing.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   So I'm just the person who, who says yes, I kind of have to say yes, but it seems
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.880]   at all like it would be difficult to say no.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.080]   The reality though, is that everyone says no a lot, whether they know it or not,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.320]   whether it's implicit or explicit.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.800]   But if you think about it, most knowledge workers, you know, they have a full
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.600]   schedule, usually about 20% more full than they want it to be, but not impossibly full.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.240]   They're not working until 2am, but maybe they're working until 6pm.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.880]   It is highly unlikely that the exact volume of things that was put onto their
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.720]   plate that they said yes to just happened to exactly match an eight or nine hour day.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.040]   Right.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   Almost certainly there was many more things coming at them and they had the,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.360]   they had the sorted through and they basically were implicitly or explicitly
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   saying no, just enough to keep a day full.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.280]   So we're already all saying no, even if we don't realize it, we
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.920]   just do it somewhat haphazardly.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.160]   And I wrote a New Yorker piece about this last fall, where I said my theory
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.480]   about how most people informally handle the goal of saying, no, they don't have a
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.960]   plan, they don't have an intention, they don't have a vision for what
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.920]   they're trying to accomplish.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.560]   They instead wait until their level of experience stress is high enough that
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.200]   they feel emotionally justified turning someone down.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.560]   So it's like, I am so overwhelmed right now.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.720]   I feel justified saying no.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.960]   And until that point, I don't.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.720]   And what I argued in that New Yorker piece is that this is a terrible way to
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.960]   go about this because it ensures that you remain at a persistent level of
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.800]   elevated stress.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.120]   If you have to be sufficiently stressed to feel comfortable saying no, then
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.400]   you're never going to start saying no until you're sufficiently stressed.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   So you're going to stay at this level of being sufficiently
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   stressed, basically persistently.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.840]   So when we are not intentional about how we filter what we do and don't do, we
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.480]   end up in this default purgatory, this productivity purgatory of having just
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.520]   enough, just enough on our plate that it is bearable, but uncomfortable.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.200]   And we persist there.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.880]   So we burn out and don't produce what we want and all the other negatives to come.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   So what we need to do is be more specific with ourselves about how we figure out
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.040]   what's a reasonable workload, what that workload should be made up of, how we're
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.200]   going to go about dealing with requests to fit that load and not overload.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.760]   We need to be more specific about it.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.000]   That's why I was happy to see an article that someone sent to me, an alert
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.400]   listener sent to me, that appeared in a, it's a column in the journal Nature,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.760]   and it is written by 4Scientist.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.120]   And it is titled "Why 4Scientist Spent a Year Saying No" and it is an article
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.720]   that gets into the tactical weeds about the challenges and proper strategies
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.280]   for declining or turning away stuff that's going to overload you.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   Turning away work.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   So I want to go through this article because I often harp about this.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   Hey, you got to be more intentional about how you say yes or no, but we don't
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.360]   necessarily get into enough tactics about, well, how do I actually say no without
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.760]   feeling really bad or annoying people?
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.480]   All right.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.360]   So I have the article here.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.720]   So those who are watching on YouTube, so you can find this at
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.640]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   You'll see on the screen that we have the date highlighted.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.880]   This is from August 25th.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.800]   So this is recent.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.440]   Now the, the 4Scientist who wrote this column, their names don't show up in this
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.560]   version I have here, but, but probably relevant to this article, I believe all
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.240]   four are women.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.960]   So let's just, that'll come up a little bit later.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.800]   All right.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.160]   So I want to highlight a couple of things here.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.280]   First, just to start, let's give the premise for what they were doing here
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.800]   before we get to their specific advice.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.120]   So the premise is the following.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:42.480]   Last May, I'm quoting the article here, "Last May, facing pandemic and career
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.360]   burnout, this member whimsically suggested..."
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.680]   So member of these four scientists have a group that meets regularly to discuss
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.880]   just their career and the challenges of being scientists.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.160]   All right.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.560]   So back to the quote, "a member of the group whimsically suggested we make a
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.840]   game out of saying no by challenging ourselves to collectively decline 100
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.360]   work-related requests.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.440]   Thus, we spent a year tracking and reflecting on our decisions to say no."
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   So they started in May of 2021.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.680]   They finished in March of 2022.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.760]   So they got systematic about saying no and had four observations.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.000]   They call them here four insights about what they learned saying no systematically
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.480]   a hundred times over the course of a year.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   So let's go through these four insights real quick.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.680]   All right.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:40.880]   The first insight, "Tracking helped make no an option.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.280]   So they started keeping track of all the things they said yes or no to just a
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:46.880]   simple list.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.080]   So this is separate from whatever other organizational system you have for
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.280]   organizing your time or projects.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.680]   Let's just have a yes, no list.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   So as they pointed out, first of all, it helped them understand how much they'd
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.520]   already said yes.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.760]   It's easy to forget.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.560]   It also induced the gamification motivation of, well, how many no's do we
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:04.880]   have?
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.600]   I want to get a couple more no's this week.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.480]   Maybe I do want to say no.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.560]   What they then talked about is that once they started tracking no, this got them
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.160]   in the tracking mindset, which helped them in other ways as well.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   So reading from the article here, they say, "We logged completed tasks to
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.920]   counteract imposter syndrome.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.400]   We kept a running count of active projects and tracked how we were spending
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   time each day."
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.960]   This is all the type of stuff I recommend when you actually start tracking your
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.320]   time, your projects, what you're doing, what you're not doing.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.720]   When you actually confront what we talked about in the show, the productivity
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.320]   dragon of what's really on your plate, what you've slayed in the past.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.760]   This is all very important for you getting your arms around your work and
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   making confident plans for how you want to go forward.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.320]   As long as you exist in this liminal space of emails coming in, you're saying
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.360]   yes or no, you're jumping in and out of meetings and just always scrambling, but
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.320]   you're not really sure, what am I doing?
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.160]   How much am I doing?
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.000]   What have I gotten done?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   What am I saying yes to?
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.600]   If you don't know these things, you're a fireman.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.840]   You're putting out fires.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.920]   And people who put out fires eventually get burnt.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.160]   All right.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.520]   Number two, second thing they observed from this experiment, say no more often
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.120]   and to larger asks.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   So when they were reflecting, they said, "We declined too many little things, such
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.120]   as reviewing journal articles and not enough big tasks."
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   I think that's a good point.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   They were saying, "You could rack up the no's, but you could also rack up the
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.920]   no's quicker if you're aiming on the little things, the things that might take
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.600]   you a couple hours of the afternoon."
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.400]   But they're noting the things that caused the most stress were the big asks.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.920]   And they give some examples here, leadership opportunities, the chance to
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.120]   help write large grant proposals, et cetera.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.760]   By the way, all of this is giving me cold sweats because this is too close to home.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.480]   Jesse knows this.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.360]   Okay.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   So what they ended up doing is coming up with a series of questions, a series of
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.560]   questions to help evaluate when to say yes and when not.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.720]   So here's their questions.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.640]   They have five of them.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.080]   This is what they started asking to try to figure out, "Okay, is this something I
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.920]   should say yes to?
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   One, does it fit to my research agenda and identity?
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.200]   Two, does it spark joy?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.240]   Three, do I have time to do a good job without sacrificing extra commitments?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.560]   Four, does the opportunity leave space for my personal life?
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.520]   Five, am I uniquely qualified to fill this need?"
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   Right?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.560]   So that made it easier for them to say no because they had, eventually
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.400]   they had these criteria.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.800]   So when something big would come along, they would say, "Look, there's two of
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.360]   these criteria.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.080]   It doesn't pass.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   So now I have a reason to say no."
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:59.720]   Three, and this is an important one, maybe sometimes overlooked, saying no is
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.160]   emotional work.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.400]   It really is.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.280]   I have to say no a lot.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:11.320]   I just earlier this week got out, you know, said no to a speaking thing that I
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.560]   sort of went down the road with it because I thought it would be interesting, but it
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.960]   logistically was going to be a pain.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.760]   I knew I would regret it later on and it's hard.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.200]   And sometimes the other people get upset.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.680]   I would say nine times out of 10 people aren't really upset.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.120]   They just need an answer and they're moving on.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.400]   But just emotionally, the lived experience of saying no because of the way it plays
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   on our interpersonal social network wiring in our brain, the lived experience
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200]   is often quite stressful.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.640]   This hits different people differently.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   So here's the authors here I'm reading.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.640]   "In myriad ways, we saw how our cultural conditioning as women, academics and
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   public servants contributed to our difficulty with setting boundaries.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.160]   Tracking not just how often we said yes or no, but also our emotional responses
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.200]   made the emotional labor of saying no visible.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.120]   We often do ignore the emotional side of some of this otherwise seemingly dry
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.960]   technical productivity, uh, strategery.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.120]   That there is an emotional side to it.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.200]   I talk about in a world without email, there's non surprising, but well done
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.960]   surveys of workplace behavior that says if you start to categorize what they
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.680]   call non-promotable behavior.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.400]   So these are behaviors that aren't directly projects, activity tasks, not
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.280]   directly tied to being promoted.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:37.000]   So I will help organize the birthday party for Jesse, you know, next month.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.840]   Women were way more likely than men to be doing those like they were, they were
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.600]   disproportionately spending more hours on it.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   So there's these, these subtleties in terms of just the emotional exchange and
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.000]   saying no, not wanting to let someone down.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.880]   Uh, women are much less likely just to be straight up jerks.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   The guys can kind of get away with that.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:03.600]   In academia, you have a lot of guys that are barely in some fields, barely fit for
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.520]   social, like human social interaction.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.160]   If that makes sense, you can ask my wife about this.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.600]   She's been throughout grad school.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.200]   I brought her to a lot of, uh, computer science parties.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.160]   You get some of that.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.760]   You get out of a lot of work when you don't even want to have
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.680]   a conversation with someone.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.840]   So I think that's a good point.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.440]   They're pointing out.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.680]   Um, so what they say here is we need less logistical advice and more emotional
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.720]   advice when it comes to thinking about yes or no.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.680]   So let's acknowledge that.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.840]   I think that's a very important point.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.120]   All right.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.720]   In the same piece, they pulled out.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   I want, there's one other thing I want to highlight in the same section here.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   They were looking, what's the terminology here?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.920]   Soft no or little no.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.840]   So they had heard something called little no, which is where like you agree to a
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.400]   little bit or to do a lesser thing.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.960]   So it's not as emotionally taxing.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.640]   And they described that strategy.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.360]   That strategy for reducing the emotional toll of saying no to be a slippery slope
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.400]   that led people to ask for a greater commitment later on.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.240]   They went on to say only a firm no truly reduced our commitments.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.200]   That is so true to my experience.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.840]   I, you know, I become a master of that in my time.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.040]   You can't, can't try to soften the blow.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.120]   You have this sense of like, maybe there's a way I can say no here that I'm not
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.800]   really saying no, but I don't have to do the work.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.520]   It doesn't work.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.920]   You have to be incredibly clear.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.800]   And, you know, I I've learned this through experience where I'll say, I really
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.280]   appreciate this invitation.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.120]   I'm honored.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.840]   You thought of me.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.160]   Um, however, because of X, Y, Z, I have to say no to this request.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.400]   Like you have to have that piece.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's I unfortunately are with regrets.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.360]   I have to say no to this request.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.520]   You have to have that piece.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.880]   It can't just be like, yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.520]   You know, I'm pretty busy.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.760]   I'm not sure if this is going to work out and X, Y, and Z, and just hope that
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.800]   they're going to come back and say, you know what, you seem too busy.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.560]   Don't worry about it.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.320]   They won't.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.640]   They, their life will be easier.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.160]   If you say yes, as long as there's any opening, they're going to keep going.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.120]   You owe them and yourself clarity.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.800]   So that's, you have to have in there somewhere.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.760]   I've definitely learned this specifically.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.200]   I am saying no period.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.320]   And then you can add regrets and stuff like that.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.720]   That's fine, but don't give any wiggle room.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.400]   The other thing to say is don't say, well, I'm really busy right now.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.600]   Um, so I don't think I can do it this semester or this month because
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   they will be like, great.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.920]   How about January?
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.280]   So it has to be, uh, because of busyness or because of whatever I have to say no.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.440]   So you can answer back like, okay, but maybe you mean, yes.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:29.920]   All right.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.760]   Fourth thing, they, these authors, the fourth insight practice makes no
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.600]   easier as they did it more as they got closer to 100, it got easier to do.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.200]   So anyways, I like that article.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   Uh, and I liked the topic.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.360]   You, you, you have to control what is on your plate.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.480]   You are doing this, whether you have a plan or not, you are saying no to things.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.400]   You're turning things down.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.240]   You're probably just doing implicitly.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   You're probably just waiting until you're stressed and then lashing out
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.280]   randomly and trying to get out of things until people see you're so exhausted
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.560]   that maybe they stopped bothering you.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.160]   All right.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   That's not a good plan.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.400]   It's a plan, but it's not a good plan.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.120]   You need a better one.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   And I think this article is a, uh, a pretty good treatment of the topic.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.240]   So get more systematic about saying no, recognize the difficulty of doing so.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.440]   And it'll make your life in the long run, uh, a lot easier.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.000]   I say no all the time, Jesse, like my whole life.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.080]   I would imagine you get a lot of requests.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.800]   I do.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.520]   I do.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.480]   I mean, it helps.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.640]   I don't, this is why I don't have a general purpose way for people to reach me.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.440]   It's why there's, there's, um, if you go to my contact page, so if you're
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.160]   interested in speaking, here's my speaking agent.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.880]   If you have like a publicity thing, here's my contact page.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.000]   Here's my publicist.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.200]   If you have like a question about rights or translations or something about the
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.800]   books, here's my literary agency, right?
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.160]   It's like.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.000]   Your question has to get moved to someone who is not me.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.440]   If you want to send us links, which I love, here's the address,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.760]   but, uh, requests won't be answered.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.240]   Like we just make that clear on the site.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.760]   Like there's just too many of the messages that come through.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.440]   I love that you guys send me things, but I can't say I can't actually respond to it.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.640]   So there's not actually a general purpose place.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.480]   I mean, and then if people make their way, sometimes people make their way to my.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.880]   Georgetown address, but then I just feel fine.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.240]   Like if you're using that for a non-academic purpose, like you already
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.920]   know, like I don't, I'm not expecting to get a response.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.720]   I don't respond to those.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.640]   You know, it, it, it works.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.480]   I mean, it's, it's hard because it's nice to talk to people.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   And I used to interact with all of our, all my different readers and would answer
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.520]   every email and it took all my time and then I couldn't do anything else.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.480]   So it's, it's, uh, it is hard.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.600]   Uh, and then I still get a lot of requests.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.680]   I have to say no to, you know, I'll tell you the hard ones.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.960]   Sometimes they come from friends.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.240]   You know, it'll be, uh, the, the hardest ones and then, and then I'll, I'll leave it.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.040]   But I'll just say the hardest ones are, let's say it's a friend of the family.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.240]   Are, you know, who doesn't know much about me, but just
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.680]   like comes across something.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   And then is like, oh, I know him.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.840]   Like I know his wife, I know his mom or something like that.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.240]   And like, Hey, can you, uh, it's so exciting.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.320]   I saw you like, um, can you come like down to our office and like, come give a talk
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.400]   and like, you know, come join this webinar, do this and that.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.520]   And those are kind of the, those are the, those are the hard ones.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.760]   You know, it's hard to say no, which I do, but it's just hard to do.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   But you just have to, we just have to rip off the bandaid.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.200]   My wife's got used to that.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.280]   Just saying to people who know her and she's like, he just, he's not doing things
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:33.560]   right now.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.720]   And she has some phrase, she says, like, he's not, he's not taking
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.880]   on new things right now or something.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.000]   She's got the script optimized.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.480]   She's got the script optimized.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.040]   All right.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.440]   Well, speaking of optimize, this is not a great transition.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.920]   Speaking of optimize, let's read a couple ads.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.480]   How's that sound?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.200]   No, let's, let's pay the bills.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.480]   And then we got a good question block.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.760]   Uh, I want to talk about again, one of our longest sponsors that is Blinkist.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.280]   Ideas are power.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.680]   Best source of ideas are books.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.240]   That's where you have the people who've spent the longest time refining their
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.400]   thinking, and when you read the book, you're able to take these refined ideas.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.640]   From the mind of that writer and put them into your own mind.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.760]   That gives you more power.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.440]   That is your superpower.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.200]   The question is how do you figure out which books to read and which books
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.520]   you just need the main ideas from?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.000]   That's where you use Blinkist.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.720]   Blinkist condenses over 5,000 nonfiction book titles, spread over 27 categories
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.840]   into 15 minute summaries called Blinks.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.720]   You can listen to them.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.040]   You can also listen to those summaries.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.920]   They've also introduced a new product called Shortcast, which provides
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.520]   short summaries of popular podcasts.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.360]   So here is how you use Blinkist.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.240]   In my opinion, the best way to use Blinkist, there is a topic you're interested in.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.080]   Maybe you feel like you need to know more about crypto.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.160]   So you jump on Blinkist, you find some books, like I'm looking at the list right
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.400]   here, blockchain, blockchain revolution, read a blink, listen to a blink.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   15 minutes, 30 minutes later, you know, the lay of the land.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.000]   You know, the big, the big ideas and you know, crucially, do I need to read more?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.200]   And if so, which book I should read?
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.840]   So if you're a reader and if you're a listener of this podcast, you should be.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.520]   Blinkist is your sidekick.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.640]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   You have heard me mention before, I sleep hot.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.840]   I blast fans at me.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.240]   If this is why I don't like camping in the summer, I need to be cool to sleep.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   This is why I am a fan of systems that can go right on top of your mattress and
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   cool down that mattress to whatever temperature you want.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.960]   And SleepMe, the new home for ChiliSleep has the best systems on the market,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.040]   including the Uhler OOLER, Cube and Dock Pro Sleep Systems.

[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.040]   It's whisper quiet and has a tubeless mattress pad design that allows for five
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.320]   times more cooling contact.

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.200]   So let's do some questions.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.480]   What do you think?
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.240]   Should we start with a call?
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.000]   Is that what we're doing here?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.320]   Yeah, let's start with a call.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:47.560]   We got a call from Erica and she's going to talk about anxiety and time block
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.000]   planning.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.720]   Hello, my name is Erica.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.200]   I am a return caller and general asker of questions.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.000]   Today, my question is regarding anxiety and time block planning.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.280]   So one side of me loves to have my schedule set so I don't have to think about it.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:17.000]   But when I get to the day where I have something planned at a certain time, I get
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.440]   anxiety because there's this other side of me that loves flexibility.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.560]   I do like schedule throughout my day some unstructured time.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.800]   But and once I start an activity, I'm usually happy with doing the activity.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:39.920]   But I just get a lot of inertial pre-event anxiety and just a feeling of not wanting
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.880]   to do a certain thing at the time I have it.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.440]   So I'll give a good example.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.200]   Like I schedule a reservation at a restaurant, you know, like a month in advance
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.760]   or something that I'm really excited for.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:00.280]   But when the day comes, I just don't like feeling boxed in and having to be at the
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.600]   restaurant at a certain time.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.840]   But then I get there and I love it.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:13.200]   So do you have any like tips or thoughts on how I might be able to just get over
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.720]   this?
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.520]   I don't know.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.040]   I don't know.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.800]   I don't know the right term for it.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.120]   I guess pre-inertial anxiety towards a structured schedule of it.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.040]   All right.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.480]   Take care.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.080]   Bye.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.440]   Well, I mean, Erica, this is similar to what we were chatting about at the top of
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.520]   the show about the the resistance I feel to restarting my full time block planning
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.600]   system at the beginning of the fall.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.280]   You're feeling this, but basically on the scale of individual scheduled events or
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.040]   blocks, same underlying mechanisms and is quite normal.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.560]   Our brain does not understand by understand.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:59.200]   I mean, has not been evolved over deep history time to last two to 300,000 years
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.640]   where modern homo sapiens have walked the earth.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.880]   It has not evolved to work with scheduled events.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.480]   It's not evolved to work with.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.200]   I am now going to start doing this task because it's drawn up in a box on a piece
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   of paper.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:21.440]   I am now going to head over to a restaurant to eat because it's in my planner that
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.040]   that's what happens next.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.920]   That is not how our motivational loops are evolved to actually function.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.000]   They're, they're functioning.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.200]   They're, they're, they're meant to function on much more immediate and clear
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.000]   stimuli.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.240]   We need more food.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.040]   We're going for a hunt.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.600]   This person who's in front of me, who I can see.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.680]   So all of the social networks that take up so much of my neuron, neuronal space in
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.000]   my brain are all fired up and looking at this person in front of me, who's a part
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.560]   of my tribe.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.720]   Who's asking for my help.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.240]   We're going to go help that person.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.760]   We, we expect these more acute stimuli.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.280]   The brain does not understand a small box written in one of these or a little green
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.520]   glowing screen box on your screen, your Google calendar for an appointment.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.720]   It doesn't understand that.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.760]   So we have some trouble literally getting the motivational system to put the right
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   chemicals into our system that gets us up and actually moving.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.480]   There's something called the ventral striatum that's involved in this.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.000]   The neuroscience gets complicated.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.520]   Details don't matter.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.120]   We can, we'll get Andrew Huberman on the line if we really want to get into this.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.520]   Uh, but let's just rest assured.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.600]   That's what our brain does.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.200]   Different people, Erica have different reactions to this mismatch.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.000]   Right?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.800]   So some people it's yeah, whatever.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.480]   You have to just kind of.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.920]   Bull rush into the task.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.520]   Then you get going.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.320]   It's like, it's minor other people like you, Erica, uh, the mismatch triggers
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.160]   anxiety, which again, chemicals like anxiety is a physical feeling.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.040]   There's a constriction in the chest.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.360]   There's a, a difficulty in the breathing.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.520]   You can, you can do some self scanning and say, this is just physical.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.160]   Hormonal chemical driven reaction.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.840]   The autonomic immune system or a nervous system rather is involved in this.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.880]   And so for you and a lot of other people, this mismatch can create a literal anxiety.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.080]   The thing we have to do about this, uh, uh, put bluntly is sort of ignore.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   I mean, we can recognize my brain does this just like my knee
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.880]   hurts when a storm is coming.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   But beyond recognizing it, we still go forward.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.840]   We still go forward because let me tell you, let's say you get rid of your
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.720]   time block planning during the day, like let's just rock and roll.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.960]   So I don't have to have the anxiety of having something scheduled.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.480]   You're opening yourself up to a much more existential anxiety because you're
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.640]   going to just ping pong back and forth.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.200]   Randomly putting out fires, not making progress on things that are important
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.800]   for getting about things, having to scramble at the last minute to get things done.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.480]   This is not from a physiological perspective or a psychological
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.520]   perspective, a better subjective experience.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.800]   It's a deeper existential anxiety you're going to feel.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.720]   So you're trading one for the other.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.320]   Same thing.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.040]   If you don't go to the restaurant, you don't go to the party.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.640]   Uh, you're not going to feel better.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.560]   You'll get like relief in the moment because you're resolving the mismatch,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.440]   but you're not around friends.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.560]   You're not doing interesting things.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.680]   And, you know, I get that too, Erica, I don't get, I don't get anxiety around
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.160]   blocks if it's just work I've put aside.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.880]   I just get normal resistance.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.080]   When you throw a, there's different aspects.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.240]   Sometimes there's social aspects.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.440]   So this might be what you have.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.960]   There might be like a social aspect in there where there's a little bit of
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.880]   social anxiety, so that could exaggerate it.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.640]   Um, I don't have that so much, but I have, as I've talked about on the show,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.960]   these weird, deep rooted issues with surrounding sleep.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.680]   And so I'll sometimes get this around events.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.120]   If they're at night, like, you know, it's, I don't know how late it's
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.040]   going to go and what my sleep and, and you know, what I've learned to
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.120]   do is say, okay, thank you.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.400]   Welcome anxiety.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.240]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.840]   Chemicals you'll pass soon.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.080]   Uh, and I'm going to go on and keep doing this thing.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840]   So that's what I say, Erica.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.200]   Um, it's natural.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.480]   It's not that you shouldn't find it that interesting in the sense of like,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.040]   yeah, here, this comes, it'll go.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.240]   And you make the plans that are good.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.640]   You execute the plans and find pride in your action and not give so much
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.680]   attention to the physiological.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.720]   It's going to do its thing.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.520]   And then Erica, you're going to do your thing.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.560]   Because more often than not, it's going to be like an enjoyable experience
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.360]   to like going to the party or going to the gym or go to a game or something.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.720]   That's what I'm trying to separate here is like how much, how much we're
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.480]   dealing with the, the planning mismatch with Erica, which is a real thing.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.320]   I mean, people sometimes anxiety, a lot of times it's just procrastination.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.160]   It's like really hard for people to get started on things that are just, that
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.880]   are planned in some sort of abstract or arbitrary system, and there's also social
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.760]   anxiety and she's mentioned both.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.960]   In the call.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.720]   So I'm, I'm assuming they're kind of all mixed together.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.760]   I mean, social anxiety is its own, its own thing, which again, is completely
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.120]   natural because our brain is so attuned to the sociality that it, you know, a lot
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   of what, you know, 20 years, first century social life is not exactly what our brain
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.040]   expects.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   It expects like, this is my tribe that I am around all day.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.720]   I'm with them all day.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.000]   That's why I'm miserable when I'm alone.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.320]   But if it's strangers and some people I don't know, and it's in like a bar I
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.200]   haven't been to the brain is like, I don't know about this.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.360]   Some people care more than others.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.160]   You have negative social anxiety as far as I can tell.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.560]   You love people and you love doing things.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.680]   Well, I'm around a lot of people a lot, like in various, my other jobs and stuff.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   And yeah, I do a lot of things too, I guess.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.680]   That's a spectrum.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:43.760]   See, like probably for you, um, the way that wiring is set up is you see the, the,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.640]   the potential opportunity in a novel social environment.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.360]   Like, Oh, something cool could happen.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.320]   I could meet someone interesting.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.480]   Maybe I'll see something interesting.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.520]   For other people it will be, but what happens if I get there?
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   And like, I can't find the, I can't find the person or like, as I, as I walk into
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.240]   the, as I walk into the room, like I'm immediately, you know, caught catch on
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.760]   fire or whatever it is, the waiter spills water on me.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.880]   Really?
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   I had a friend, we used to joke about that.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.560]   We'd be anxious about like going to a bar we'd never been at before.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.600]   And we try to one up each other on our predictions for what was going to happen.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.720]   And it would usually end up with like, as the door open, just three or four
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.200]   people already at a full sprint are just charging you to take you down and to beat
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.480]   you with some sort of like bats or blackjack.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.800]   So then we'd see like how, how, how exaggerated we could make the story that
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.560]   would, you know, explain some social anxiety.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.360]   Like, as soon as you're in the door, it's just going to be like fire boys.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.280]   And like immediately there's someone with a flamethrower and, you know, you go over
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:46.600]   the top.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.200]   All right.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.880]   Let's do another question.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.520]   What do we have next?
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.960]   All right.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.400]   Next question's from Olivia.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.120]   Olivia is a product designer from New York city.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   She also feels anxious about choosing which hobbies to spend time on because she has
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.960]   lots of interest.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.680]   More specifically, she likes to write short stories and her most recent story was
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.480]   accepted from the slush pile on a top literary journal.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.040]   Now she feels pressure to pursue that hobby like alone versus dabbling in her other
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.720]   hobbies, which she considers mediocre, like drawing, cooking, exercise, and
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.360]   volunteering.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.440]   All right.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.400]   So a hobby question.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:34.680]   Um, so Olivia, I would say what's going to help you here is to introduce the deep
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.480]   life buckets into this conversation.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:44.440]   I think you're, you're lumping together too many things under the rubric of hobby.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.280]   So you're lumping together your amateur writing, which you're doing at a high level.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.680]   Right.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.840]   If you've made into a top literary journal, you're lumping that in with drawing,
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.760]   cooking, exercising, volunteering.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.240]   You see this as one thing and like, which of these do I do?
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.440]   Which of these do I have time to, if we look at this through the perspective of, uh,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.400]   the deep life buckets and let's go with the standard default buckets here, we'll do
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.520]   craft constitution, uh, community contemplation and celebration.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.640]   Let's do the default buckets.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.000]   You'll see that these now, these examples you gave, they fall out into these buckets
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.080]   in a more diverse way, right?
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.480]   So the writing you're doing, that's at the level of getting published
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.240]   in top literary journals, that's going to fall under craft.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.840]   It's not your paid job, but that is craft that it's, it's something where you are,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.600]   uh, honing a skill at a high level to produce things of value.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.040]   So I would, I would deal with that when I'm dealing with
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.560]   the craft bucket of my life.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.840]   Volunteering.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.440]   Now that's going to be under community.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   I would deal with volunteering as one of the things on the plate when trying to craft
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.000]   right now, what makes the most sense for me in the community bucket of my life.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.960]   Exercising.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.200]   Well, that's going to fall into the constitution bucket.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.240]   When you're contemplating, what do I want to do with a constitution in my life right
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:07.080]   now, my health and fitness exercises going to play in their cooking.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.800]   You could see coming into the celebration bucket, the bucket where you're trying to
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.000]   have gratitude and appreciation and of things in the world and experiences and
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.680]   things that you do that are sort of celebrating life and all the things that
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.040]   makes life interesting and good.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.480]   So these things fall in the different buckets, not just.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.840]   I have to have a hobby.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   What's my hobby going to be?
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.440]   Then how do you figure out which of these you have time for?
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   Well, now you're working the buckets in the standard way, right?
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.960]   You, you have a vision for each of these buckets that fit together to make sense
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.480]   for your life right now and are aiming you towards whatever vision you have for
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.640]   an ideal lifestyle in the future.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.400]   So you're looking holistically at your whole life.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.960]   You want to make sure that all of these buckets are represented.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.080]   You know, the system, if you've listened to the show, you start with Keystone
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.440]   habits and you give six to eight weeks to each of the buckets one by one to
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.560]   overhaul that part of your life.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.080]   That's when you deal with these things.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.160]   So when you're dealing with the community part of your life, you can say with where
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.760]   I am right now and the decisions I've made for the other buckets and what I'm
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.000]   trying to do at this stage of my life.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.080]   Community is important.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.600]   How am I going to integrate community in my life in a way that makes sense?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.880]   And maybe that involves volunteering.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.800]   Maybe it does it.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.520]   You know, if you're deployed in the military.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.400]   This year, then when you're thinking through community, that's going to be
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.080]   focused much more on, you know, connections with the people important to you back
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.200]   home, maybe you're thinking I'm going to write a long letters once a week.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   They're going to post publicly.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.600]   So all my friends can see what I'm up to.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.080]   It's going to focus on the people that you're deployed with and being there for
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.480]   them and mentoring to people below you.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.120]   It's not going to be volunteer opportunities.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.400]   On the other hand, if you're home and you're working part time and you have more
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.120]   time than you have before, then maybe that community piece is going to super
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.240]   expand and volunteering is going to be big, but this gives you a systematic
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   way of thinking about that.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.640]   Same with celebration.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.920]   What do I want to do in there?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.520]   And you're just, you're thinking through what, what actually fits into your life.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.960]   So that's the way I would actually think about it.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.360]   All right.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.760]   Now, what you're trying to do is come up with answers for these five
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.440]   buckets that fit together, make sense, and is tractable and be happy about that.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.040]   Now, what that looks like will depend on what phase of life you're in,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   what you're going after.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.360]   So, you know, when I was looking at your elaboration of your question, you
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.800]   mentioned, for example, that you are getting a part-time graduate degree
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.000]   in addition to your job.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.200]   Like this might be a period of one or two period where craft is really focused on
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.000]   like your job and trying to get this graduate degree.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.360]   And you're in very minimalist deployments of the other buckets, keeping those
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.800]   part of your life alive, but you have to keep them pretty minimalist because
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.680]   you don't have much time.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.960]   And then maybe when you're done with that graduate degree and you have more
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.400]   time, you reassess those buckets.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.720]   And now suddenly maybe you're reclaiming that time you were spending for your
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.480]   graduate degree to systematically work on your writing craft as a, as an
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   outlet for your creative energies.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.360]   So this, this can morph and change over time, but you have to see all of the
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.760]   pieces as part of a big picture.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.480]   And that's why I think.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.560]   Splitting into these buckets, making sure each bucket is dealt with, but that
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.200]   they all add up to something that's tractable.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.480]   That is the way to think about these, not in this much more simplified way of what
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.600]   hobby should I choose?
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.760]   You know, what is my hobby?
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.840]   I mean, that type of terminology is not that useful.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.120]   I mean, it's only recently that I've spent.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.080]   Any sort of systematic time on anything that you might qualify as a hobby, because
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.040]   I have a whole mess of kids and the youngest is now four, but that means until
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.560]   quite recently, I've always had someone between the ages of one and three,
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.680]   essentially in my household.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.880]   Like it's been really busy and I have seven jobs and that's fine.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.560]   So my bucket definitions were really heavy on craft and community.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.080]   And then there wasn't the other stuff I had to just have bare minimum.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.440]   So I respected them and prove to my point myself they're important, but
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.800]   they had to be very low impact.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.280]   I mean, kids are getting older.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.560]   Kids are at school every day.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.160]   I can rejigger the buckets.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.800]   So anyways, that's the way I would think about it, Olivia.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.520]   All right.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.920]   What's our next question here?
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.120]   So we have a follow-up question from Olivia as well, and she took advantage of the new
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.520]   question survey because we get to answer two questions from her back to back.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:11.800]   Yes.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.080]   If you're early, if you're early in answering, filling in that survey, you're
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.640]   much more likely to get your question answered than a few months from now.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.920]   So yeah, good, good advertisement for filling out the question survey.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.080]   So in her book, and she says in your book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, you give
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.800]   the following as a reason for leaving a job.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.680]   It presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.640]   skills that are rare and valuable.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.440]   She worries that in her job as a product designer, she's repeating the
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.160]   same work instead of getting better.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.200]   She studied literature in college.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.080]   And as we talked about, she did a part-time master's and well, she's doing a part-time
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.760]   master's in economics right now.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   These feel much more challenging, like something that you can truly develop
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.240]   expertise in at the same time.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.080]   She gets paid a lot as a product designer in tech.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.680]   So maybe the skill is valuable.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:09.000]   How can I, how can she decide if the first disqualifier applies to her career?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.680]   So just to put this in context, Olivia is referring to in my book,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.840]   So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.920]   I lean heavily on this idea that stop worrying about if you have the exact right
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   job for you, or that you have a passion that has to be matched to your career.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.360]   And if you don't exactly match it, then you're going to be miserable.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.600]   I argue that many different professional pursuits can be the foundation for a
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.480]   working life that's a great source of satisfaction, but I did give three
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.080]   disqualifiers, said, wait, here's three things that tell you that this might
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.360]   not be a job you should stay in.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.760]   So the first was what Olivia mentioned.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.960]   You don't really have options to build up skills that can then be used as leverage
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.360]   to shape your career going forward.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.000]   That was disqualifier number one.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.280]   Uh, I believe disqualifier number two, was it conflicted with values?
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.120]   So, you know, you're working for Philip Morris and, uh, the idea of so many
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.560]   people getting sick from smoking is like against your values.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.120]   And then three, I think was, you don't like the people, like these people
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.480]   are just, I can't stand them.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.880]   You know, like, uh, I don't mind being an investment banker from a,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.640]   from a values perspective.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.840]   I, you're going to have lots of options.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.640]   Cause I'll make a lot of money, lots of options if I get really good, but you
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.000]   know what, I can't take the, these people I work with at Goldman, right.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.680]   So that'd be number three.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:26.720]   All right.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.440]   So she's asking, do I think that first disqualifier applies to her
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.040]   job as a product designer in tech?
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.680]   She's worried, you know, is this something I can keep getting better
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.440]   and getting options, or is it something that I'm just going to
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.200]   eventually have to move on from?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.640]   What I would suggest in this situation is, and this is a evolution from the way
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.880]   I talked about this back in so good, they can't ignore you.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.680]   So it's been 10 years since that book came out.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.840]   So this is a bit of an evolution.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.320]   I would lean a little bit heavier on a lifestyle centric career planning
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.480]   approach to this question, as opposed to remaining more narrowly focused
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.280]   on just the aspects of the career.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:12.560]   So in lifestyle centric career planning, you have your vision for what you want.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   Your daily experience, what you want your life to be like in all different
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.920]   aspects, not just professionally.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:22.880]   And then you can work backwards and figure out how your work can help
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.880]   get you to that lifestyle.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.960]   So if you have this lifestyle fixed, the question then becomes, does this
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:35.320]   technology product design career that I'm in, do I see a way to use this,
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:40.280]   to grow in this, do I see a trajectory here that is going to support this
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.960]   lifestyle I have, this vision I have of my lifestyle?
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.320]   All right.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   And in answering that question, you probably want to look for role
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.640]   models, case studies, and examples, people at your company or other companies,
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.600]   freelancers, people on their own, but people within the same orbit of
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.640]   general skills that have done interesting things with it.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.760]   This will elaborate your understanding of what is possible with this job.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.520]   As you get good, what are the different options of what you can do with this?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.960]   You mentioned in your elaboration, I'm looking at it now.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.920]   You say some pretty stark things like only people in their twenties can be a
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.640]   product designer while their mind is fresh.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.040]   There are no product designers in their thirties.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.800]   Your only chance, your only option is to become a manager, but then even
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.280]   then you can only do that during your forties.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.720]   That's probably not true.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:26.240]   I mean, I think you probably need to be more systematic at learning what the
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:32.040]   different possibilities are for this general constellation of skills and not
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.600]   just, okay, within the company you work for and you know, what's the promotion
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.120]   chain here, but for product designers in generally people who work in different
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.640]   industries on product design, people who'd go out on their own, people who do
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.720]   freelance is there people who do this for this type of company and they do it.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.280]   Six months out of 12 and make a pretty good living at it.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.280]   And using that, they can live somewhere that's kind of cheap, but exotic and
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.600]   interesting on a farm somewhere.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.160]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.040]   You got to get out there.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.480]   You got to get the information and then figure out seeing all these different
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.000]   options.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.240]   Do I see a way of deploying any of these to get to my, my image of ideal lifestyle?
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.640]   And if yes, go for it.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.680]   If no, then yeah, you can say this disqualifier applies.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.720]   So that's my evolution.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.240]   Let's, let's use lifestyle more and be a little bit less narrowly focused on just
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.160]   what is this job?
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.200]   What am I going to get from this job?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.920]   We're going to go for this job because ultimately.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.160]   What does that matter if it's not serving the life that you're actually aiming to
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.840]   achieve?
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:31.040]   That comes back to when you talk about being a reporter for your own job,
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.600]   essentially, you talk about that a lot.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.040]   Act as if you're a reporter and figure out what the steps are to do X, Y, Z.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.560]   Like you're writing a book or an article about how people get here in my career,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.680]   go talk to people, look up people's resumes online, read profiles of people in
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.200]   your industry.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.200]   You got to be like, I'm going to write a book about product design and the career
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.280]   possibilities of product design.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.000]   So it's a, yeah, a research mindset.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.200]   All right.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.920]   What do we got next?
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.960]   Uh, next we have a question from Jackson, 25 year old in Vermont.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   For the past two years, I've been working for an ambulance service running a COVID
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.160]   testing site, which was shut down in late June.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.520]   I'm searching for more technical work and I'm struggling to break into the field of
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.160]   knowledge work.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.520]   I have a degree in philosophy and I'm looking mostly at work with, within
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.040]   Vermont.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.160]   Well, I mean, Hey, first of all, good news embedded in that question.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.840]   The COVID testing site was a shut down.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.720]   So, Hey, there we go.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.120]   We get some like positive pandemic news and, uh, Oh, wait, I'm looking at an
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.800]   update here.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.960]   It shut down because, um, everyone involved was hospitalized with COVID.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.000]   Oh, so you can see, I thought it was positive.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.160]   I thought it was positive.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.680]   And Oh no, this guy, this guy was not.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.840]   So one person, uh, Oh, but he got monkey pox.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.520]   You know, see, I thought, I thought we had something positive here.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.600]   Every time we think we're this close to something positive, something negative
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.000]   happens.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.640]   Um, all right.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.000]   Well, Jackson, I have, I have a, a, uh, an answer to your specific question, then a
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.440]   more general suggestion to tack onto the end of it.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:12.760]   So for your, your general question, um, if you want to work for the state, not a bad
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.240]   idea.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.280]   Actually, when I was in Vermont last summer, Jesse, we met several people who
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.000]   worked for the state in Vermont.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.760]   There's a whole thing where like you work for the state and maybe you go to
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.720]   Montpelier sometimes and they all ski all the time.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.840]   And they seem like they're outside all the time and like a really stable job and
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.640]   they're always outside.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.920]   And it's actually, it seems like a, a, a cool state to work for the state because
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.280]   you can, there's a lot of these jobs.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:40.520]   It's like, yeah, I'm in charge of the like mushroom management program, whatever
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.200]   that takes like nine hours.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.120]   And then they cross country ski the rest of the day.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.640]   So Jackson, what I'm saying is you have an interesting plan here.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:53.120]   Um, so I think what you need to think about is not the specific job you're going to
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.960]   get right away, but the department or program in which that job lives, because
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.720]   once you're inside that department or program, if, and when you prove yourself
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.160]   to be so good, you can't be ignored.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.960]   You can move within a department or program relatively easily.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.600]   So with that in mind, maybe you need to aim at something that you're not
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.800]   interested in, but you need to aim at something that's temporary, something
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.440]   that's more entry level than you might be looking for long-term and have the plan
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.800]   of give me a year and I'm going to move up to something cooler.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.160]   I'm going to be moved to something more interesting.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.640]   I just need to get my foot in the door.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.800]   So lower your standards for the very first job you're going to get in the state.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.160]   With the plan of that will be far from your last.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.080]   And the way you do that, this is my advice.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.280]   I always give the people who are in their, their young twenties and new to some
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.240]   of the things that I've said, once you have the job, don't let things drop through
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.080]   the cracks, if you agree to it or it's put on your plate, you will not forget it.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.640]   It will get done to deliver things when you said you would.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.600]   And three consistently deliver at a high quality, do those three things.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.920]   You will become indispensable.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.400]   And if you are indispensable, you're going to get more and more freedom and
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.600]   flexibility because people were going to want you there.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.720]   They're going to want to keep you there.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.120]   They're going to want you on your projects.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.480]   They're going to want you to be there.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.640]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.

[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.

[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.

[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   And you're going to be a part of it.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   >> Hello, Cal.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   My name is Connor Beck.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   And I am a copywriter and content marketing specialist from St. Paul, Minnesota.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   I really enjoy your show and all of the amazing insights that you provide.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   So thank you for that.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   My question has to do with project management tools, specifically Wrike and other related project management tools.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.680]   My company, my current company, and the past two that I've worked at have used Wrike.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   And I've seen it work well and I've seen it work not so well.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   And it seems to be less effective when it gets overly complicated.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   So my question is how would you suggest companies and teams use tools, project management tools like Wrike or Monday.com,
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:52.680]   in order to facilitate deep work rather than create unnecessary distractions and waste of time?
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.680]   Thanks again for your insight, Cal.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.680]   And yeah, keep up the good work.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.680]   >> All right. Well, right off the bat, I'll admit I know Monday.com.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   I don't know Wrike.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.680]   I'm actually going to load it up.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.680]   Let's see here.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.680]   This could be -- I'm loading up on our tablet here, Jesse.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680]   I'll tell you when I have it.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   >> Okay.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680]   >> Wrike.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.680]   Let's see what we're dealing with here.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   Wrike project management.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.680]   Hold on.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.680]   All right.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.680]   I have this loaded up on the tablet here.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   Wrike, W-R-I-K-E.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   It says managing multiple projects shouldn't be a struggle.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.680]   Sounds good to me.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   Trusted by 20,000 happy customers.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   Oh, Lord, this is looking complicated.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   All right.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   Build a path, it says.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   Streamline your process and gain visibility at every stage.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.680]   You can use custom workflows.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   Create custom workflows to help your team stay on the same page.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680]   Easy to implement.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Simple to use.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   We have animation here.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.680]   Man, there's a lot going on here, Jesse.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.680]   You see this?
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.680]   They're like clicking four deep into this.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.680]   They click on a thing to a submenu to a submenu to change the color of the status.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.680]   There's a blinking light.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   All right.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   You can set timelines.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.680]   Here's a Gantt chart that they're dragging things on.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.680]   Prioritize and visualize.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:19.680]   They're dragging pictures between -- oh, this is like a Trello board.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   You've got to have an obligatory photo of someone in an office that's all white.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   White shelves, white walls, a few books.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.680]   They're always very happy.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   Look at this person in this picture.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   She's like, "I'm so happy to be using Wrike.com in my white office."
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.680]   It's never like the disheveled guy with the five o'clock shadow,
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.680]   the giant Starbucks cup that's like, "Ugh."
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.680]   Like a kid got sent home from school with headlights.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   I've got to get out of here.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   All right.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   Look, here's my thing.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   Here's my thing, Connor.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   The issue with project management tools, be it Wrike or Monday.com or what have you,
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   or methodologies like Scrum or Kanban,
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   the issue becomes when you think that the tool or the methodology itself is the solution.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.680]   If we can just do this thing right, it is going to solve our problem.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   Like, "Hey, we're disorganized.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.680]   We're seeing too much email.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.680]   We're having a hard time keeping up with projects at our company.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   What tool will solve this problem?"
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.680]   This is the way they market themselves.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   It's this clear CTA.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.680]   You send us this money to subscribe to Wrike and then your problems go away.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:40.680]   But no tool or methodology on its own is guaranteed to solve the problem.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   What I recommend doing instead is you have to figure out before you think about technology,
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   how do we actually want this type of collaborative effort to unfold?
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.680]   What type of work we're doing?
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   Who is involved?
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.680]   What's involved in our specific work?
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   Let us come up with a process or workflow here to get this done in a way that is not only organized,
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:08.680]   but as I like to harp on, minimizes the need to receive and respond to unscheduled messages.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.680]   And then you can say, "Okay, now what tools are going to help us do this?"
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   And here's the thing.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   When you do this type of planning, where you plan the process first
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.680]   and then go looking for the tool to implement it,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.680]   more often than not, the tools become the easy part.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:30.680]   You use more simple, versatile, multifunction tools to implement the process you designed.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.680]   This is why you're going to see more use of Google Docs or Trello boards or Google Sheets,
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.680]   like Dropboxes, just simple things,
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.680]   because the smarts is in the custom process you came up with for the specific work you do
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   with the specific people you work with.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   The promise of something like Wrike or @Scrum or Monday.com,
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   it's all the complexities of how the work unfolds is already figured out and baked into their software.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.680]   So then you have to fit what you're doing to their particular system.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.680]   It's like a totem that you trust is going to deliver freedom from stress,
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.680]   and that's much less likely to work.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680]   And it does lead to, as Connor pointed out in his call,
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   especially in technical circles, so when technical workers start using these systems,
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.680]   obsessions with details.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.680]   I mean, programmers tell me this all the time about Agile.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.680]   Use Scrum, like an Agile methodology like Scrum.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680]   There's some basic ideas here that make a lot of sense.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   But people get so in the weeds of like,
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.680]   "If we don't exactly right have the Scrum master second lieutenant,
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   use the appropriate every other Thursday tribal council session after intermission
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   to do its Scrum message circle delivery of this point,
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   I'm not going to get enough experience points to kill the ogre in the dungeon."
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.680]   They get really obsessed about these details as if like there's this magic system,
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   and the reason why it's not working is that you're not satisfying the gods of Scrum properly.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.680]   There's some sloppiness in your implementation,
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.680]   and then it just gets so annoying that nothing happens.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.680]   So this is why I always say forget the tools, get the process,
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   and then implement with the tools, because that puts your focus on,
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   "Hey, us, people, team, how do we want to do this work?
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.680]   Like, what makes sense? Let's not just email each other.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.680]   I mean, I think what we should do here is have a place where we collect the client questions,
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.680]   and twice a week we get together and go through the client questions,
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   and we'll just throw them in a Google Doc, and we can just mark right there.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   What's the easiest way to do this? Just mark right there, and you're like,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.680]   "Okay, Jesse's going to work on this," you know, put the notes there, and then we'll check it.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.680]   You know, just figure this stuff out.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   Like, the intelligence is in the custom, informal, flexible, interpersonal plans
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.680]   you've made with other people that make sense for exactly your context,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.680]   and then use tools to implement it.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.680]   My main analogy I use for making this point, like when I give talks about this,
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:52.680]   is when you look at a really effective system from times past,
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.680]   like the first efficient continual motion assembly line that Henry Ford put together
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   at the River Rouge plant up in Michigan.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   The way this happened was not Ford was at some industry conference
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   and saw this assembly line system and methodology and said,
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   "Let's buy that and install that in our car factory."
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   No, he invented it from scratch. What's the right way to actually build cars?
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.680]   And then he brought in existing technology, invented a lot of new pieces of technology
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   to implement the thing that he came up with as the right way to build cars.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   So you start with the process, then you gather the tools to implement it.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   And maybe something like Wrike or monday.com is like, "Oh, this is great.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.680]   This has all the pieces we need for our plan.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   We can turn off these features. We can use these features."
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   That's great, and that's a good way to use those tools.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   But you got to start with the process first before you get anywhere near
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   giving your credit card number to a software service company.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:54.680]   All right, let's do another question. What do we got, Jesse?
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   We got a question from Andrew. He's a 33-year-old teacher in London.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:04.680]   And he says, "In episode 211, you laid out your system for organizing your life.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.680]   I was wondering how quarterly plans link to the system.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   Are they the same as strategic plans or something else?"
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:18.680]   They're the same. Quarterly plans, strategic plans, semester plans.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.680]   I'm going to say that because I'm a really great clear communicator,
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.680]   have used all three of those terms to mean more or less the same thing over time.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.680]   They all mean the same thing.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:36.680]   A plan that is focusing in particular on the next three to five months
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.680]   and what your goal is and your approaches,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.680]   everything you need to know about what your vision is for that upcoming quarter,
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   that upcoming semester, whatever you want to call it.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   I think strategic plans, if we want to get into the etymology,
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.680]   strategic plans, I introduced that term because before it was
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   business people think in terms of quarters, so they call this the quarterly plans.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.680]   Academics think in terms of semesters, so they call this the semester plan.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.680]   And so both are valid.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.680]   I don't want to keep going back and forth or using both.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.680]   So strategic plans was supposed to be a general term that captured both.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.680]   So thanks for that question, Andrew. That does help clarify things.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.680]   Let's do one more, Jesse. What do we got?
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.680]   All right. Final question is from Allison.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.680]   She's a 29-year-old software developer in Washington, D.C.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.680]   She says, "Hi Cal. In your previous podcast,
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.680]   you talked about how you organize your life and your core documents.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.680]   How did you create your values document?
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.680]   How do you know what values are important to you?"
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.680]   Well, first of all, I'll say I'm distracted by our tablet here
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.680]   with the Reich animation I'm looking at right now.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:49.680]   My Lord, there's a histogram, a stacked histogram of task completion per person
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.680]   stacked by the different categories of tasks moving up and down.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.680]   Man. Okay. Sorry, Allison.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:02.680]   I'm entranced by the visual complexity that is these project management tools.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.680]   Wait till they see our whiteboard, Jesse.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.680]   We're too simple. We have a whiteboard and Google Docs.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680]   Dropbox.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   We do use Dropbox. Yeah. No stacked histograms.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680]   All right, Allison, I'm sorry. This is an important question.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.680]   Okay. How do you come with your values document?
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.680]   Here's the key thing about values documents, which again,
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.680]   for people who didn't hear episode 211,
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.680]   my suggestion is you have a document that has your core values
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680]   that you review on a regular basis.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.680]   It becomes the foundation for everything else you do.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.680]   So when you write your strategic plans for like,
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.680]   what am I doing for the next semester?
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.680]   All this stuff comes back to, am I serving my core values?
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.680]   The key point about that is there's not a single right answer to that,
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   that you have to get just right before the document can be used.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   Your notion of what your values were will evolve over time with experience
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.680]   and exposure to other systems of thought.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.680]   What's important is that you have something that makes sense
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   and aligns with your experience intuition at the moment
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   and that you're using it.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.680]   This gives you intention and direction with your life.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.680]   Even if that direction shifts over time,
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.680]   you're still always better moving at any one moment
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.680]   in an intentional direction, as opposed to just wandering around.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.680]   So otherwise I'm going to try to say here, Alison, is lower the stakes here.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.680]   I wrote my original values document.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.680]   I was in my twenties as a grad student.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.680]   I remember for some reason, I remember this.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.680]   I have a weird memory for certain things.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:28.680]   I wrote in my Moleskine and it was,
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   we were waiting to go to sit Shiva with a friend of ours,
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.680]   a friend of ours who was at Harvard grad student, whose dad had died.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:39.680]   So his dad had died, you know, young and we were going to go sit Shiva
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.680]   and it gets you thinking about things.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.680]   And I remember that's when the very first draft
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.680]   and I'm sure I have that Moleskine somewhere.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.680]   I have a stack this high of these old Moleskines
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.680]   where I keep track of ideas about my values and living the deep life.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.680]   That's why I worked out my first value plan.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.680]   And this just evolved since then.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   Getting married changed that.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680]   I mean, I was married at that point already.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.680]   Having kids changed the values plan.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:04.680]   Career shifting changed the values plan.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:08.680]   When you, if you encounter or discover systems of,
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.680]   organized systems of moralistic thinking,
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.680]   be it philosophical or theological.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.680]   Now you're tapping into really ancient wisdom
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680]   going to affect your value plan.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.680]   So the thing will evolve, but you do, you got to start.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.680]   You want to have something.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.680]   So that's the way to think about it, Alison.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   Having something is better than not.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   Don't sweat if you have the right thing
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.680]   because that will evolve with your, with your life experience.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.680]   So you keep all your Moleskines?
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   For century twenties?
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680]   I keep Moleskines.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680]   I guess if you go back and look,
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.680]   you can kind of see it's like a diary, you know.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.680]   I keep a lot, not all of them.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.680]   I also have a lot of time blocking.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.680]   So I have a lot of these old planners
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   and then the ones I was a lot of black and reds from before.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.680]   I don't keep all of those.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.680]   I realized like I don't need all of these,
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.680]   but I have a fair number of those.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680]   Yeah, but the Moleskines I keep.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.680]   I've gone back through before.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.680]   There's some, I've done blog posts from now and then
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.680]   or email newsletter articles every once in a while
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.680]   where I'll take a picture of like the teetering stack.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.680]   I last went through them for digital minimalism.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   I was writing about journaling in digital minimalism.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.680]   And so I actually went back and cited a bunch
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.680]   of things from old Moleskines.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.680]   It's kind of cool to go back.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   Go back and read.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   I mean, you, you get older, your thoughts mature
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680]   is what I would say.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.680]   That's my, that's my experience going back
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.680]   and reading my 20, 21 year old Moleskines.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.680]   But there's cool things.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   I mean, the coolest thing I found was the transition
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.680]   in my writing life when I was leaving student writing
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   and trying to make that decision because I'd written
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.680]   three books for students.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.680]   My newsletter slash blog was called study hacks
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   and it was just for students.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   It had traction.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   I was probably one of the top people writing
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.680]   on that topic.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.680]   I was like, I can just own this topic.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.680]   Like I'm owning it now.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.680]   I brought some new things into that world.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.680]   I was working.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   And then also I was thinking I can't just do this
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   for the rest of my life though.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   Like I'm not going to be a student forever.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.680]   And like, do I want to just keep doing this?
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.680]   And I worked a lot of that out in my Moleskine.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.680]   And I have a weird, my wife knows this.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.680]   I don't have a fully memetic memory, right?
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   Like I don't have photographic memory,
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.680]   but I do for certain things like books.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   I can remember like almost every book where I read it
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.680]   where I was anytime I'm writing or reading.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   So I have a very clear memory.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.680]   And this must've been God, 2008, very clear memory.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.680]   Coolidge corner movie theater, Brookline, Massachusetts
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.680]   because my wife, I used to see every movie,
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]   literally every movie.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.680]   And we were there to see, it was a Disney nature documentary
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.680]   about lions and lion cubs.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680]   Cause we just saw it.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.680]   Like we've seen everything what's playing.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.680]   Right.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.680]   And I remember being in the main theater at Coolidge corner,
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.680]   the main, the nice one that has the old fashioned theater
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.680]   with the curtains or whatever.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   And we were watching that movie.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.680]   And I remember sitting there with my Moleskine
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680]   and working through.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.680]   So if I see those notes,
