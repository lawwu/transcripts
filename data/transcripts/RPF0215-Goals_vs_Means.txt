[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.520]   Hey, radicals, welcome to the show. My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   We're going to call this episode of the Radical Personal Finance podcast more of a coaching call.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.480]   This is not necessarily, this is not, certainly not our traditional podcast format. I doubt today's
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.720]   show will be over 10 minutes. Here during the month of July, I'm going to be releasing a few
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280]   short shows here and there as I spend some time loving my wife and loving my kids as we transition
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.520]   to enjoying our new baby here. So today, I want you to take the time that you would normally spend
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.640]   listening to the show. Listen to the next few minutes of coaching advice and then turn off the
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.080]   show or turn off however you listen, phone, internet, whatever, and spend a few minutes
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.000]   thinking if you're driving, if you can't write, or spend a few minutes writing a few things down.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.520]   And I want to talk to you about the question of goals versus means. And I'm not quite sure if
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.480]   that's the right word for it, but you'll understand in just a moment what I mean.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.360]   Here's what I mean. What are your true goals? What are your actual goals?
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   Very few people actually know what their real goals are. Now certainly if you take some time
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.320]   and you write down a list of goals, you'll be able to come up with some things that you're
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.880]   working towards. But depending on how much time you spent thinking about them and working them,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   those goals might or might not be your actual goals. Now only you are going to know and be
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.000]   able to discern and tell whether they're your goals or whether they're your actual goals.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.760]   But it's an important thinking process to go through. Let me give you an example. This example
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.720]   comes from my life. I'm going to give you three specific examples, all of which come from my life.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   But let's start with this one. Most of my friends who know me know that I'm,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.080]   I was going to say semi-obsessed, but the reality is obsessed with the concept of
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   travel. My wife likes to joke about how much time I spend looking at different things on travel.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   Specifically what appeals to me the most of all the different types of travel that I've done
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   is what now has the fancy word of overlanding, overland travel. The idea is you have your own
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.280]   vehicle and you get to travel when and where you want. I have no problem backpacking and
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   using public transportation, but I just kind of like being able to go where and when I want and
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.520]   control my own itinerary. Now the interesting thing when you get into the world of travel
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.360]   and you start looking around in the forums online and the websites that cater to this segment and
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   this demographic, people who share the interest, it is absolutely astounding how much money and
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.040]   time people spend outfitting their vehicles for travel and how little time and money people
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.240]   actually spend traveling. It's incredible. Now I'm a sucker for a fancy truck as much as the next guy.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.800]   I can sit here and tell you about the latest Unimog-based RV that will take your family of 11
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.920]   through the world and can drive through five-foot-deep mud and up to the top of Kilimanjaro.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   I think that stuff is as cool as anyone else. I love to sit and look at videos of Land Rovers and
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.440]   Land Cruisers and they got all of their bumpers and winches and lights. I like that stuff as much
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.520]   as anyone else. But I can't help but notice how much time and how much money and how much energy
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.920]   people spend buying stuff to bolt onto their car ostensibly for the purpose of going traveling
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.800]   and how little time they actually spend on the road. Now here's what's even more interesting to
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   me. Every place I've been around the world and there are a lot of countries I haven't been to
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.320]   but I've traveled in some quite varied countries. Everywhere from the large countries of Europe,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   Germany and England and Scotland and Austria and all these places, Italy. I've also traveled a
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   little bit in Egypt and in Haiti and in South America, excuse me, in Colombia, yeah, that's
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.000]   South America. Also in Nicaragua or Guatemala and where else? A bunch of other places like that.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   And the thing that I have noticed is that in those places that I have been, even if whether
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.200]   you're on the beach in Costa Rica or out in the middle of the jungle, almost nobody
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.600]   owns a big fancy four-wheel drive vehicle. But I don't know about those of you who live
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.640]   elsewhere in the world but just about everyone who thinks they're going to travel in the United
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.720]   States goes out and they got to buy a big fancy four by four. But when you actually go to the
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:11.280]   places that many people want to go to, you find that some guy is driving his little two-door
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   beat-up Toyota Tercel down a rutted back road and parking it on the beach. And then when it
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.840]   gets stuck and the tide's coming in, you just get six or seven guys and they put a shoulder into
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.800]   the back of the car and they push it away again. It's not that big a deal. You don't need a $2,000
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.400]   winch and a $1,000 custom bumper for your car. Now, I'm picking on something that is â€“ again,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.760]   like I said, it's something that I like but I think it's a good illustration.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.400]   Is your goal to have a big fancy vehicle that seems impressive to everybody or is your goal
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.720]   to have a big fancy vehicle that is something that you really like? I'm not diminishing that.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.000]   I think it's fine to have stuff you like. Or is your goal to travel? Because if your goal is to
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   travel, all you got to do is get in your car, turn the key and drive. You can drive down to Walmart
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.080]   and toss a $150 tent in the back trunk and toss a Coleman stove back there and a little sleeping pad
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:17.360]   if you want to get luxurious and go. It doesn't cost that much. Just get out there and go.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.080]   But see, that would involve overcoming the fear of actually going and that would involve actually
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.320]   doing something about your dreams and doing something about your goals instead of sitting
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.960]   around writing on the internet about the next little doodad that you want to buy for your car.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.480]   Now, in fairness, I recognize that there are some people for whom their most enjoyable travel is to
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   be able to go and drive through the middle of the swamp. Fine. Go for it. But for the majority of
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   people, I think, "Wow, that's not so much. I mean you never put the thing in four-wheel drive and
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.320]   you just take what you have." So my point is don't confuse your goals. If your goal is to have the
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.880]   latest, greatest land cruiser with all of the associated farcle that makes it beautiful, fine.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   Go for it. But if your goal is to go to Mexico, get some time off, quit your job,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.680]   take a couple thousand bucks out of the bank and go to Mexico.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   You can skip this whole hassle of spending months and months and months
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.960]   getting a bunch of stuff ready that you never need. And if your goal is to travel,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.520]   you don't have a car, well, take a bicycle. If you don't have a bicycle, go for a walk.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:39.840]   Wasn't that long ago that traveling meant taking a walk and you can still do that. Now, again,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.360]   I don't necessarily want to go travel that way. But if I were broke and single and I'm
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.680]   looking around and saying, "Man, I'm in need of an adventure," I might just go and take a walk.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.280]   And you can have some beautiful, amazing experiences when you're walking across the
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.000]   country for a year. And it doesn't cost as much as buying a $100,000 RV to RV across the country.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.640]   Again, filter this through what you actually want. If you want to travel in a certain lifestyle,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.880]   fine. But many of you don't. But yet many of you are sitting around thinking, "Oh, I want
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:21.280]   this fancy gear." And the reality is just go. Don't waste the time. Just go accomplish the goal.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.080]   Two other examples that come to mind is something like a house.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:34.000]   Many people have a dream of a big fancy house. And I think that's great. I live in a world of
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.640]   fancy houses. And sometimes I'll be over at a friend's house and I'll be and I look around
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   and say, "Man, my house is not so fancy. I don't have a beautiful pool with a swim up, not a
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.480]   lanai, a swim up bar where I can serve drinks over the swim up bar and they can sit on the little
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.520]   pools in the bar. I don't have that. I don't have a 65-inch grill with 16 burners so I can
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:05.200]   cook 200 hamburgers at a time. I don't have that." But the question is, do I really need or want to
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:13.280]   own that kind of house? Do I really need or want the swim up pool? Or is my actual goal having the
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:20.640]   ability to have a good time with my friends, be able to entertain them, be able to have some kind
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.800]   of forum in which I can spend time with the people that I care about? Now, if you've got the money
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   and have the fancy house, use it. And if you like to entertain in the pool and so therefore it's
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.760]   worth the money to you, awesome. But if you figure out that really what you want is just the ability
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.240]   to entertain some friends, don't wait until you can spend an extra $200,000 on a house that has
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.000]   a pool with a swim up bar. Get a cooler, find a cool spot down by the beach, stuff the cooler full
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   of beer, go buy yourself a big fancy $200 grill and drag it down to the beach and make a destination
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.840]   out of it. Set up a water slide on the hill, an adult water slide, or do something unique that's
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   going to allow you to create the experience. And you can entertain just as beautifully in a public
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.800]   park with a little bit of thought and a little bit of creativity as you can with a $200,000 pool.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:26.720]   Think about it. I guess the only other example that I'll mention here is the dead horse that
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.360]   I beat over and over on the show. This show is dedicated to helping you build financial
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.760]   independence for you, for yourself and for your family. But I think so much of the time,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.920]   especially in this early retirement financial independence community of which I'm a part,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.080]   a lot of the time we're focusing on things that aren't an actual goal.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:54.640]   Yes, I want to be financially independent and I want to be financially independent in a basis
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:02.240]   where my investments are able to provide for my lifestyle. But that's a farther down the road goal.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.520]   And for many of you, that's also a farther down the road goal.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.920]   My actual goals are simply autonomy.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:23.280]   The ability to decide from day to day based upon all of my goals, my life on an integrated basis.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.840]   My actual goals are just to be able to do what I feel I need to do on each individual day
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.320]   without somebody saying you need to be here at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.720]   So once I identified that, it's much simpler to go the path of entrepreneurship and create
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   a business that I want to own than it is to save a million dollars. It's much simpler to,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   if you recognize that what you actually want is to get out of a job that you hate
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.040]   and go to a job that you love, much simpler to do that than to save a million dollars.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:02.720]   If you find out that, well, we actually just don't like living in the South where it's hot,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   well, go get a job at a bike shop in Boulder, Colorado,
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   or move to New York and start a plumbing business.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:20.000]   Or if you find out you're tired of the snow, move down and do something interesting. And it doesn't
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.960]   even have to be anything exotic, but just do something interesting in another place.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:31.200]   A 40-hour a week job as a librarian or as a coffee shop owner in a place that you like to be,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.840]   for many of you, is all that you want or need for financial independence.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:45.120]   Now, you'll have to figure out how to apply these ideas and concepts to your life. And my challenge
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:54.080]   for you is ask yourself the questions, "What do I want?" And the follow-up question is, "Why? Why
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.640]   is that important to me?" There's a useful technique sometimes used in coaching or in
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.680]   counseling. You can use it for yourself to coach and counsel yourself. But the technique is simply
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:12.960]   to ask yourself three follow-up questions. "What do I want?" And let me go through a chain as an
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:21.920]   example. I want to buy a bigger house. That's what I want. Okay. Why? Well, I feel like my house is
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.440]   overflowing at the seams. I've got stuff everywhere and I can't get through the hallway because
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:33.120]   there's stuff stacked on every side. Okay. So what you actually want is a cleaner house. Why?
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.960]   Well, I'm really frustrated at the fact that I spend all my time cleaning and moving stuff here
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.840]   and there rather than enjoying my Saturdays. Okay. So what you actually want is to be able to enjoy
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.720]   your Saturdays. Why? Well, I really hate what I do during the week and so Saturday is the only
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:00.080]   time that I have. So when I work this job I don't like and then I come home and then I have to spend
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:08.960]   all my time moving and sorting my stuff then I feel frustrated with that. Ah, okay. So my example
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.800]   breaks down. I should have come up with a better one but hopefully you see it might be in this case
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.360]   that the goal is not actually a bigger fancier house but the goal is actually to make that job
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.200]   change over a period of time and to throw away some stuff. And it might be that the house that
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   you have is perfectly adequate for what you need and want and those other changes which are simpler
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:41.520]   to make and cheaper and easier will help you to get closer to the lifestyle that you imagine.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.720]   So my challenge to you is ask yourself those questions. Take your list of goals and ask
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.760]   yourself why. Why? Why do I want that? Just make sure that you're clear on the reasons
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   and if you want to own one of those beautiful, beautiful earth roamers,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.640]   big fancy RVs, four-wheel drive, you can drive, I mean big expedition vehicles, go for it.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.240]   But if in reality what you want to do is toss a hundred dollar tent to the back of the car
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.280]   and actually spend more time on the road, if that's what you actually want then go for that.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.680]   And I wish you good luck and good success on your planning.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   Shut the show off. I'm out of here. I got to go back and love my family but I'm out of here for
