[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   It was a weekend of street battles and stark displays of racism exploding into a deadly act of domestic terror
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.640]   This summer the city of Charlottesville was the scene of an eruption of racial animosity
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   A sentiment that seems to continue to simmer under the surface of a broader divide in our country
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.760]   And it brings again to the forefront a question over whether racism is the product of nature
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.160]   or nurture
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.040]   Are we born racists or is prejudice something that is wholly learned?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.400]   This question came up recently for a listener named Ryan in Houston
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:49.360]   Pastor John in the wake of recent events this summer in Charlottesville president obama shared this quote from nelson mandela on social media quote
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.160]   No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.920]   People must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.800]   end quote
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.640]   Several news agencies are reporting that this is now the most liked tweet of all time
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.680]   But it seems contrary to the teaching of scripture pastor. John. What are your thoughts on mandela's words here?
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.160]   I have
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   Several thoughts about that quote
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.200]   i've tried to
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   Think about it
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.040]   um
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   in a way
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640]   That could affirm it i'm trying to get inside his skin
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.440]   And think is there is there a way to affirm it?
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.160]   as a christian rather than just
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.520]   my my knee-jerk reaction to bring clear biblical teaching against it, which
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.880]   I'm going to do eventually in a in a way
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.040]   So let me try to to break it down first
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.640]   No one is born
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   Hating another person he says because of the color of his skin
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.360]   Or his background or his religion people must learn to hate now, that's tricky
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   Um, here's a way to defend it
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.720]   When we are born
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   The bible teaches that we have a nature
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   That is rebellious
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   against god 1 corinthians 2 14 says we are
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.720]   Naturally unable to discern spiritual things like the beauty of god and his ways
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.920]   Romans 8 7 and 8 says that by nature we're unwilling and unable to submit to god's
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.120]   Law and to please god ephesians 2 3 says we are by nature
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.680]   Children of wrath that is we are so opposed to god that it is just of god to pour his wrath out
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.200]   Against us romans 3 10 says there's none righteous. No, not one romans 3 23 says we've all
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.760]   Sinned and fallen short of the glory of god psalm 51 5 says
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.840]   We were born in iniquity and in sin did our mothers conceive us now. Here's the catch
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440]   This fallen nature
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.680]   This sinfulness is essentially proud
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.240]   and selfish
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.080]   and self-exalting
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   And resistant to god and what exalts god over all things
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   but the form
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.680]   That this pride and selfishness takes
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.080]   is learned
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.840]   It is it's largely shaped by our parents and our culture
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.240]   one form
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.600]   that this sinfulness can take is hatred toward people who are different from us and being
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.460]   bigoted and angry
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.040]   and
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.680]   Wanting to create as much separation as we can but another form
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.240]   that it can take is a way of
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   Relating that wins the praise of others by doing helpful things for others
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.800]   Even others who are different from us
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   There are many
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.300]   vain
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.740]   selfish
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:28.400]   anti-god people who have learned to treat others with decency and respect because
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.200]   There are very significant advantages to living that way
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   Especially if there's a group of people that you care about who praise that behavior very highly and thus build up your
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800]   Ego while you treat people that way. So yes
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   We do learn to hate
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.960]   In the sense that our parents and our culture
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.900]   channels our natural
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.380]   Segregation into forms of opposition to people like us or
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.820]   we may learn to channel our selfishness into benevolent ways that provide
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.700]   Ego satisfaction for ourselves and win a good deal of praise from other people we admire
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.460]   now the next part of mandela statement says
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.740]   They can be taught to love
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.940]   Now if love here simply means a kind of behavior that gives practical help rather than hurt to others
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.700]   That's true
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.700]   That's what we saw already
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.980]   But that's not what the bible calls love
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.260]   Paul says in first corinthians 13 3 if I give away all I have
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.020]   And deliver up my body to be burned and don't have love
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.380]   I gain nothing
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.260]   so
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.660]   The love that the bible cares about
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.900]   Is not merely giving our goods to the poor
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.100]   Or being willing to sacrifice our bodies
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:08.000]   Love as second corinthians 8 1 and 2 describes starts with being overwhelmed
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.860]   By being loved by god by the grace of god
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.980]   to us in our guilt in our lack of deserving and then
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.840]   Flowing with joy in god to meet the needs of others and draw them into sharing our joy in god
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.820]   Which doesn't just last for 80 years, but for 80 000
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.720]   years
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.080]   even to people
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   Unlike us in fact, especially
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   Jesus says to our enemies we pour out that kind of love the reason it matters to define love
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.680]   As coming from an experience of grace is that without this we perish
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   under god's wrath
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   God has made a way for us to enjoy his favor
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.800]   And if we don't come to christ
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.060]   And confess our lovelessness and receive forgiveness and find our treasure in god himself
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.420]   We will perish under god's punishment
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.880]   and this means
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.240]   That the effort to teach people to act
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.180]   lovingly, but not
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.240]   To love with the love of god not to have the love of god
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:29.720]   Flowing through us because of jesus and the forgiveness of our sins through faith in him to teach people to love without that
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.360]   That effort is not loving
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.200]   because it leaves people lost in their sin and
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.420]   And and that's all covered by a veneer
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.300]   Of good deeds and therefore it's very destructive
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.640]   And finally mandela says
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.760]   For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.240]   if love
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.560]   Simply means doing many beneficial things for people
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.800]   You could see why this might be true
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.360]   for example a mother
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.320]   more naturally feeds her child
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.880]   Than throwing the child over a cliff, right? Almost everybody would agree. It's more natural
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.440]   Most women find it more natural
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.160]   to be nurturing and
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.000]   Feed her infant than to throw him over a waterfall but apart from christ
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.480]   And his saving work
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.420]   that
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.420]   natural love
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.800]   Exists in a heart that is hostile to god does not submit to his law
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.240]   Every one of us has a fundamentally self-exalting heart
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.080]   Which to be sure will do many things that benefit others
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:56.520]   But are no expression of submission to god or desire that others find their joy in god
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.040]   if love
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.540]   As the bible teaches is far more than learned behaviors
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:11.080]   But is the overflow of joy in being forgiven through jesus christ and finding him as our supreme
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.880]   Treasure and desiring that others come and join us in that
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.120]   Everlasting pleasure even at great cost to ourselves then
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.280]   Love does not come naturally to the human heart. It is in fact
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.560]   diametrically opposed to what we are
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.440]   By nature the human heart is proud
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.680]   and selfish
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.280]   and resistant
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   to the authority of god and
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.820]   insubordinate to his commands including
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.880]   The command to love in the power that god supplies for the glory of god. So
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.120]   my prayer
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   for myself
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   And others is that we christians would pursue
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.920]   love in this world
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.400]   by pursuing
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   faith in christ
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.440]   Since whatever is not from faith
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.580]   Is sin romans 14 23
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.680]   And it is unloving
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.160]   To train people to act in ways that look loving
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.960]   But are only sin
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.680]   Yeah, very good. Thank you pastor john for
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   Taking a theme from the news and addressing it for us here on the podcast
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.840]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your day and your commute. We really appreciate that you join us
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.400]   each week
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.700]   well, the 500th birthday of the protestant reformation
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:46.520]   Arrives at the end of october and what a great opportunity for us to reflect on what god has done through luther and calvin
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.820]   And all the many personalities that god used in the protestant reformation
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:00.360]   Those many centuries ago. We have already been celebrating many of those voices at desiring god in a daily series. We call here
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.720]   we stand
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   31 heroes of the reformation

[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.140]   Each day through the month of october. We're publishing a brief daily character sketch of a personality in the reformation
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.240]   And for more details, you can find them at desiringgod.org forward slash stand

[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.440]   And the core convictions that really drove the protestant movement forward
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:41.480]   And then we're going to talk to pastor john about his favorite reformation biographies his book length biographies that he cherishes most
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.520]   And then we will end the week talking with a reformation historian on the the really incredible story of how martin luther
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.780]   Handedly shaped the printing press and the publishing industry as we now know it today
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.100]   It's a really fascinating story and i'm looking forward to sharing it with you
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:04.920]   In about a week that is our trio of episodes next week. I'm your host tony ranke and we will see you then
