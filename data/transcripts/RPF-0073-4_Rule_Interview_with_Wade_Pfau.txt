[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640]   Have you ever heard of the 4% rule for retirement planning?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840]   Have you ever wondered where that came from, what the history is, and
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.600]   what that rule actually means?
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.520]   Today's show is an introduction to the history and the science behind the famed 4% rule.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   [Music]
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.520]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Josh Rasheeds. Today is Wednesday, October the 1st, 2014.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.120]   Today is episode 73 of the show, and we're going to be talking about the 4% rule with Dr. Wade Pfau,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.440]   professor from the American College of Financial Services.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.400]   He knows his stuff, and he's far more qualified to teach you than I am.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.120]   [Music]
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.720]   If you pay any attention to online writings, or if you pay any attention to some financial planning writings,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.920]   you'll often hear about this thing called the 4% rule. And if you don't pay any attention to that stuff, awesome.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   I'm glad you're here. I don't want to pretend that everybody always pays attention to those aspects of
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.120]   the other online financial media. It doesn't really matter. I'm going to introduce you to it today, but
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.960]   through an interview with Dr. Wade Pfau from the American College. And
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.760]   before we do that, I just want to give you some very quick background.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.280]   The 4% rule, I've often mentioned it on the show, and I think it is a useful, very, very useful rule.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.060]   But it's not a panacea. It's not a solution for every retirement planning
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.480]   "whoa" and for every retirement planning question. And the reasons
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.080]   why it's useful, and the reasons why it has problems, are many. And they're complicated.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.320]   And it's very challenging for me to present them all in an overall format.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.400]   They have to be looked at as an individual situation.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.320]   So I've been trying to think about how to bring you some of this more technical content, because it's very challenging to
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   transform a, you know, a 20-page academic paper filled with academic ease and filled with charts and graphs and
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.240]   illustrations into
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.580]   compelling, interesting, and yet accurate and informative audio. Very challenging for me to do.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.400]   But I decided to start by asking Dr. Wade Pfau to come on this show and for us to discuss it.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   And so we're gonna do that in today's show.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.840]   And we're gonna talk about the history behind this. And we're actually celebrating the 20-year anniversary of the original paper that
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.960]   popularized the 4% rule. And in today's interview, you're going to hear some details on it.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   You're gonna understand, I think, a lot more about the 4% rule.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600]   What are the pros and cons? And we're gonna discuss some of the research behind it.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   And I think you'll find it very, very valuable. Very quick introduction to Dr. Wade Pfau.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.320]   He is a PhD, he has a PhD in economics, and he is also a chartered financial analyst,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.680]   which is the gold, in case you're unfamiliar with financial planning designations, the CFA program is very highly regarded for
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.080]   for the integrity, the academic integrity of its research.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   It's very much focused on investment research. And Dr. Wade Pfau holds that charter designation.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.840]   And he spends all of his time now researching the retirement planning
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.040]   situation with the American College, which is the American College for Financial Services, and
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.600]   very involved in the financial services industry. I hope you enjoy the interview. This has been, it was a challenge for me to
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.160]   try to do it in a way that is accessible, but yet also technically accurate.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.320]   And so, but I think we pulled it off, and I think it'll be interesting. That's it. Here's the interview.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.580]   So, Dr. Pfau, thank you for joining us on today's show. I appreciate you making the time in your schedule to join us.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.120]   Sure, my pleasure.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.800]   So, obviously, we're here today to talk primarily about retirement and some of the retirement distribution
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.360]   studies and research that has been done.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.720]   But before we go into that, what I'd like to do is I'd like to introduce you to the audience.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.400]   Would you share with us a little bit about how you got started in your current line of research,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.120]   what your personal background is, and what got you interested in the work that you're now doing in retirement research?
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   Sure. Yeah, well, I grew up in Michigan and Iowa, and then in high school, I
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:24.440]   well, initially just thought I'd always be a scientist, but then discovered economics and really liked economics, decided to major in economics,
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.720]   went to grad school and got a PhD in economics.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.200]   And it took me a while still to discover financial planning. I mean, not that I discovered it, but to find it for myself.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.040]   So, though in graduate school,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:45.080]   my dissertation was about in the 2000s, President Bush had that proposal to create personal retirement accounts,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   which would carve out part of Social Security to create a
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.680]   savings account where people would then be responsible to save for their own retirements rather than relying as much on Social Security.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   And my dissertation was about analyzing that, and that would ultimately tie over to financial planning, though
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.760]   after graduating, I went to Japan. I worked 10 years at a university in Japan teaching economics,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.880]   and at that time was focusing more on the national pension systems of different countries,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.960]   but then had an opportunity to
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.760]   to do research and to submit an article to the Journal of Financial Planning,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:31.200]   got a good reception about that, and ultimately just found that retirement income planning was, it's really interesting to do research in that area.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.720]   It's really important with the public now that there's a lot of interest in retirement planning as more and more people are making that transition.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.200]   And so I really just found my niche then
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.440]   doing the same sort of research I did in my dissertation, which is simulating how different types of strategies
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.160]   will work out over long periods of time with saving for retirement and then retired and how that all works out.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.480]   So now you work as a professor at the American College. So other than that,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.640]   other than your work as a professor, you don't have any,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.560]   you're not running a financial services practice or actively
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.760]   selling any products or consulting with clients, right?
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:18.880]   I joined the American College a year and a half ago, and I do work with a company that provides financial planning software in-stream.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:26.320]   But no, I'm not an active practicing financial planner and also not selling any sorts of financial products.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.240]   Awesome. So as we record this, it is September 29, 2014.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.880]   And where I thought I'd like to start is I'd like to start with you
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.920]   maybe giving a survey of the history of retirement planning research.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   So it's the 20 year anniversary of William Bengen's original article.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   Start with us there.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.600]   Share with us the course of the research that's been done in the academic community
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.480]   over retirement distribution rates over the last 20 years.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.040]   OK, sure. Yeah, William Bengen really got the ball rolling with how the public
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.080]   and financial planners look at retirement income.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.200]   And what he was doing in the 1990s was responding to a really naive way to think about it.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.240]   So the idea going around in the 1990s and still today, if you listen to Dave Ramsey,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.240]   he's he's doing the same thing that the same mistake people are making before.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.080]   And that's just you plug in some return into a spreadsheet.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   So, for example, if you say after inflation, the S&P 500 has averaged about a 7% return.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   So plug in a 7% return into a spreadsheet.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   And then that tells you the safe withdrawal rate is 7% because every year
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.400]   your portfolio goes up 7%, you withdraw 7%.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.720]   You never dip into your principal at all.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   You just could sustain a 7% withdrawal rate forever.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.280]   That's kind of where the discussion was in the 1990s.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.920]   And so Bill Bengen corrected all that.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.640]   He thought that sounded a bit odd, and so he just decided to look at
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.280]   consider a 30 year retirement, so somebody a couple of 65 years old,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.880]   at least one of them living to 95.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   And one of the issues today is people are living longer and longer.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.520]   So 30 years is not so conservative anymore.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.040]   But at the time, that was a relatively conservative time horizon.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.200]   And then he looked at different 30 year periods in history.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.120]   So he looked at 1926 to 1955
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.560]   and then somebody retiring in 1927 through 1956.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.720]   So just looking at these hypothetical individuals in history, retiring each year
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.480]   and trying to figure out what percent of their retirement
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.240]   day assets could they withdraw.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.640]   And then that's giving them an amount of retirement income
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.080]   that they then adjust that income for inflation in each subsequent year
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.960]   and have that strategy be sustainable for at least 30 years.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.200]   And he found that the worst case scenario in history was a 1966
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.560]   hypothetical retiree who could have with a portfolio of 50 to 75%
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.240]   stocks, could have withdrawn just slightly more than 4%
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.400]   of their retirement date assets.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.120]   And that gave us the 4% rule.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.240]   And that what that was doing was introducing a sequence of returns risk
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.160]   that even if somebody's average portfolio return is pretty decent,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.560]   the order that the returns come is really important.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.160]   If somebody has poor market returns early in their retirement
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.480]   and they're trying to fund a constant spending amount,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.720]   they have to withdraw an increasing percentage of what's left in the portfolio.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.960]   Because this is an important point that confuses people.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.400]   The 4% rule is not every year you withdraw 4% of what's left in the portfolio.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.920]   It's just in the first year you withdraw 4%
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   and then you adjust your withdrawals for inflation.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.840]   So if your portfolio is going down in value,
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.920]   you have to withdraw an increasing percentage of what's left
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.800]   to maintain the same spending power.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.720]   And so the sequence of returns risk, if your portfolio is losing value
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.600]   early in retirement, you're withdrawing an increasing percentage of what's left.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.400]   And then you're ultimately digging a hole that can be very hard to get out of.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.320]   And that's why even with higher average returns,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.240]   that the additional volatility created by the order of those returns
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.960]   has caused worst case scenarios in U.S.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.000]   history to fall to around 4%.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   And that so that was now we have the 4% rule
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.320]   at the time that he did that research, he was bringing down the expectations
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.560]   that 7% is not a safe withdrawal rate.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.720]   It's something more like 4%.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.760]   And since then, it really took a while for the research to get going.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   There was the Trinity study in 1998
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.960]   that people, if they start searching about retirement income on the Internet,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.920]   they might see references to the Trinity study.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.560]   But the Trinity study didn't really do anything new.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.840]   It's just people hadn't really heard of Bingen yet when the Trinity study came out.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.920]   It was looking at the same data Bingen looked at.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.240]   But rather than reporting the worst case scenario, it looked at, well,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.040]   if you used a 5% withdrawal rate, what percent of those historical cases
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.160]   would that have worked and so forth?
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.240]   Yeah, I made that an important.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.800]   I made that mistake myself, starting with the Trinity study
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.440]   and instead of with Bingen's.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.040]   So I appreciate your you corrected even me.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.360]   So I appreciate that.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.960]   Oh, sure.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.120]   Yeah, I think, well, the Trinity study, that was it came out in 98,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.280]   right near the peak of the tech bubble.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.920]   And Scott Burns at the Dallas Morning News really picked up on that study
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.200]   and was writing a lot about it.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.800]   And he had a syndicated personal finance column.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.440]   So it's sort of for a lot of people that the first they ever heard of this area
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.000]   was through the Trinity study.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.880]   That's just because it got the media coverage.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.080]   What rates of distribution were retirement planners
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.520]   prior to Bingen's work actually using?
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.440]   Was it the 7% number you referenced?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.560]   Was it higher? Was it lower?
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.200]   Was there any methodology behind it?
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.520]   I don't think there was a lot of methodology.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.640]   This is kind of before my time and we don't I'm interested in this history.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   This is a great question.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.560]   And I've occasionally talked to some planners who were around in those days,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.520]   and I don't think there was any clear methodology
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.280]   in terms of even thinking about sustainable withdrawal rates,
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.080]   because that was such a naive idea that you just plug in the return.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.280]   And that's really where it seems like the state of the art was.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.640]   At that point, planners were still not even using Monte Carlo simulations
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.000]   for the most part.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.440]   They really were just plugging returns into spreadsheets
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.840]   and based in their analysis on that.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.560]   So there wasn't, as far as I can tell, a lot of methodology behind it.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   And that's where Bingen really made that contribution that kind of
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.960]   helped set up the revolution of now financial planners
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.320]   using Monte Carlo simulations.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.640]   Bingen wasn't using Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.880]   but he was using a similar type of idea of let's look at just different
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   historical periods, which is getting at the same sort of issue of
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.120]   there's a lot of variability and how do we account for that variability to get
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.600]   get better results for our analysis? And that's
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.640]   that's what planners are doing today that I don't think they were doing
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.600]   all that much prior to Bingen.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.840]   My guess is also if we were and I'd be interested in the history as well.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.680]   This is just a guess from my reading in the investment arena.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.240]   But my guess is that planners prior to that time, at least if they were
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.800]   knowledgeable, were probably focusing more heavily on dividends.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.640]   Historically, there's been a shift that I've observed of a shift
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.280]   away from paying dividends by corporations that used to be
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.720]   kind of how the value of your stocks were primarily measured.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.920]   Nowadays, with the with the more problematic
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.520]   taxation of dividends, many companies have shifted away from focusing on dividends.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.720]   So I think that was historically more important.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.240]   Also, with the I guess
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.920]   prime with the large defined benefit programs that were available,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.840]   I think a financial planner's job, it would have been unusual, my guess,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.360]   to try to put everything based upon a portfolio of stocks and bonds,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.280]   because usually a planner may have had a defined benefit plan,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.680]   a pension income, a Social Security stream of income,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.240]   and then also maybe other assets as well.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.000]   Whereas I think over the last 20 years, there's been such a marked decline
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.600]   in the defined benefit pension plans that now a planner is
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.840]   probably having to put a lot more emphasis
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.440]   on the portfolio of stocks and bonds to provide retirement income.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.320]   That'd be my guess.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.200]   But I think that's a good point, and Vanguard had a study about that as well,
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.920]   that for a lot of this historical period,
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.280]   just the dividends and interest coming from a portfolio without even making any
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.800]   effort to try to strive to get higher yields, higher dividends or
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.040]   or higher yields from bonds.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.840]   But you're getting four or five, six or seven percent
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.800]   yield from a basic portfolio, kind of focused on a total returns
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.520]   portfolio for much of that historical period.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.680]   So I think that's a good point, that you could sustain
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.240]   those kinds of spending rates just with the income from a portfolio until
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.760]   just the more recent years where dividend rates have fallen so low
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.680]   and interest rates are now so low.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   Right. Yeah, I think you're making a good point there.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.440]   And this, I think, is a big deal as to why historically there's been such a focus
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   on shifting the portfolio from stocks to bonds, because traditionally
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.800]   bonds were how you drew income from a portfolio.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.280]   You had your coupon payments, you had your defined yield.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.240]   You knew what it was going in.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.320]   And so that stability of income reflected, was reflected in your plan.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.920]   That was the income that you based that on.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.080]   Well, it's much more challenging in 2014
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   when your yield on your bond portfolio, the stated yield is quite low
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.000]   and you need to go beyond that to provide your level of income.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.640]   And so there are some of these macroeconomic changes
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.280]   have had made a big difference in the work of a financial planner
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.360]   to apply to an individual situation.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.920]   Mm hmm. Yeah, it becomes much more expensive to support.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.240]   A retirement income from a fixed income portfolio with interest rates so low.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.960]   So if you're going that route, you'd have to devote a lot more of your assets to it.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.080]   And yeah, it's just it's tough in this environment.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   Extremely tough.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.720]   So after Bingen, then where has the research gone?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.160]   Trace the thread for us.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.320]   We're looking at four different key financial planning studies
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.400]   since Bingen, there was in 2001,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   various and Mark Warshawski and John Amarik
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.520]   had a study in the Journal of Financial Planning
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.400]   that looked at how partially annuitizing with a with an income annuity,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.560]   a single premium, immediate annuity could help increase the sustainability
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.200]   the sustainability of a retirement portfolio.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.800]   So that was the key study that would lead further down the line
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.000]   to some more developments.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.400]   And then I think the next pivotal study came in.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.560]   It's actually I just realized this last week in October 2004.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.160]   So exactly 10 years after Bingen, 10 years ago from now,
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.240]   Jonathan Guyton and his initial study in the Journal of Financial Planning
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   about how to adjust spending.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.800]   So one of the issues with the 4% rule and with the bank,
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.960]   I mean, Bingen was just trying to create a framework to explain
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.000]   why 7% is not a safe withdrawal rate.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.080]   I don't think it was ever meant to serve as a retirement income strategy,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.440]   but with its popularity in the press and everything,
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.320]   it kind of became the de facto strategy.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.240]   Right. And it's a strategy where you don't really adjust your spending,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.200]   even if your portfolio is declining,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.600]   because you're essentially playing a game of chicken
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.040]   and hoping that your portfolio is not going to run out.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.280]   But but Jonathan Guyton looked more carefully at the idea that, well,
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.680]   if your portfolio is losing value, you might want to cut your spending.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   And if your portfolio is growing because 4% is supposed to be
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.920]   a conservative spending rate, that's supposed to work in the worst case scenario.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   So in other cases, your portfolio is going to continue to grow.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.200]   And at some point you can increase your spending.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.840]   And Jonathan Guyton precisely 10 years ago published an article
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.440]   where he developed guardrails and decision rules to kind of set parameters that.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.920]   To to define when you can go ahead and increase your spending
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.680]   or when you should actually take action and decrease your spending.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.000]   And he wrote how.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.280]   If you're willing to make cuts in your spending,
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.520]   you can go ahead and start with a higher spending rate
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.040]   and having that flexibility reduces some of the sequence of returns risk.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.960]   So it actually.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.160]   Can potentially let you have a higher initial withdrawal rate and.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.840]   Not not necessarily ever have to cut your spending below
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.360]   where it would have otherwise been if you were following the straightforward 4% rule.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.480]   So did that study have an impact on some of the alternative strategies
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.520]   that we've built out, for example, the floor approach,
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.240]   you know, where we say, OK, as long as we've got this basis,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.160]   then we can adjust the discretionary spending on top of that.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.720]   Was that study a major influencer on some of the techniques we developed?
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:26.080]   No, I would say no to that, and that kind of gets to another issue
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.320]   that there's actually two completely distinct schools of thought
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.440]   about retirement income.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.720]   And what I call the probability based approach
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.240]   would encompass Bingen's work and Guyton's work
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.640]   where there's not really a distinct floor or Michael Kitsies,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.560]   who's a really popular blogger and financial planner in Maryland.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.760]   He he makes the statement that the 4% rule is a floor with upside approach.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.760]   But for people who are focused on flooring,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   they are horrified by that kind of statement, because with the safety
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.680]   first school, when you're building an income floor,
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   you don't use a total returns investment portfolio
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.960]   because you don't want to have any stocks in the portion of the portfolio meant
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.720]   to provide that for the floor.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.600]   It needs to be provided through fixed income,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.720]   which bonds being held to their maturity dates or with income annuities.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.360]   There's not a room for stocks in that floor.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.400]   And the Guyton approach
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.920]   is a probability based.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.840]   You're using a total returns investment strategy, and there really is no floor
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   because if there's really bad markets, if the stock market's doing terrible,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.800]   you're going to have to keep cutting the spending.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.200]   And and I mean, there's.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.920]   Any time you try to have a floor,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   so to speak, with with stocks, then that's going to be a floor
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.560]   that's at risk and may not work out.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.000]   And Jonathan Guyton, as well as one of the leading advocates of the idea that.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.520]   These sorts of probability based approaches are superior to the floor
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.680]   and upside approaches,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.400]   because with the floor, the upside approach,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.520]   especially with the interest rates so low today,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.720]   it's very expensive to lock in that floor with dedicated assets.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.640]   And so he he thinks that ultimately
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.280]   people might have to reduce their spending more,
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.320]   even though they have that basic floor in place.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.880]   They may never get the chance to meet their discretionary expenses
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.560]   because they've just had to put so much effort into building that basic floor.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.120]   And he would prefer or he thinks clients are going to be much happier
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.160]   with a total returns approach that has that flexibility and not.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.960]   And that allows stocks to be used for any part of the portfolio.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.000]   Well, this is where I mean, I see a big difference.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.440]   Yeah, it's it does help.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.480]   And one of the frustrations I have as a planner
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.600]   is that you have to individualize this for clients.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:06.560]   So some clients may have a tremendous history with investing in stocks.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.240]   They may have a comfort level with the volatility,
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.000]   and they may have an implicit faith and confidence in the total return strategy.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.360]   History, in my opinion, history would demonstrate that
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.280]   the growth of companies and the growth of equities has been one of the most
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.560]   powerful wealth production machines of all time.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.080]   And I don't see a lot of compelling evidence to say that
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.880]   there are major things that are going to change that.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.440]   It just seems to me like that's what history has shown.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.240]   So and I don't see again, I don't see any reason why to discount that going forward.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.600]   Now, relatively speaking, it may be higher or less.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.440]   And that's one of the things I'm going to cover in a few minutes with you.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.320]   But but that so but that it takes a while to get to that kind of comfort level
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.480]   with stocks, and many people are simply not comfortable.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.680]   And so the development of something like a floor approach where,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   just to clarify for the listening audience, my understanding of what I would use
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.080]   with a floor approach would be to say, what's the minimum level of income
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.320]   that you need to maintain the minimum level of lifestyle
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   that you're willing to to live on, whether that's needs versus wants
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.240]   or discretionary versus essential, however you characterize those differences
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.720]   of income, we would set a floor in place, whether with Social Security income,
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   income annuities, as you mentioned, yield off of a fixed income portfolio,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.960]   whatever that that base is.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.880]   And then we would invest for a higher return on top of that.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.560]   Well, that gives the client the confidence of knowing that no matter what,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.600]   I always have at least this amount of money to spend.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.160]   That's much more intuitive.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.520]   In my experience, that's much more intuitive with with clients
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:46.160]   and how we as ordinary individuals think about our expenses.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.000]   And so it seems like that resonates more with clients than does the idea
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.760]   of a total returns portfolio and massive volatility and massive fluctuations does.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.800]   But yet, scientifically speaking, it seems that any study I've read so far,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   and tell me if there's some that I haven't that disagree with this,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.920]   but the greater the percentage of your portfolio that's allocated to equities,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   the higher the total wealth over time, simply because of that massive difference
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.280]   between the productivity of companies versus other investments.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.840]   So there's a challenge between what is intuitive for clients
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.720]   in their situation versus what the academic literature might say.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.440]   Mm hmm. Yeah, I think one.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.640]   So different advisors and different clients will look at this differently.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.320]   And one way to kind of a litmus test is now that a lot of financial planners
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.880]   are using Monte Carlo simulations, they run the plan and they tell the client
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.440]   your plan has a 90 percent chance for success.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.320]   So if you're comfortable with that, then that means you're probability based,
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   that you're willing to go with that total returns investment approach.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.840]   90 percent chance that it's going to work.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.520]   If it looks like you might be on a path where it's not going to work,
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.000]   you might have to make some small adjustments, but things should generally be OK.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.120]   So if the client's comfortable with that, then then that total returns
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.760]   approach is right for them.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.200]   But if they're more focused on a 90 percent chance for success
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.600]   means there's a 10 percent chance for failure.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.640]   There's a 10 percent, 10 percent chance
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.480]   you're going to run out of money before the end of your projected lifetime.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.880]   And if they really focus on that and are really, I mean, that's frightening
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.280]   and causes them to lose sleep and everything,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.480]   then that's where the safety first approach comes in.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.440]   And that's where you do this.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.120]   Yeah. As you're saying, it's more logical for the client.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.280]   It's an asset liability matching that you're going to match your assets
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.000]   to your spending needs so that you have similar risk characteristics
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.560]   and that you're not going to have stocks in the part of the portfolio
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.200]   that's meant to cover your basic needs.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.520]   And so then no matter what, that kind of safety first approach,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.640]   you really build in that secure floor.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.480]   And that might be costly so that you may have less upside potential at that point.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.280]   But if that's helping an individual to sleep better at night, then that
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.200]   then that's the appropriate approach for them.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.080]   Could you explain, please, what a Monte Carlo simulation is
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   and how it works and why it's useful?
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.560]   Oh, sure. Right.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   So the alternative to Monte Carlo simulation is you
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.240]   you put together a spreadsheet and you just plug in a rate of return
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   for the portfolio.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.480]   So you just every year, if you say the portfolio is going to give you a six
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.800]   percent return, then every year you just have the assets go by six percent.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.600]   And then you figure out,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.520]   well, have you run out of money by a particular date in the future?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.640]   So Monte Carlo simulations were originally developed
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.440]   in the 1940s as a part of the effort in World War
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.000]   two of trying to introduce randomness into
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.080]   well, into the analysis.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.800]   So maybe the average return on the portfolio could be six percent.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.480]   But there's volatility, just like the stock market.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.280]   There is volatility.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.920]   Some years there may be a 20 percent return.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.440]   Other years there might be a negative 20 percent return.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.080]   And what Monte Carlo simulations do and they've really it's just.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.000]   Well, there was a famous article in 1997 in the Journal of Financial Planning
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.800]   telling advisors to wake up and start using Monte Carlo simulations.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.680]   And then in the 2000s.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.600]   Now, these days, most every financial planning software is going to offer it.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.280]   What it's doing is just providing a whole range of outcomes.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.160]   So you may have 10,000 simulations of what could the market
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.200]   returns look like in each simulation over the retirement?
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.920]   If they're even if they average six percent, but some years are up,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.200]   some years are down and you just draw randomly.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.040]   You're just random draws of a return
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   that's based around some average return with some degree of volatility
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.120]   around that return projected out over 30 or 40 years or whatever the case may be.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.640]   But each of these 10,000 simulations will have that
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.560]   a 30 or four year sequence, 30 or 40 year sequence of market returns
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.800]   based on the characteristics you've defined.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.320]   And then you get the whole range of outcomes.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.800]   And then you could say something like what I mentioned earlier,
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.200]   that 90 percent chance for success means.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.560]   If you had these 10,000 simulations in 9000 cases, the plan would have worked
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.600]   in 1000 cases, the plan would have run out of money before the end.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.640]   So it didn't work.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.120]   And that's what the Monte Carlo simulations are doing.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.400]   They're giving you more about the distribution and the probabilities
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.840]   associated with different outcomes
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.960]   rather than basing everything on just one fixed return.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.840]   And then one answer, did the plan run out of money or not?
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.280]   When you define the plan not working, one of the things that to me is important
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   and about about a Monte Carlo simulation is to understand
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.360]   what it means when it says the plan doesn't work.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.120]   And this is the difference between kind of statistically stress
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.480]   testing it with a Monte Carlo simulation versus a real person in a real situation.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.640]   And a Monte Carlo analysis, it's basically saying, can I sustain
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.000]   this level of expenses, this level of income off of the portfolio
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.160]   over this period of time, given these random variables
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.520]   and in input of rates of return, inflation rates, et cetera?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.600]   And so failure is simply defined as not being able to sustain that level of income.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.480]   That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that a human being
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.960]   couldn't maintain some level of income and couldn't adjust their expenses
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.200]   as time goes forward, depending on what their retirement distributions look like.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.920]   Is that accurate?
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.640]   Right, that's accurate.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.200]   That's and that's kind of one of the side effects of that Trinity study
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.440]   that set everything up as success rates and failure rates.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.320]   Failure means that for the plan, you've set some kind of maximum age.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.600]   So if you say, I want this plan to work through age 95.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.960]   Well, if the portfolio is depleted at any point before age 95,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.160]   you would call that a failure, even if it was age 94 or even if it was age 67.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.360]   It doesn't make any distinction.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.960]   And then you're right. It doesn't consider partial income.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.480]   So people will still have Social Security.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.920]   They'll still have any defined benefit pensions.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.240]   If they decided to buy an income annuity, they still have income
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.160]   from the income annuity.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.360]   And so failure can mean something very different.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.280]   It simply means the financial portfolio, the portfolio of stocks
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.600]   and bonds has been depleted.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   But that doesn't necessarily mean the person doesn't have any spending power left.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.400]   And it also if it happened, if they just missed their spending goal
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.080]   by one dollar in the final year, it counts as failure.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.000]   But that's really not much of a problem.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.720]   And as well, you're right, you could also make adjustments to spending, which.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.000]   Which can be accounted for, and that's I'm now working with a financial
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.800]   planning software company that's going to let you do this, to have.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   Spending rules where you can adjust your spending
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.320]   based on what's happening in the markets.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.560]   If you put a hard floor in where the different meaning of the floor,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.440]   like if you say, I'm never going to let the spending fall below
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.480]   fifty thousand dollars a year, you could still fail
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.400]   because you're forced, you're going to then play that game of chicken.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   But if you don't have any kind of hard floor like that, where you're really
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.760]   going to just let your spending be completely flexible.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.000]   Well, in that case, you never run out of money, though
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.840]   you may have your spending fall to very low levels.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.720]   But right, that's all part of we need to have more sophisticated ways
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.600]   of measuring the quote unquote success or failure in terms of
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.960]   how much are you missing the spending go by or how much did you have to cut
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.000]   your spending or when did your portfolio run out and how much income do you have
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.640]   left, even if your financial assets are depleted and so forth?
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.440]   It's very just one simple measure.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.280]   Right.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.200]   I love practicing and retirement planning, but I also find it to be
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.880]   one of the most challenging areas to practice in.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.520]   And here is something that I've observed just in my personal experience.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.200]   We as human beings, I think we desire certainty.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.440]   We desire a sense of certainty.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.600]   And then especially when it comes to finance,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.160]   we desire a real sense of knowledge of this is going to work.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.400]   And this is there is a sense of certainty around it.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.080]   And in the in developing the science of financial planning,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.440]   I think one of the places that we probably go too far sometimes with
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.120]   as practitioners is we're trying to deliver.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.360]   A sense of certainty in scenarios that are inherently uncertain,
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.640]   and so when a client is looking, so there are so many assumptions
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.360]   and I'm going to cover them in a few minutes,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.120]   I want to talk about some of the assumptions that go into these formulas
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.280]   or into these studies, even.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.400]   But there are so many assumptions upon which a financial plan is built.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.680]   That there are many things that can happen that can cause a failure,
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.640]   divided in the in the Monte Carlo sense of not being able to maintain the full
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.920]   the full plan.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:20.080]   And it's much less about the science of here is a number or here is what
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.400]   here is a plan that's going to work in every situation.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.960]   It's much less about that than it is about having the ability to react
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.600]   and respond to changes in market conditions, to changes in financial conditions,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.240]   to the general macroeconomy or to an individual's microeconomy.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.000]   And I've come to the conclusion in the research I've done
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.280]   and just kind of thinking it through,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.000]   people are often looking for the certainty of what's my number.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.440]   And I've come to the conclusion that there is no number.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.680]   There is no one number.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.640]   There's just simply for each person, there's an initial,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.800]   there's a comfort level with what risks you're willing to bear
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.200]   and what risks you're not willing to bear and what is failure and what is success.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.200]   And there is no number that you can that you can point to and say,
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.080]   here's your number.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   What say you?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah, I think that's absolutely right, that people always need to stay flexible.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.280]   And again, with the work Bingen did and then with the Trinity study,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.480]   it was a case of just putting together some simplifying assumptions.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.840]   And if you just read the research too literally,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.520]   it's a set it and forget it approach that you just determine
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.000]   what percent of your retirement day assets you can spend
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.400]   and then just go with that forever without making any adjustments at any point.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.240]   And of course, in reality, that's not the way to go.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.400]   And that's where we've but but the Bingen work,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.320]   well, Bingen subsequently did more work with the Trinity study
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.640]   didn't offer any suggestion about how to make those adjustments.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.600]   And that's where we've had new research filling in some of those gaps.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.400]   The Trinity authors did in 2011.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.960]   Republish their basic results, and then.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.760]   This is something like every five or 10 years,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.000]   you should reset your withdrawal rate based on.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.400]   Your new age and your new asset level, but it still wasn't very sophisticated.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.200]   But but yeah, definitely, it's really a process of.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.760]   Revisiting the plan, making adjustments.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Seeing if the spending still seems to be on track or if maybe
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.280]   it's getting to be too high of a level and then as well,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.880]   that's so Jonathan Guyton talks about the withdrawal policy statement.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.960]   That's like an investment policy statement that and the investment policy
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.800]   statement, you you write down what you're going to do with what's your asset
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.960]   allocation, write down that you're not going to panic and sell all your stocks
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.120]   if the market declines and so forth.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.840]   Well, the withdrawal policy statement is a set of rules.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.720]   OK, here's the conditions where you're going to cut your spending.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.320]   If if there's a big market drop one day, you don't have to panic.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.400]   You don't have to suddenly cut your spending 50 percent.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.120]   There's a there's a framework in place for how to make these adjustments
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.800]   and how to monitor what's going on with the portfolio.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.320]   And just, yeah, that's part of that being flexible,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.360]   but having a process in place so that you don't overreact.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.200]   Was it being ready to?
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.880]   I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.320]   Excuse me. I was going to say, was it the Trinity study where?
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.480]   And this was a statistic that that I just learned
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:31.320]   that I had not I hadn't grasped this, but was it the Trinity study
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.920]   that showed that based upon a four percent withdrawal rate,
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:41.080]   that 96 percent of the portfolios wound up with at the end of the term,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.520]   at the end of the 30 year term, they wound up with the same amount of
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.800]   in nominal terms, the same amount of investment assets that they started with.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.520]   Was that the Trinity study that showed that?
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.920]   No, that wasn't the Trinity study that
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.720]   actually I was involved in that number a little bit,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.800]   because William Bengen developed that number for a financial advisor
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.160]   article that he wrote in 2012.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.120]   And then I wrote a blog post saying, yeah, that's that's I checked it out.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.720]   And that's right.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   But historically, 96 percent of the time with the four percent
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:21.200]   rule, you'd still have in nominal terms just as much wealth as what you started with.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.600]   But then I said, that's actually not the best way to think about it.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.080]   You should be thinking about an inflation adjusted terms, right?
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.200]   That if your wealth stays at the same level after inflation.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.880]   And in that case, it's about 50 percent of the time.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.280]   But then Michael Kitsie has really jumped on that number.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.680]   And I think he promoted that he uses that ninety six percent number
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.080]   in his presentations, even today still. And.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   And and that's the ninety six percent from the Trinity study, though, is.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.920]   But that number shows up there as well in more recent versions
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.000]   that they say the four percent will have a ninety six percent success rate.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.280]   Right. That. And with Bingen, it was 100 percent success rate.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.640]   But what happened was they switched the bonds
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.560]   rather than using the intermediate term government bonds.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.200]   They switched to long term corporate bonds.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.440]   And in that case, the four percent rule just missed working in 1965 and 1966.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.880]   So in their initial study, the four percent will had a ninety five percent
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.600]   success rate. But now that we've added more data over time,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.400]   you get a ninety six percent success rate.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.840]   It's interesting just because it shows what I learned
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.320]   by doing Monte Carlo simulations is I found the variability
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.920]   of potential returns from Monte Carlo simulations to be so incredibly massive.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.040]   So you would I would do one scenario and there would be one sequence of returns
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   where the client wound up with dying,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.760]   you know, spending at their their their desired level of income
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.200]   and dying with a portfolio of 20 million dollars for, you know,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.520]   just a middle class, mass affluent client.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.280]   And then but they had a 22 percent failure rate.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.440]   And, you know, it's zero money and the plan not working
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.320]   and then completely spending the money.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.720]   And to me, when I started looking at those, the range of potential outcomes,
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.000]   it really just knocked me back because I had never realized
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.200]   what a big difference the market returns, the sequence of the market returns
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.600]   and then the actual market returns could make on a portfolio.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.640]   And it just illustrates that even it illustrates the point.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.280]   And the thing I like about the ninety six percent
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.120]   where you start the retirement and a ninety six percent of the cases,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.000]   you start the retirement with a million dollars, you withdraw on a four percent.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.240]   And at the end of 30 years, you still have the million dollars,
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.280]   same million dollars in nominal terms, not adjusted.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.960]   I think that illustrates how.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.720]   I guess the impact of those returns, because to me, that was shocking
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.680]   when I when I grasped that data, because I say, wow,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.960]   I could still have the million dollars.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.680]   So the mind would immediately go and react and say, well, the four percent rule
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.160]   is golden, ninety six percent of the time it's going to work.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.600]   But then what about the other times where it doesn't work?
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.040]   And that can be in many that can be useful, but it can also be very misleading.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.920]   And to me, one of the things that I've taken away from the research
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.080]   I've been doing is the need for flexibility.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   If a client is flexible as far as where they're willing to allocate
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   their portfolio and flexible in their spending rates,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.200]   a whole range of solutions can open up and we can apply some intelligent
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.600]   strategies to the distribution where there can be an amazing,
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.360]   you know, much higher distribution because of the flexibility.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.280]   Have you have you observed that?
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.040]   Am I right in that or am I off base with with with your research?
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.120]   Right. You're right that with Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.800]   you get such a huge range of outcomes and you're right about that.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.440]   And some of those best case scenarios,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.760]   your wealth grows 20 or 30 times over the retirement period.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.640]   But well, and the other point about that ninety six percent number was
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.080]   to try to really highlight that the four percent rule is meant to be conservative.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.040]   It's it's supposed to work in the worst case scenario. Right.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.360]   And what that number is telling you is, you know, hey, in ninety six percent
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.160]   of the cases, you actually don't end up dipping into your principle,
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   more or less after the end of 30 years.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.920]   And yeah, I mean, that's.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.760]   So there's a huge range of you could become incredibly wealthy, but and you
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.800]   typically you're not going to be dipping into your principle,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.960]   the four percent rule is conservative.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.920]   But right there are those cases where the four percent rule may not work
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.840]   and you do have to be flexible.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.280]   I'm excited about the work that that you're doing
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.080]   and then some of the other academics are doing.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.840]   And I'm especially excited about some of the work.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   I'm not sure if you pay much attention to the online, the early retirement
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.680]   community. And on one hand, I love the four percent rule
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.040]   because I think it's very useful.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.600]   But on the other hand, I really feel as though
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.640]   we need to learn a little bit more about it.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.240]   So I think the four percent rule is a very useful rule of thumb.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.200]   Excuse me, thumb, because it's straightforward.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.160]   It's easily understood.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.200]   You need twenty five times your annual expenses.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   And if you have twenty five times your annual expenses
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.840]   in a diversified portfolio, you're probably going to be well suited.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.960]   But I answered a question from a reader the other day, and I just said,
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.280]   if you're looking for me to the reader was thirty five, excuse me,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.120]   listener was thirty five years old and said, I hate my job.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.840]   I want to retire.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.640]   And I've got basically a million dollars of assets. Can I afford it?
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.360]   And I said, if you expect me to feel confident telling you that, yes,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.120]   you're going to be able to retire at thirty five years old and spend
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.800]   spend off of this four percent rule for the rest of your life.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.240]   I'm very uncomfortable with that.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.120]   But if we can bring in added flexibility, if you're willing during a time of
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.040]   of low market returns, if you're willing to go and add some part time income
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.280]   or willing to make a dramatic change in your spending, then yes,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.800]   this can be a really useful starting point.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.920]   And I think that we owe a great debt to to Bingen and the Trinity guys
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.320]   for popularizing this, because I think it's given people
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.600]   a much more conservative estimate for how they can do their own
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.760]   their own retirement planning, at least as a starting point.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.800]   It gives them a number to shoot for.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.160]   So I think it's very useful.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.720]   But also we've got to keep doing the research around it like we've been doing.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.400]   Yeah, and it definitely is a lot more realistic.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.600]   Because Dave Ramsey and his radio show today still talking about the eight
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.320]   percent safe withdrawal rate, 100 percent stocks.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.240]   And that's something that Bingen figured out for us back in the 1990s.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.000]   It's just wrong.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.920]   Yeah, that one is just so dangerous.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.760]   And it's flat out.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.640]   I'm very uncomfortable with that.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.320]   And I have I have had clients in my office
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.440]   telling me that saying, look, I can do eight percent, both on retirement
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.320]   and also based off of life insurance analysis,
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.560]   because he gives the same advice for life insurance analysis.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.920]   You need ten eight to ten times your income.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.200]   Twelve percent returns pull off four percent for inflation.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.000]   You can you can take your eight percent.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.920]   You can take your eight percent distribution.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.520]   And I sit there and I scratch my head and I say, do you realize
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.440]   how nuts that scenario is in the real world?
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.680]   So I'm glad that you are pointing out it out from an academic perspective.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.920]   The danger in that.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.320]   What I'd like to talk about is I'd like to talk about some of the assumptions
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.800]   that are inherent in the research that you're doing.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.160]   And here's one thing that does get me very nervous.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.280]   I get very nervous that all of this is based upon a
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.920]   all of the research that we've been doing in this scenario
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.040]   is based upon the data that we have over the last, say, since accurate data
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.440]   since the late 1920s. Right.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.000]   And I'm concerned about taking those results
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.120]   and projecting them forward to the future.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:55.640]   And although I don't necessarily feel like we have to throw those results out,
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.720]   I certainly don't think that I think it's naive to do all of our driving
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.680]   by looking in the rearview mirror and
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:08.040]   and not looking forward and say and recognizing that it's possible
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.000]   that the future does look different than the past.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.480]   It's possible that we do have different economic growth rates.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.440]   It's possible that as we look at some of the economic challenges,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.800]   that the future may look different and that would dramatically affect these.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.560]   Models that we use.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.200]   What thoughts do you have on my concern about looking at backward
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.160]   looking assumptions? Right.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.080]   Yeah, my my very first article that I published in the Journal of Financial
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.640]   Planning was I had a there's now 20 countries, 20 developed market countries
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.480]   where we have the financial data going back to 1900.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.720]   And just looking at with the 4% rule have worked in all these other countries.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.640]   And basically it would have worked in the US and Canada.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.880]   But there's there's a lot of well, I forget the number like.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.200]   At the aggregate level, I think the 4% rule has about a 66% success rate
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.240]   historically across all these countries, such that part of the problem is just
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.720]   we're dealing with in the 20th century, the US became the world's leading superpower
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.160]   and the world US stock market capitalization.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.280]   That was about 20%.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.440]   The US stock market was about added up to 20% of the total world stock market in 1900.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.240]   And it was like 50% in 2000.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.960]   And in those kinds of circumstances.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.080]   The US, it's a really unique time in world history where a country grew so rapidly
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:40.000]   in such a short period of time, and it's not even being pessimistic about the future
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.640]   of the US, you can still be optimistic, but still say maybe in the 21st century,
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.320]   we're going to have a bit more average type of performance with our equity markets,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:56.560]   in which case just that alone means 4% is not going to be as safe as it looked in
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.800]   US historical data.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.760]   So you're right about that.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:07.320]   It's the 4% rule is just based on US historical data since, well, banking used
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.400]   since 1926.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.000]   And we do have Robert Shiller data on his website goes back to 1871.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.760]   The 4% rule did work in that older period as well.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.720]   But that's what it's based on.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.880]   It's a relatively short period in world history.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.520]   Right.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.960]   And it's, and like you said, it's a, it's a period of, of tremendous growth.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:31.840]   And one of the major concerns that I have is that in all of my formal training as a
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.200]   financial advisor, the training that I received to pass the government licensing
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.600]   exams, the training that I received to pass the, you know, my, my firm's elements,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.720]   you know, financial planning education, the majority of the, the information that
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.880]   we study is based from a US American centric context.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.680]   And so if you were to ask me, what is the average return of the general US stock
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.560]   market over the last a hundred years, I got an easy answer.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.040]   I know that, but I don't have any idea about what the average return of the
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.120]   major German companies has been or the major English companies have been.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:13.680]   And by putting a historical lens to, to the world and looking at it and
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.040]   recognizing that we have had a history of, of time in the United States that has
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.120]   been massive growth, that it seems that US America, many US American companies
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.800]   have had major successes on a global scale, but yet looking at the trends and
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.760]   the forces that, you know, the US American economy, that the individual
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.240]   companies are doing very well.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.520]   But if you look at how much of the money is kept offshore because of the, the US
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.280]   tax policy, if you look at the changes with the corporate, the, you know, some
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.200]   of these corporate inversions that are gaining news, that are hitting the news
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.680]   now, I think that's a trend that's only just beginning.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.760]   I could be wrong about that, but that's a trend that's only just beginning.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:50:00.200]   And the major economic headwinds of, you know, basically to use professor
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:05.320]   Kotlikoff's numbers from Boston, from Boston college, $222 trillion of
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.840]   unfunded liabilities and national debt facing the US American economy.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.840]   It's hard for me to see how the future won't look different than the past.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.040]   Now, what it looks like, I don't know, but it's hard for me to see how the
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.600]   future won't look a little bit different.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.840]   And then you must've experienced that.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.440]   You said you taught in Japan for 10 years.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.200]   That's always the example that is cited in, in financial markets.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.480]   It's hard for me to feel so confident about the 4% rule, looking
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.680]   at some of those headwinds.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:36.360]   Yeah, I think fair enough.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.840]   And just so, well, to give you the answer that William Bengen would, would give
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.720]   for that is yeah, all that may be true, but if you look at this US historical
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.560]   period, it had the great depression and it had the stagflation of the 1970s and so on.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.880]   And the 4% rule had survived through all of that.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:00.040]   So in that regard, there's some precedent that we could rely on it in the future.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.640]   But no, I agree with you.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.800]   I think that the US historical period is not enough.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.520]   And there's all these things that could be different in the future.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.080]   And just simply looking at the fact that in other countries, results varied.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.880]   Yeah, the US equity markets in the 20th century, basically with that data set,
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:22.480]   Australia was the only country that had a higher stock return and
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.320]   less stock volatility than the US.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.160]   There are a couple other countries that had higher average stock
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.040]   returns, but much more volatility.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   So a much lower compounded return.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:37.160]   And then all the rest of those countries were lower, mostly lower.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.720]   Well, Canada had a lower return, but less volatility than most every other
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.600]   country was lower returns and more volatility.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.320]   The US really came out of that right near the top of the heap.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:54.520]   And with Australia, even in Australia's case, the 4% rule didn't work.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:01.240]   They, in the stagflation they experienced in the 1970s, 3% ended up being a much
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:06.080]   more realistic number than 4%, even though they had a better equity market
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:13.400]   performance. And I'll give Bangan his Great Depression data, but I would
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:19.760]   observe and I would say that the United States of America of 2014 is different
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.720]   in many ways than the United States of America in 1914.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.760]   There's a dramatically different culture.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.080]   There's a dramatically different socioeconomic context.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.120]   There's dramatically different costs, embedded costs for doing business.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:38.080]   And I mean, I'm happy to give him the 4%, but it certainly seems to me that we
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.000]   live in a very different world than we did back then, a world that is much
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.600]   better in many ways, much greater access to life enhancing technology, a much
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.320]   higher standard of living for the average person, and yet a world that is
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.840]   dramatically different and has many more embedded costs in 2014.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.280]   And so I don't know how to reconcile those things.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.200]   Right. And some other research I've been involved with, with David Blanchard
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   and Michael Finca, was looking at how well low bond yields mean lower future
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.040]   bond returns, which imply a lower withdrawal rate.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.400]   As we were kind of talking about earlier, when interest rates are so low, it's
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.800]   very difficult to get income from the portfolio.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.960]   You have to spend some of the principal.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.200]   And then Robert Shiller has the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio,
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.120]   which is a ratio of how highly stocks are valued, are they overvalued or
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.720]   undervalued, and it's currently at levels that are right up near the highest in
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:42.560]   history, only exceeded right before the great depression, Robert Shiller's PE10
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.320]   had a higher value, and then it had a significantly higher value in the late
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.600]   1990s, as we had that lead up to the bursting of the tech bubble.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.120]   But we're now at a point where we don't have much experience with such low bond
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.560]   yields and high stock market valuations at the same time.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.880]   The only other time that happened was 1898, 1899 and 1900.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.960]   So we really are in this sort of uncharted water.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.080]   Higher stock valuations mean lower expected future stock returns and lower
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.280]   sustainable withdrawal rates.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   So high valuations, low bond yields, it's sort of uncharted water with that, even
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.000]   though the thing about the great depression was there was dramatic
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.240]   deflation and also the real return on bonds doubled in the 10 years between
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.040]   1929 and 1939.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.120]   So even the stock market performed so abysmally.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.320]   Bonds were doing great.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.280]   Deflation meant when you're testing the 4% rule, rather than having to increase
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.320]   spending each year, you actually get to decrease spending each year because of
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.640]   the deflation in the economy.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:53.320]   So the 4% rule ended up being fine in the great depression.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:59.360]   And it's not clear that that's, I mean, we don't have to have another great
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.840]   depression to have a set of circumstances where the 4% rule wouldn't work.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.440]   Right.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.120]   The permanent portfolio guys are screaming to say deflation, our plan works
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.520]   in deflation too.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:16.080]   I can hear them in my ear saying, get out of this stock bond paradigm and come over
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.960]   to the permanent portfolio side where we bring in some of the other, hopefully
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.360]   non-correlating assets.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.080]   I have one other thought.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.400]   I'm interested in your feedback.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.280]   And I've got three more questions and then we'll wrap up.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:35.000]   But I feel another major change that, and one thing that I'm particularly
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.840]   attracted to is bringing back the influence of dividends on an investor's
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:46.000]   portfolio, because in many ways, the easy answer to this retirement
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.320]   distribution rate, the safe withdrawal rate is don't burn your principal and
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.120]   set up a system where your principal is not being invaded.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.400]   So if you had a portfolio of dividend producing stocks and you were just
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.800]   spending the dividends, then no matter what's happening to the underlying
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.000]   values, you can live off of that stream of dividends.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.400]   You're not going to exhaust your portfolio.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:09.960]   This is an advantage that rental real estate has, that if you have rental real
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.080]   estate, you can just spend your net rental income without worrying necessarily
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.960]   about the underlying value of the portfolio.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:21.240]   And one of the concerns, however, is as our society has shifted away from
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:27.200]   dividends and with this emphasis, and for example, the most popular investment
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.640]   strategy now is the total return strategy and using indexing.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:36.000]   I'm just, I feel like that to me feels safer than counting everything on these
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.960]   safe withdrawal rates.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   And I wish for a re-emphasis on dividends, on not invading principal, rather living
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.880]   off of the production of that principal.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.640]   But it's hard to make that go with a client.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.120]   It's hard to make that go with a client who doesn't have enough to live off of
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.280]   dividends only to support their level of lifestyle.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.720]   Do you have any thoughts or feedback or is there anyone kind of bringing back a
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.600]   focus on dividends into the portfolio research?
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.520]   Yeah, I think that's a viable strategy.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.640]   I don't really have a strong opinion about it.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:12.120]   It's certainly like internet discussion boards and things.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.040]   A lot of people will talk about how they've basically built a portfolio of
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.360]   dividends stocks that are going to cover their retirements.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.600]   And I think, yeah, we'll help with the sequence of returns risk if you can
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:29.640]   avoid selling principal when the market is down, that if you're able to just
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:34.040]   live on those dividends and historically dividends do tend to keep up so that
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.760]   even if the stock price goes down, the dividend check might go down a little
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.960]   bit, but not by as much as the stock price.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.800]   I know William Bernstein, who's a writer and planner in Oregon has said, you
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:53.080]   could basically treat 50% of your dividend level as safe, historically
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.000]   dividends have never fallen by more than that.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.640]   The only other point about this is Vanguard did a study where they talked
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:05.560]   about how portfolios focused on higher dividends tend to have lower total
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:11.240]   returns than just the total market portfolio.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:17.120]   And in that regard, maybe an inferior strategy, but at the same time, though,
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:23.160]   if this is something that the client understands and can stick with and that
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.680]   Vanguard study didn't incorporate the sequence risk, if this really does help
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.760]   to avoid some of that sequence risk.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.360]   Yeah, I think it could be a viable strategy.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.480]   It needs to be studied more, but it's also difficult because it's just getting
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.000]   the historical data on different individual stocks and their dividends and
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.480]   so forth.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:47.560]   It's a little bit hard to define how you would study this in a systematic way.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.920]   But at some point, yeah, someone might look in that direction.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.360]   Especially in the light of the changing investment climate, because dividends
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:59:00.040]   are so heavily penalized today that you see many companies just for the sake of
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.680]   their shareholders.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:06.160]   And I'm uber simplifying the discussion, but simply saying, why would we pay
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:06.840]   dividends?
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.480]   We have the worst taxation policy ever on dividends.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.320]   It's better in our clients, in our customers, best in our owners, best
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.680]   interests for us to enhance their capital gains.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.120]   It's better for us to do stock buybacks.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.920]   It's better for us to do other alternative methods to return that money to our
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.640]   shareholders than paying dividends.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   And so I've read research that would just show there has been a change in the
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.560]   investment climate.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.440]   And so you would have to factor that into the research as well, which would make
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.920]   it tough.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:41.680]   I just think it's more intuitive in many ways.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:49.840]   And one of the challenges, and I'll wrap up the research portion and get into
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.400]   just a couple of your thoughts on solutions.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:55.280]   But one of the challenges when we talk about retirement planning, that's such a
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.480]   generalized term.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.160]   In my mind, I think about in many ways, almost three different levels of
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.000]   retirement planning.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.760]   If I'm doing planning for somebody who doesn't have many assets and is still
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.440]   interested in retirement planning, then their retirement planning, let's say
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.840]   lower income, lower assets, their retirement planning is going to look very
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.520]   different than a moderate middle income, middle assets, middle class person versus
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.440]   an affluent person.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:25.240]   Is that someone who is poor and is planning for retirement, 4% is not going
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.760]   to be a strategy that's going to be central.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.920]   And for someone who's affluent, 4% is not going to be a strategy that's central
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.200]   because there they may be able to deal with the variability of returns.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.440]   They may deal with the sequence of returns.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:47.280]   But where this 4% rule is most important would be for those, there's some term for
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.520]   it, I can't remember the right financial planning term, but...
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.680]   Mass affluent?
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.520]   Right, right.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.840]   The mass affluent who they've got just enough money, but not necessarily a lot
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.800]   of excess.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.400]   And then we're trying to figure out how can we maximize the spending of that
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.720]   income over their lifetime with the confidence and surety of knowing it's
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.760]   going to last for their entire lifetime.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.800]   But we don't want to die with a bunch of money.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   We don't want to underspend.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.320]   And so that's where some of this research is the most useful is in that middle
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.880]   tier where we're trying to maximize the return but not die with a bunch of extra
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.160]   money.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.240]   So it's...
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:26.840]   That's a fair...
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.840]   Sorry, I didn't ask, I didn't leave you with a question.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.520]   But that's where we've got to focus on.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.240]   We've got to focus in a little bit more.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:38.320]   And that's the job I think we as planners do is to interpret the research from the
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.480]   academic side, but then put it into context for an individual.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.400]   And I think we can do a huge amount of good in that area.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.000]   Any feedback on that comment?
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.120]   No, that's a fair point.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.880]   And even...
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.760]   So even though there's a difference between what is the safe withdrawal rate and
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.480]   then what is more like an optimal withdrawal rate that balances those
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.760]   considerations for wanting to be able to spend more when you're still alive and
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.400]   healthy and know you're alive versus wanting to protect.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.800]   There's not a high chance you're going to still be alive at age 100, but you don't
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.160]   want to be alive and destitute at age 100.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.200]   And looking at how to balance all that out, that moves you away from necessarily
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.720]   using the safe withdrawal rate to using something that might kind of balance
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.840]   those trade-offs better.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.600]   And that's, yeah, we need more research in that area.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.840]   That's the way the academics approach that is to use something called utility
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.720]   maximization of plugging in a formula of how much life satisfaction people get
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.880]   from different spending levels.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.360]   And then that satisfaction decreases with higher spending and then try and translate
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.040]   that all into what's a good spending strategy.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.720]   I'll have to research that more.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.880]   I haven't spent a lot of time reading any of that literature, so I'm interested in,
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.520]   I wrote that down.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.360]   I'm interested in reading some of the, some of the research in that area.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.480]   We just celebrated my grandmother's 100th birthday last week.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.920]   So thanks.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.720]   It does happen.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.400]   And you're right.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:14.280]   Was she on the Today Show with the Leatherman?
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.960]   No, no, she wasn't.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.800]   But she's doing well.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.360]   She lives in Wyoming and she is doing well.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.920]   All the family got together and celebrated her.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.200]   And it just shows that, you know, who knows, she could live another week or she
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.400]   could live another 10 years.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.680]   And you've got to account for that in your planning.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.240]   It makes a difference.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.800]   I'd like to ask you just a couple of questions.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   And as we wrap up about where to help our listeners continue their own research.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.080]   First, there's a lot of debate about the stock bond allocation.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.760]   Do you have some guidance that you could give people as far as how to think through
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.400]   their own allocation in their portfolio of stocks versus bonds, maximizing the total
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.440]   returns of exposure to stocks versus maximizing the volatility from greater
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.520]   exposure to bonds?
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.680]   Do you have any guidance that you could give people as far as how to think through
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.680]   that question for themselves, especially in light of safe withdrawal rates?
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:22.000]   Yeah, so the safe withdrawal rates, the 4% real style thinking is 50 to 75% stocks
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.800]   in retirement.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.840]   So the idea, if you're focused on upside and just want to maximize wealth or
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.120]   maximize the legacy, the inheritance you leave behind, then just the highest stock
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.040]   allocation that you can feel comfortably go with is going to, on average, give you
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.880]   the most wealth at the end.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.000]   On the downside of trying to protect your spending, and that's where the 4% rule is
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.360]   focused on trying to protect your spending.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.200]   Then actually even going back to some of Bengen's original work, the asset
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.400]   allocation doesn't matter that much anywhere between about 30 and 80% stocks
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.480]   is going to give you about the same worst case scenario with sustainable withdrawal
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:01.760]   rate.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.880]   And then with the sequence risk as well.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.920]   So one of the areas where I did research with Michael Kitsey, we wrote about the
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.040]   rising equity glide path in retirement.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.560]   But the idea instead of sticking with, say, a 60, 40, 60% stocks over your whole
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.880]   retirement, you start at retirement with about 30% stocks and then slowly work your
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:29.160]   way up towards 60% stocks that that can potentially provide even further protection
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.360]   on the downside while also giving you a lower average stock allocation.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:40.080]   It is clear that most retirees are going to need some stocks because fixed income, if
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.800]   they want to spend more than what the yield curve of more than what's feasible with a
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.240]   fixed income portfolio, then they have to take some market risk.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:54.000]   They have to have some stocks in the portfolio to hope that are hopefully going
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.520]   to grow and help provide protection for inflation.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:02.920]   So definitely need some stocks, but you're getting to then the point of.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:08.640]   There are a wide variety of stock allocations that will get the job done, and
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.320]   it's not necessarily the asset allocation that's the most important variable.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.600]   It's more about the spending rate, the flexibility with the spending.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:24.920]   And then and then the asset allocation, your rising equity glide path article, I
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.880]   think, would be counterintuitive when we're accustomed to thinking about the
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.960]   approach taken by the target date retirement funds, which is to start off with
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.040]   heavy stocks and to continually continually diminish the exposure to stocks
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.200]   throughout our lifespan, throughout our lifespan.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.240]   I understand your argument to be that by starting at the beginning of retirement
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.320]   with, as you said, a 30 percent stock allocation, 70 percent fixed income, then
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.600]   that would allow for a more stable portfolio and lowers the sequence of
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.520]   returns risk.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.800]   And then as time goes forward, because we have to worry less about the sequence of
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.080]   returns risk, we can take more volatility as time goes forward because we have a
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.800]   shorter amount of time and it makes less of a difference in the portfolio.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.680]   And so therefore, that's why you can increase your exposure to equities to
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.520]   capture the maximum total lifetime return throughout your retirement, because
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.200]   you're not so worried about having those four awful years, right, you know, from
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.640]   65 to 69.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.000]   Is that an accurate understanding of your of your paper and of your research?
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.000]   And basically, if you're not in the worst case scenario, your wealth continues to
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.560]   grow. And so your withdrawal rate as a percent of what's left in the portfolio
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.720]   is actually decreasing.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.280]   And so your retirement become even more stable and then you're bringing back up
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.120]   the equity exposure.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.400]   And yeah, that's if you are in a worst case scenario, it's you get those poor
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.120]   market returns in early retirement.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.240]   You have a lower stock allocation at that time to protect you.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.160]   And then to the extent that poor market conditions don't last forever, you're
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.360]   going to be increasing your stock allocation at a time where you're going to
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.160]   hopefully be getting some some better market returns.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:07.680]   Right.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.560]   And that's right.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.080]   It's I'm glad you pointed out it's very counterintuitive, though, for people.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.920]   I think it's very counterintuitive for people who have just mainly been exposed
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.800]   to this idea that as you get older, constantly decrease your exposure to
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.400]   equities. If you were encouraging, if there was somebody with an above average
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.440]   interest in this stuff, whether it's because they're trying to figure out their
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.040]   own plan or whether it's because they're an advisor or a planner who's trying to
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   help clients, somebody with an above average interest, where would you
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.600]   encourage someone to go to start their research and to start their their
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.520]   learning path?
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.120]   How would you teach somebody to educate themselves on this area?
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:53.320]   That's a good question. I've I've got a blog that I write quite frequently about
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320]   even reviewing different studies from others.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   So that could be a good starting point.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.120]   And that's if you just Google my name, you'll come across the blog pretty
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.200]   easily. My last name is Piazan Paul, F as in Frank, A.U.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.440]   First name Wade, W.A.D.E.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.720]   And then the American College also has the New York Life Center for Retirement
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.240]   Income, even though it has the corporate sponsor there.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.280]   So New York Life is an insurance company, but it's got it's a great educational
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.720]   resource with interviews with a lot of different experts from all over different
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.520]   aspects. And so that you can watch through those videos.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.800]   It's a great education.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.160]   And that's even where basically some of these the arguments in favor of the
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.640]   probability based approach.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   A lot of that comes with interviews with Michael Kitsies and Jonathan Guyton
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.920]   available through the New York Life Center.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.720]   So even though they're basically against insurance solutions, just pro total
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.080]   returns investing, it's an unbiased source of information that you can hear all
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.480]   the different sides of the story with the video series there.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.280]   And yeah, I think those are my blog and then the New York Life Center video
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.200]   series would be two really good places to get started for financial advisors.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.920]   The American College also has the RICP designation.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.080]   It's a three course sequence, a retirement income certified professional that
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.480]   goes into great detail about how all the different retirement income tools work
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:28.000]   and how to build a retirement income portfolio and how to claim Social Security
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.160]   and and just a whole lot of information related to retirement income.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.080]   And I'll put in a plug also, those are both really good results.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.120]   I'd put a put in a plug for people to find for a for if you're an advisor or
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.440]   planner become really excellent in this stuff.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.360]   I think the RICP curriculum from the American College is probably a perfect
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   place to start. And also, I mean, I haven't done that course of study.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.000]   Myself, but from all of the exposure that I've had to the topics that are
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   covered, I may do it myself just to give myself an organized way to work through
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.520]   it. So if you're an advisor or planner, specialize in this.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.800]   And then if you are an individual consumer, I think this is really one of the
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.160]   most valuable places that an individual financial planner can have.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.360]   One of the biggest impacts that an individual financial planner can have on
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.040]   your situation, it's unusual.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.240]   A lot of times people think a financial advisor, financial planner is all about
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.920]   maximizing the rate of return on their on their portfolio.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.200]   That has very little impact on on any of these studies.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.800]   These studies are all using index data, right?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.240]   Dr. Pfau, is that right? Yeah, right.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.720]   Right. It's all index data.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.160]   So all of these are based upon index data.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.440]   All of these are based upon just, you know, it's this is investing style
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.040]   diagnostic. But there are so many little things that a good planner can do, little
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.920]   things that can help, whether it's a Social Security distribution strategy,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:04.480]   maximizing that, just a huge amount of of research that that somebody can do.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.080]   There's a huge amount of good that a planner can do in this area that can help.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.360]   And I really believe, even though we've kind of glossed over it, I believe that
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.760]   some of these other strategies that that have been developed, whether it's a, you
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.160]   know, the systematic withdrawal strategy, focusing on the the the total return from
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.760]   a portfolio, a bucket strategy where you're, you know, you're you're setting
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.960]   aside different buckets of of investments towards different points of retirement, a
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.320]   flooring approach where you're trying to put a floor in place, an asset dedication
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.280]   approach where you're trying to match invest and invest certain investments to
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.920]   liabilities that are going to be incurred during retirement.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.080]   These strategies have been developed to try to help people to feel more
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.200]   comfortable with their portfolio.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.160]   And going back to my bias towards behavioral investing, the key to any plan
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.000]   is having you as an individual feel comfortable with the plan.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.320]   And if you feel comfortable with the plan, you'll follow it through.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.920]   So one person may be very comfortable with a 4% rule and just a series of
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.080]   systematic withdrawals.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.600]   Another person may not be comfortable with that and they'll bail on the plan, in
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.160]   which case all the academic research in the world doesn't help a bit.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.200]   When the market is, you know, when the market is taken to 25% decline and
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.280]   you're sitting there saying, how am I going to eat next year?
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.640]   You might need a different plan if that's your personal, if that's your personal
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.040]   approach.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.360]   So my plea would be advisors, sharpen up and potential clients consider
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.800]   consulting an advisor in this area.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.160]   It's a real, real value add in my opinion.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.840]   Dr. Fowler, I think that is most of what I had on my list.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.800]   Can you think of anything that I missed that you think would be valuable for
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.240]   people to be aware of?
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:51.680]   No, I think we had a pretty good introduction, but yeah, we, there are
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.200]   different retirement income strategies.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.920]   We didn't really talk much about that.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.880]   The buckets are time segmentation or asset dedication that you just mentioned.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.200]   But yeah, that's basically, you've got the systematic withdrawals, things like
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.520]   the 4% rule, then you've got holding individual bonds to meet upcoming
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.360]   expenses in the near term, and then having stocks or other growth investments
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.760]   for the longterm and then essentials versus discretionary, which is the floor
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.240]   upside.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.440]   It's building a safe and secure income floor for the basics and then having more
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.800]   volatile assets for discretionary expenses.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.480]   And yeah, it's, it's complicated.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.400]   It's William Sharpe who won a Nobel prize in economics.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.040]   He developed a lot of the tools of modern finance.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.600]   He said that he's now devoting the rest of his career to retirement
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.080]   income planning research.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:42.520]   Wow.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.520]   And he says it's the most difficult problem he's ever looked at.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.240]   So it's, it's tough.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   So there is value in advisors, getting more education and then individuals
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:57.480]   running things by an advisor to make sure that they're not making mistakes.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.120]   Even with social security, it's the difference between a good claiming
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.160]   strategy and a kind of default.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.720]   A lot of people just want to take it to age 62.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.160]   Well, if they end up living into their eighties or nineties, they could get a
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.000]   hundred, more than a hundred thousand dollars more if they make an optimal
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:15.960]   claiming strategy.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.160]   So it's an area where mistakes can be made and it's important to make sure
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.040]   you're doing things right.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.080]   And spend more time thinking about your retirement strategy than you do where
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.240]   you're going to buy the next vacuum cleaner to save $10 on the price.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.800]   It's, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars with retirement
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.440]   income planning.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.320]   It's huge.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:34.800]   It's huge.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.480]   It's hard for me to understand.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.760]   I understand that.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   And I'm very frustrated with my own industry as far as some of the awful
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.120]   work.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.080]   We deserve a lot of the criticism that we've taken.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:51.040]   It's very difficult for me to see, however, how an average person will be able
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.840]   to retire successfully without the input of a good financial advisor around these
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.520]   strategies.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.160]   And just from having worked with average people, it's very difficult for me to see
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.040]   how you can't do it with an advisor.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.600]   And I'll give you one anecdote, Dr.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.040]   Fowle, when I was up, when I was up your way last week in Bryn Mawr there for our
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.680]   MSFS capstone class, here is a room of some of the most qualified financial
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.440]   advisors I've ever sat in a room with.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.400]   And we were going over retirement distribution strategies.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:23.520]   And one of the individuals in our class had made an in, what's the word that
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:23.960]   means?
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.040]   Not, not ideal.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.240]   Like it wasn't the most ideal decision for social security.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.760]   And he had been pressured by the social security administration.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.600]   And I use the word pressured intentionally because that was what he
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.280]   experienced.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.480]   He'd been pressured into taking an, a suboptimal distribution strategy.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.800]   And thankfully, I think we were able to help him give him some strategies for
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.040]   unwinding that strategy and deferring it a little bit more.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:53.080]   But even amid, amidst a bunch of experts, many of us have made mistakes, me
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.600]   included.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.480]   So I think I'm glad to hear that about William Sharpe.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.240]   I have to, I have to reach out to him and maybe talk with him about some of what
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.040]   he's been studying.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.200]   And thank you for the work that you're doing.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.120]   I really appreciate it.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.080]   Okay, thank you.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.320]   Do you feel more well educated now?
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.600]   I hope you do.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.640]   That was the purpose of the show.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.600]   So hopefully that starts to give you some background for the 4% rule.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.000]   I would encourage you to go over to Dr.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.600]   Fowle's blog.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.720]   If you're interested in the technical side and the technical aspects of some of
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.000]   the academic literature that has been done in this area, start with his blog.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.160]   He does a good job of linking to some of the different resources and of discussing
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.960]   some of the different resources that are available.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.760]   Certainly not an easy area of science to read through, but it's an important
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.080]   science area of science.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.360]   I'm going to try as time goes on to bring you, maybe talk through some of the
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.480]   articles, talk through some of the different strategies that we talked about.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.720]   May bring Dr.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.880]   Fowle back in the future to discuss some of the strategies.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.200]   Probably the key thing that I would explain to you, however, is I think there's a big
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.520]   difference between being able to talk about this information in a technical way
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.240]   that's straightforward and being able to apply it to an individual situation.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.360]   In my experience working with clients, that's where the real rubber meets the
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:08.600]   road.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:15.080]   That's where a good financial planner can really have a fighting chance, I think,
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.600]   to really impact a client's, it really impacts your situation.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.840]   So I would encourage you to consider this, but don't go too deeply into the
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.400]   technical side because the technical aspects are just really one side of the
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:28.960]   situation.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.320]   But hopefully you feel more well educated now and able to understand the
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.440]   information that comes at you.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.040]   That's it for today's show.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.560]   Hope you've enjoyed it.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.480]   Back in the saddle now, doing these shows full time.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.680]   Got some more interviews coming this week and answer some listener questions.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.320]   Really working on improving some stuff on the show.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.360]   I've got a lot of things on my to-do list.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.520]   To improve, I thank you for being here and would love your feedback on today's
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:54.760]   show.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.520]   It's challenging to do these technical shows, but I think I'm going to try to do
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.320]   more of them, especially in an interview format.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.840]   I'm going to try to do more on my own as well.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.880]   So we'll just see how it goes.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.240]   Learning with you.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.560]   Thank you for listening.
