[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.900]   All right, our next speaker is gonna be Christine Benz.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.780]   She is a member of the Boglehead's board of directors.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.740]   She is the director of personal finance,
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.260]   a columnist and podcaster for a renowned
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.860]   and highly respected website that I will not mention here.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.740]   She was previously the director
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.420]   of mutual fund analysis there though,
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.820]   supervising 35 mutual fund analysts.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.900]   She is the author of two investing books.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.980]   She is an avid cook.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.220]   She's a political junkie
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.780]   and a long-suffering Chicago Cubs fan.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260]   She is also the only keynote speaker
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.620]   I've ever had at my conference that did not take the money.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.300]   It was all donated 100% to charity.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.280]   Christine Benz.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.100]   This is so great to see all of you here.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.700]   I am so excited to have the Boglehead's conference
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.340]   in my hometown of Chicago.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.740]   As we were planning it, I was like,
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.660]   well, something central, gee, where could that be?
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.920]   So it's really great to see you all here.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.420]   I've just been excited about this conference
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420]   for several years now as we've had a few false starts
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.540]   with COVID and it's just exciting
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.120]   to see it come to fruition.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.300]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a Chicago joke,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.060]   which is that you may know one of the things
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.100]   that you hear in Chicago is to vote early and often.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.540]   It's an old sort of admonition
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.900]   and it's been variously attributed to Al Capone
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.220]   or I think one of the former mayors, Richard Daley.
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.200]   We don't know who said it,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.620]   but we're not known for great governance here in Chicago
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.740]   and we're not known for great governance in Illinois.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.060]   But that segues nicely into the topic that I was given,
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.220]   which is invest early and often.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.860]   And that's a better practice.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.300]   That's good governance for your financial plan.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.940]   So I'll talk a little bit about both aspects of this,
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.820]   getting started early, as well as the often part.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.740]   The getting started early part is pretty uncontroversial.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620]   I'm sure we've all seen the slides
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.580]   that show the value of even a small sum,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.460]   getting started early.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.180]   The second part is interestingly
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.340]   a little bit more controversial.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.620]   This idea of dollar cost averaging,
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.500]   investing at regular intervals versus a lump sum.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.180]   And so we'll examine that issue.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.260]   I come down on the side of dollar cost averaging
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.100]   simply because that's how most of us
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.780]   have our money to invest, right?
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.300]   We have our salaries, we take a piece of them
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.960]   and we invest them.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   It's a little difficult to persuade your employer
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.660]   to prepay you your salary for the next 10 years.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.260]   You simply have your funds to invest
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.780]   at regular intervals over your investing career.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.340]   So Jack Bogle said this well,
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.540]   this idea of investing early and often.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.100]   He said, "Investing is a virtuous habit
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.620]   "best started as soon as possible."
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.500]   Very succinct, very Jack Bogle.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900]   He was always so eloquent in talking about
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.340]   what we should do in our financial lives
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.180]   and with our portfolios.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.840]   So successful investors heed Jack Bogle's great advice
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.300]   in a couple of ways.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.620]   One is to start investing early,
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.880]   even if it means starting small.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.780]   That's why I always evangelize about people with children
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.060]   who have some sort of earnings,
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.700]   even if it's mowing lawns or being a lifeguard
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.780]   or whatever it is,
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.060]   as long as they have any earnings whatsoever,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.540]   they can make a contribution
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.600]   to some type of a financial account in their own name,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.060]   like a Roth IRA, for example.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.620]   And the great benefit of that
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.900]   is that it doesn't have to be the actual funds
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.240]   that they earned.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.580]   You can actually match them on the funds
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580]   that they've earned.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.560]   But just get those funds working
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.900]   and when they eventually need the money in retirement
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.620]   or whatever the case may be,
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460]   they'll have a lot more working for them.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.180]   And then investing regularly and systematically
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.220]   is another way that Bogleheads can take the advice
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.140]   to invest early and often to heart.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.300]   So one of the key reasons to get started early
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.220]   is that when you break it down,
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.940]   your investment return,
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.620]   the amount that you have at the end of your time horizon,
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.860]   depends on three key factors.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.240]   So how much you put in,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.840]   that's the major determinant
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.260]   of how much you have at the end, obviously,
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.920]   how long you invest,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.100]   and the rate of return that you're able to earn.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.960]   This is all pretty obvious.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.500]   The thing that we might think a little less about
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.660]   is that that third item
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.720]   is something that's almost completely outside of our control.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.900]   Certainly we have some discretion over what we invest in,
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.560]   but we just don't know how the market will behave
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.780]   over our time horizon.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.760]   That's why it's so important to focus
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.980]   on the first couple of things,
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.980]   how much you put in and how long you invest.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.340]   So this is just a simple illustration
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.220]   of the power of getting started early.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.980]   So let's assume that we have Sammy
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.220]   who is just getting started in her career,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.900]   she's 24 years old,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.220]   and she finds $200 a month in her budget
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.080]   to invest in Vanguard's total stock market.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.620]   So she makes a good investment selection
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.180]   and she just sticks with that program.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.560]   Now, ideally, she would bump up her contributions
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.020]   as her salary increases,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.820]   but we'll just hold it static
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.620]   for the purpose of this example.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.340]   And she also earns a really nice return
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.380]   over her 40-year time horizon.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.780]   So we're assuming that she wants to retire in her mid-60s.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.300]   So she earns an 8% return.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.220]   Whether that will prevail over the next 40 years
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.580]   I think is an open question.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.820]   It's arguably a little bit aggressive,
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.380]   but we're assuming that she earns that 8% return.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.380]   If we have another example
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.740]   of someone who waits even 10 years, Jeremy,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.060]   he maybe has taken a little longer
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.820]   to get his career off the ground.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.480]   Maybe he's gone to graduate school,
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.460]   maybe he's just taken a while to launch his career.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.620]   He doesn't start investing until he's 34,
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.460]   but he is able to find more in his budget to invest.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.460]   So he's able to find $400 in contrast with Sammy's $200.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.620]   But he has a shorter time horizon
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.740]   because he got started later.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.140]   So assuming he wants to retire in his mid-60s also,
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.980]   like Sammy, it's interesting when you examine the data,
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.500]   what you can see is that even though
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.380]   Sammy's total contribution was substantially less
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.020]   over her 40-year time horizon,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.780]   the fact that she started 10 years before Jeremy,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.300]   even though they had the same return,
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.300]   she came up with substantially more
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.500]   at her retirement date than did Jeremy
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.820]   simply because of that foregone five years.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.100]   We all know this, we all practice this ideally in our lives.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.220]   It's just something if you have young people in their lives
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.620]   who are getting started in their careers,
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.740]   it's so important to talk to them
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.700]   about the value of trying to peel something
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.500]   out of their budgets if they possibly can.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.300]   So that's the first part of the piece.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.020]   First part of the adage or first part of the advice,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.740]   getting started early is important.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.300]   I think we can all agree on that.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.340]   The data are unequivocal about the value of doing that.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.940]   What about the value of this idea of investing often?
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.380]   If investing early is so valuable,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.780]   shouldn't you just be trying to get your funds
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.140]   into the market as soon as possible?
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.380]   The answer to that is a little more nuanced
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.060]   and I think it's helpful to examine the data.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.060]   So this is some research that my colleagues
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.700]   at Morningstar did and I'll just explain it
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.420]   because it may be a little bit hard
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.500]   to read in the back of the room.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.660]   But this is examining lump sum investments
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   versus dollar cost averaging investments
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.620]   and what you can see is that the lump sum investment
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.140]   except over very short time horizons
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   consistently beats the dollar cost averaging investment.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.580]   So the basic takeaway here is that if you find yourself
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.700]   with a lump sum for whatever reason,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.220]   and I know this sometimes comes up in my own household
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.460]   where you have a bonus, for example,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.380]   it's easy to equivocate about is this the right time
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.060]   to put the money in the market?
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.740]   And the answer is, generally speaking,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.580]   if you have a reasonably long time horizon for those funds,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.780]   you're probably better just getting that money to work
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.460]   as soon as possible.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.220]   So if you have a lump sum, put it to work
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.180]   unless you have a very short time horizon.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.380]   But there are a few problems with that conclusion.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.140]   The first one, and I kept saying this to my colleagues
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.700]   as they were working on this research,
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.540]   is most of us don't have a lump sum to invest.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.820]   It's just not how we save.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.740]   We have fixed amounts that we might be able to find
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.940]   in our budgets, that's what we can put into the market.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.740]   So yes, if you find yourself with a lump sum
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.260]   and you have a long time horizon,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.620]   by all means get it in there,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.700]   but most of us don't have our money to save in that way.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.980]   Instead, we just have that portion of our paychecks.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.660]   And then another benefit of dollar cost averaging,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.660]   of dribbling your money into the market
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.380]   over a period of time,
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.620]   is that it limits the odds that you'll put the money to work
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.700]   at precisely the wrong time.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.780]   By spacing out your contributions,
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.820]   it reduces the regrets that you might have
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.380]   of getting the money to work
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.900]   and having it be a terrible time.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.300]   So that's another key value to dollar cost averaging.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.180]   But the big one is simply that most of us
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.260]   have our funds to invest at regular intervals
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.860]   rather than all at one time.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.980]   This is another slide that I think demonstrates
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.900]   how dollar cost averaging can smooth out the bumps
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.380]   of a rough market.
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.660]   So this examines the 2000s,
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.900]   which many of you were investing through,
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.420]   I was investing through.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.900]   You remember it was just a bad decade for investors, right?
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.780]   So we had that dot-com sell-off
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.340]   in the early part of the decade,
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.100]   then we had the financial crisis
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.500]   in the second half of the decade.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.020]   Not a great environment.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.180]   And so when we look at the person who put a lump sum in
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.980]   at what would have been a lousy time to do so
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.620]   in early 2000,
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.180]   you can see that the lump sum investor
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.660]   over that very bad decade
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.380]   actually underperformed the dollar cost averager.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.300]   There will be periods in time
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.860]   where the dollar cost averager,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.260]   because he or she is getting the money to work
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.380]   when the market's depressed, when it's fallen further,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.820]   that person will come out ahead.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.740]   But asset class diversification helps address that.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.180]   So the blue bars in this slide
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.300]   show that the dollar cost averager
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.660]   in a 60/40 stock bond portfolio
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.140]   actually outperformed the lump sum investor
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.840]   simply because having that balanced
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.020]   asset class diversification
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.020]   helped take the edge off of the lump sum portfolio.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.340]   Investment.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.340]   So I think perhaps the most important thing
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.980]   about dollar cost averaging
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.980]   and why I would say that investing often makes so much sense
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.420]   is that it just instills discipline.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.900]   In your budgeting, in your financial plan,
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.220]   this idea of putting all of your contributions
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.060]   on autopilot helps ensure that you stick with the plan.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.740]   In fact, we've had kind of a lively debate
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.780]   among our Morningstar staff about budgeting.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.800]   And I've always said,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.460]   I really have never had a budget in my household.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.180]   The main thing we've done
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.460]   is that we have automated our savings.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.460]   We've set up our savings
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.920]   and then we have just let the chips fall
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.700]   in terms of how we manage the money that we have left over.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.320]   I think that's a fantastic practice.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.940]   It's something that takes a certain amount of discipline,
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.300]   but the great thing is that
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.100]   all of these financial services providers
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.740]   are very willing to let you
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.780]   put your contributions on autopilot.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.380]   And you can do it with everything.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.720]   I think most people kind of stop with their 401ks.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.980]   You can do it with your IRA contributions,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.180]   most HSA, health savings account contributions
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.220]   are coming out of your paycheck on autopilot.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.220]   We do it with our taxable accounts as well.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.820]   So having that discipline helps ensure
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.220]   that you stay invested.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.760]   It helps ensure that you make those contributions
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.200]   and you stick with your plan.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   So this slide shows the merits of staying invested
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.260]   because it helps ensure that you are on board
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.860]   for the market's best days.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.220]   And one thing we know and is worth saying
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.260]   in this sort of environment
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.380]   where we've seen almost everything go down
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.460]   is that if you can just stick with that plan,
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.340]   oftentimes when the market turns,
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.140]   it turns very quickly when things get better.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.860]   And it's very hard to predict when that will be.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.340]   So having that regular dollar cost averaging plan
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.540]   just helps keep you in your seat and stick with your plan.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.100]   So getting started,
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.860]   even with a small amount is the way to go.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.380]   Lump sum investing, if you have a lump sum,
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.700]   get it put into the market as soon as possible,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   unless you have a short time horizon for those funds,
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.280]   in which case you may want to dollar cost average.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.580]   And then of course, you'd also want to be thoughtful
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.500]   about what asset allocation you use.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.900]   And finally, investing fixed sums at regular intervals
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.140]   is just a great way to run your household savings plan
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.740]   and ensure that you stick through
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.020]   these tricky market environments.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.060]   So I'll just leave it there.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.900]   I know we have to keep things moving along.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.900]   So I'll see you later to talk diversification.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.420]   (audience applauding)
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.220]   Thank you, Christine.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.220]   Isn't she great?
