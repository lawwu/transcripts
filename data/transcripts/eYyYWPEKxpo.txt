[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   One year ago today, health officials in the United States confirmed COVID case number
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   1000. A year ago today. What a year since. In uncertain times like the ones that we live
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.960]   in today, it's especially relevant to ponder God's providence, the theme of Pastor John's
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.440]   new book by that title. The reassuring truth of scripture is that God's sovereign decree
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.000]   governs over everything, over every virus and over every nation and over every human
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.160]   ruler. He does this to bring about his final purpose and end for his creation. It's such
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.360]   an awesome doctrine. When we can see it and delight in it, it can make a very deep and
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.800]   definite impact in how we live our lives, even down to how we fulfill our mission on
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.000]   earth. It's one of 10 implications Pastor John is focusing on in this little Wednesday
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.800]   series on the podcast. Last time in episode 1595, we looked at how God's providence gives
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   us the confidence that God has the right and the power to answer our prayers. Providence
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.360]   gives us the confidence to pray. That was implication number eight. Here now with implication
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   number nine is Pastor John. This ninth real life effect, real life benefit of believing
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.120]   firmly in the all embracing providence of God is very closely related to the previous
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:43.640]   benefit concerning prayer. There, back in that previous podcast, we turned the objection
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.000]   that prayer is pointless if providence is true upside down and said, "No, no, no.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   In fact, the truth of providence makes prayer powerful, not problematic." Now I'm going
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.280]   to do the very same thing with evangelism and world missions that I did with prayer.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.980]   So here is the ninth glorious life-changing benefit of believing in the all embracing
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.200]   providence of God. It shows us that evangelism and world missions, finishing the Great Commission
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.000]   against all human odds, these human activities are absolutely essential for people to be
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.320]   converted to Christ and for the nations to be reached and will be successful. These essential
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.520]   human activities of evangelism and world missions will be successful precisely because of God's
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.480]   all embracing providence that has the right and the power to convert sinners to himself.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   That's the ninth glorious life-changing benefit, being confident of that double reality. In
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:19.040]   other words, the reality of God's providence guarantees the sending and going of missionaries
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   and evangelists and witnesses to the neighborhoods and nations of the world. And it guarantees
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   that through these human means, conversions to Christ will happen, and the church of Christ
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.960]   will be built in all the places and among all the peoples that God intends for it to
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.200]   be. The objection to evangelism and world missions
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   that I am turning upside down into a blessing, a blessing of providence, rather than a problem
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.600]   for providence, is this. They say, the objectors say, when they consider this view of providence
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   that I'm asking you to take so seriously, they say, "Well, there's no point in evangelism
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.000]   and missions since God has planned already, even from eternity, who will be saved."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.640]   Now, again, just like with prayer that we saw last time, again, a glance at the Bible
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:31.920]   will reveal that God's plan to save people is through the Word. Romans 10, 17, "Faith
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.520]   comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word." And his plan is that this saving Word be preached
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.960]   by human beings. The Bible is plain. No one believes and is saved without hearing the
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:59.920]   gospel. The new birth comes through the living and abiding Word, the gospel. 1 Peter 1.23
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.000]   goes like this, "You have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   through the living and abiding Word of God, and this Word is the good news that was preached
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   to you." The gospel is not written in the clouds. It is entrusted to Christians who
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.800]   become witnesses and missionaries. If there were no human witnesses, there would be no
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.640]   salvation. Listen to Romans 10, 13-17, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.320]   saved, but how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.880]   they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.680]   preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? So faith comes from hearing,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.520]   and hearing through the Word of Christ." When Jesus commissioned Paul to the Gentiles,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:14.080]   he said to do what only God can do. Listen to these words. These are the words of Jesus
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.520]   to Paul, "I am sending you to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.840]   to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.480]   and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me." That's Acts 26, 17, and
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.040]   18. Open blind eyes? Really? Liberate from Satan? Really? I mean, he's just a mere
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.320]   human being, right? That was Paul's mission, and it is ours. Jesus gives it to us, namely,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:57.760]   to become the human means of what only God can do. Open the eyes of the blind, spiritually
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:07.400]   dead, raise them up to life. How do the blind see? How are the enslaved set free? Answer,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.320]   by evangelism, by missions, by words, speaking the words. Faith comes by hearing, hearing
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:23.120]   by human words, speaking the Word of God. We are the instruments. We become in the hands
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:32.360]   of providence the means of the miracle of the conversion of sinners to Christ everywhere.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.960]   But evangelism and world missions are even more amazing in the hands of providence. The
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:48.760]   obedient senders and goers in missions are not just the means of the miracle of conversion.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:56.560]   They are themselves a miracle, the miracle of obedience. God's providence is miraculously
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:06.920]   at work in us for obedience before he uses us for the work of the conversion of others.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:15.540]   We are a miracle before we work miracles in the providence of God. From start to finish,
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:23.640]   evangelism and world missions is a gracious work of providence. When we go or send in
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.600]   obedience to Christ, God has triumphed over our selfishness and our provincial limitations
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:41.900]   of his good news. And then, when we speak thus obediently to unbelievers, the Lord works
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:55.720]   the second miracle. According to Acts 6.14, the Lord opened Lydia's heart to give heed
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:04.320]   to what was said by Paul. The providence-created obedience of Paul speaking to Lydia is followed
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.720]   by the providence-created belief in the heart of Lydia.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:19.280]   As in the case of prayer, the unthwartable providence of God is not a problem for evangelism
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:28.040]   and missions. It is their only hope of success. The obstacles to missions around the world
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:37.240]   today are insurmountable, but for one thing—that the providence of God is unstoppable. It cannot
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:44.320]   be stopped by closed countries. It cannot be stopped by hostile religions. It cannot
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:52.680]   be stopped by difficult languages and cultures. It cannot be stopped by the ultimate self-determination
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.000]   of the fallen human soul, not the self-determination of the Muslim soul or the self-determination
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.920]   of the Hindu soul or the self-determination of the Buddhist soul or the self-determination
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:12.060]   of the Jewish soul or the purely secular soul, because in the world of God's providence,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:22.360]   there is no such thing as the ultimate self-determination of the human will. It does not exist. Only
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:31.520]   God is ultimately, sovereignly self-determining. We may—indeed, we must—build our lives
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:39.400]   and our mission on this confidence. "I will build my church," says the Lord Jesus,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.880]   "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it," Matthew 16, 18. That is a statement
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.120]   of sovereign, purposeful providence. And to that end, Matthew 24, 14, "This gospel of
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.360]   the kingdom will be proclaimed." That's a statement of sovereign providence. It will
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.920]   be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.680]   end will come. One of my most urgent prayers for this book
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:17.240]   on providence is that God will use this book to catapult thousands of new missionaries
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.360]   into God's harvest with undaunted confidence in God's unstoppable providence.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.700]   Amen. May it be. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening. We are normally answering

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:53.840]   DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. Episode 1599 is up next. 1599. We're going to look at how
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.200]   we know who God is. It's a highly debated question. Who are we as Christians to say
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.260]   who God is? We're going to look at that and our basis of authority for speaking about
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.460]   God, and we're going to do that next time on Friday with Pastor John in the studio again
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.180]   with us. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
