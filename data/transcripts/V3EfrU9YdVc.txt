[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.600]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 8 and verse 28. The 28th verse in the 8th
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.240]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:32.400]   up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself;
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.080]   but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.820]   have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that I am He, and that I do nothing
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.560]   of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   Here we are still continuing our consideration of these extraordinary people, these Pharisees
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:13.080]   and other Jews who reacted in such an unforeseen and such a strange manner to our Lord and
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.260]   Saviour when he spoke the words recorded in the 12th verse of this chapter, because there
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.660]   you remember he stood up in the temple and said, "I am the light of the world; he that
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:36.860]   followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." I say again
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.300]   that nothing more glorious, more wonderful has ever been uttered to a gathering of men
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.740]   and women. What is needed by everybody in the world and has always been needed above
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.300]   everything else is light—the light of knowledge, the light of understanding, the light of truth,
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:05.260]   the light of holiness. The world is in darkness; the world is a dark place. And here he stands
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.020]   before them and offers them of everything that very light that they stand most in need
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.860]   of. And yet you remember we have been seeing that the reaction of these people to him was
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.700]   that they attacked him, questioned him, tried to trip him and to trap him. The Pharisees
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.780]   therefore said unto him, "Thou barest record of thyself; thy record is not true." And they
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.700]   continued thus to question and to cross-examine him and to oppose him in every conceivable
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.100]   way. And this strange and extraordinary phenomenon, I say, is the one that is still confronting
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.500]   us in the world. There is the supreme tragedy in the world tonight. It is the failure and
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.700]   the refusal of men to recognize and to believe in and to follow the Son of God, the Saviour
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.580]   of the world. What is the cause of this? That is what is engaging us, and we are engaged
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.820]   in it not because it is an interesting theme. It is, of course, from the mere standpoint
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.580]   of intellect and the employment of reason and of logic. There is nothing which is comparable
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.380]   to an analysis of a statement, a passage like this in the Scripture. But God knows we are
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.540]   not met together to do that. The world is in too desperate a condition for any of us
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.460]   to be theoretical. We cannot afford just to sit down and to look on and to be interested
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.420]   and have a debate and an argument and a discussion. That is like Nero fiddling while Rome is burning,
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.380]   and that is what so many are doing today. But we are not met together to do that. We
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.500]   are here considering this for this reason, that the consequences of this rejection of
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.340]   the Son of God are so terrible. Look at it as you see it in these people. Here is one
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.500]   who tells them, I say, not that he has come to blast them or to destroy them, but to save
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.620]   them, to give them light, to lead them out into truth, to victory and to joy, and yet
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.380]   they hate him and turn against him. What makes them do it? Well, we have been considering
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.980]   the causes. We see their whole spirit is run. We have seen that their whole mode of thinking
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   is run. Their thinking, he says, is in an earthly, in a carnal manner, earthly thoughts.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.260]   And we have seen that they were tragically ignorant of the truth about themselves and
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.780]   about their whole relationship to him. But then last Sunday night we took up another
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.580]   section, a different point. We saw that in many ways we can say that these people reacted
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.260]   like this and rejected the Son of God because they were ignorant of the consequences of
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.420]   doing that. And that shows itself here in two main respects. We dealt with one of them
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.540]   last Sunday night. It was this you remember. He said to them, if you go on refusing me
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.220]   and rejecting me like this, he says in verse 24, I said therefore unto you that ye shall
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:14.420]   die in your sins, for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. That is
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.300]   a terrible thing, as I think everybody who was here last Sunday night will agree. Nothing
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.900]   is more important about a man and his life in this world than the way in which he dies.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.900]   We've all got to remember there are only two ways of dying, we saw. You either die in your
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.540]   sins or else you die in the Lord. But mankind doesn't know anything about that. It's not
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.260]   interested. It regards that as being morbid. They shouldn't consider it, they say. They're
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.460]   not interested, but they will be. Because I say it's inevitable and unavoidable. And
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.860]   our Lord just tells them plainly, repeats it to you remember, twice over, so that he
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.100]   says it all together three times, that he says if you don't believe in me, you shall
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:11.780]   die in your sins. And there is nothing more terrible than that, than to die in our sins
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.060]   just as we are, and to go on for all eternity just like that. Terrible. Appalling. But that's
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.660]   not the only thing he says that they're not aware of in this realm of consequences and
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.460]   of results. They're equally ignorant of something else. Well, what is that? Well, he says it
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:41.060]   is this. They're equally ignorant concerning his death. Ignorant of their own death and
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.980]   their own way of dying. Ignorant of his death and his way of dying, and what his death means.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.760]   This is extraordinary. He says you are rejecting me, you don't know the consequences. The consequences
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.140]   will be terrible in the matter of your own death, and then there will be other consequences
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.020]   as the result of my death. Now that's the matter that he is dealing with in this 28th
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.660]   verse that we are looking at together this evening. Here you see he seems to be gathering
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.980]   it all up, and he puts it in this way. Now there are just two terms here that we must
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.340]   be clear about, because if we are not clear about them, we cannot possibly understand
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:27.820]   the message. He says, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man," what does that mean? Well,
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.740]   it's primarily, of course, a reference to his death. You remember that a way back in
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.300]   chapter 3 in verse 14 he said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.340]   must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.900]   everlasting life." Lifted up, crucified, raised on a tree and nailed to it. That's it. It's
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.840]   a reference to his death by crucifixion. You saw the same thing in the reading at the beginning
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.260]   in chapter 12 in verse 32. "And I," he said, "if I be lifted up will draw all men unto
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.300]   me." And then John goes on to explain that he was thus speaking of the manner of his
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:15.660]   death. Death by crucifixion. Raised up, nailed to a tree. His death and all that follows
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.460]   it. That's what he means by the term "lifting up."
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.580]   But then the other expression that we must glance at is this. He says, "When you have
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:35.220]   lifted up the Son of Man, then shall you know that I am he. And that I do nothing of myself,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.340]   but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things." Now, what does he mean by this? Well,
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.660]   on the surface it seems to say this, doesn't it? He's saying, "Well, you don't believe
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:52.780]   in me now, but after you've crucified me and killed me and after I've died, then you're
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.340]   all going to see the truth about me and you're all going to believe it." But of course it
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:02.940]   cannot mean that for a moment, because the history itself tells us that many of these
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.420]   Jews didn't believe in him after his death, nor even after his resurrection. They went
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.420]   on disbelieving and rejecting him and turning against him. So it cannot mean that he is
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.580]   saying here that all these people who now rejected him after his death would come to
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.580]   believe in him. It's impossible that it means that. Well then, what does it mean? Well,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.220]   I suggest that it means something like this, that we can look at this in three different
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:35.220]   ways. One thing he is very definitely saying, it seems to me, is that some of them really
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.020]   will come to believe in him in that way, because we are told that that did actually happen.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.820]   They didn't all of them, but some of them did. So it includes that meaning that some
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:52.180]   of them will come to believe after his death and resurrection, not now, but then. There
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.100]   are many instances of that. We get them in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. So that
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.540]   that's a part of the meaning. But I don't think it's the chief meaning here. I suggest
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.820]   to you that the chief meaning here is this, that he's saying in this striking manner,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.460]   you don't believe in me now, and I can't prove it to you. I'm standing before you, as it
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:22.660]   were, as but a man, and it's simply a question of my word. But you know, he says, when you
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.780]   have killed me, when I've been crucified, after you have done away with me, as it were,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:36.380]   in the way that you're going to do it, then the truth concerning me is going to be made
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:44.020]   clear, it's going to be manifested. I believe that's the main meaning. But there is a third
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:54.420]   meaning, and I'm equally certain of this. He is actually saying that a day will come
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:01.540]   when every single one of them would see and know the truth concerning him. Now mark what
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:08.660]   I say, and as I put it, "Then said Jesus unto them, After you have lifted up the Son
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.900]   of Man," the "when" can be translated like that, "after you have lifted up the
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.020]   Son of Man," he doesn't measure the distance of time in this word "after," but sometime
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:32.940]   after you put me to death by crucifixion, sometime after, "you shall know that I am
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:39.940]   indeed the one whom I claim to be, the one of whom I have been speaking. You shall know
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:48.180]   that I am he." Every one of you, all of you who have rejected me, you shall know it.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.660]   I think that is the third and the ultimate meaning. Very well, then, having defined our
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:59.500]   terms, let us come and look at the message. What is he saying here? Well, the first thing
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.380]   he says, and it's a very striking one, isn't it? He's telling them that they are going
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:10.500]   to kill him and to put him to death by crucifixion. I don't want to stay with this this evening,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.620]   but we can't slide over it because it's such an astounding statement. Here is this
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.980]   man, apparently just an ordinary man, and yet he stands there and he looks at these
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.060]   people who are thus arguing with him and debating with him, and he says, "I know all about
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.540]   you. I know what's in your heart." They may not have even thought of it fully at this
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.500]   time, but he knew it. He knew what was coming. He knew why he'd come into this world. And
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.740]   so he just tells them, he announces to them, that they themselves are going to kill him.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.260]   They're going to crucify him. That's the way in which they're going to put him to death.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.020]   It wasn't the Jewish way, that was stoning, but he knew that they were going to hand him
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:52.740]   over to the Romans and their method was crucifixion. It's a remarkable prophecy. Oh, I'm just emphasizing
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.780]   it in passing for this reason. If you're in trouble about believing in this person,
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.380]   my dear friend, read your Gospels again. Watch every statement. What you've got to explain,
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.340]   you see, is how this man, whom you think is just a man, how he knew all this, how he was
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.140]   able to prophesy all this so accurately, how he was able to tell them the way they were
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.320]   going to do it, that they themselves were not going to do it directly, but they'd hand
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.900]   him over and get the Romans in authority to do it for them, and thus he would be killed
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:27.540]   and die by crucifixion. And so, you see how the 22nd Psalm was fulfilled, which is an
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:34.900]   amazingly detailed description of a slow death by crucifixion. Thus, you see, even the prophet,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.460]   centuries before, in the Psalms, was able to see the mode of the death of the Son of
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:46.300]   God, and you get this extraordinary phenomenon of the fulfillment and verification of Scripture.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.540]   Note that in passing. But then note this other thing that he tells them. He says, "When you
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.980]   have lifted up the Son of Man." Why does he describe himself like that? What does he mean
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.380]   by that? It's a very significant statement. You see, our Lord, in everything he said to
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.500]   these people, was talking about himself and giving a revelation concerning himself. They
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.820]   don't follow him, doesn't matter. He's telling them. And if they'd but had the sense to be
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.740]   humble and childlike and say, "We don't understand. Will you help us? Will you give us further
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.740]   elucidation?" Oh, he would have been delighted to do so, but they never did, you see. Standing
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.140]   back in their supposed knowledge, they just question him and try to get him down, and
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.140]   so they remain in darkness. But he's telling them. He says, "When you have lifted up the
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:39.540]   Son of Man." What's he mean by this? Well, you had the answer in that portion we read
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.260]   out of the seventh chapter of the prophecy of Daniel at the beginning. It's all there
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.460]   in that thirteenth verse. He used the term deliberately. Do you remember what we had
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.140]   there? Well, there was a great description, you see, a prophecy of the future. Daniel
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.580]   is given this vision of the future, and what does he see? Well, he sees these beasts rising.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:05.460]   They represent the different nations, different powers, the Chaldeans, the Medo-Persians,
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.580]   the Greeks, and so on. They're represented by these animals. Then this terrible animal
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:16.220]   that came, the Roman Empire in power, and this great devastation, this animal that destroyed
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:26.340]   with his teeth, teeth of iron, the Roman Empire. And the whole picture is one of confusion.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.060]   But suddenly Daniel was given a vision of God in his everlasting glory, the Ancient
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   of Days, the Creator and the Owner of the universe. And suddenly there appears before
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:46.180]   him one like the Son of Man. And do you remember what we had told about him? Here is the deliverer.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.260]   Here is one who is going to establish a kingdom amongst all those other kingdoms which is
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:58.500]   going to last forever, a kingdom to which there will be no end. Here is one like the
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.620]   Son of Man, no longer like your beasts, altogether different, not an earthly power, not an earthly
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.880]   king, one like unto the Son of Man. He suddenly comes. Here is the victor. Here is the one
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.020]   who's going to solve the problem. And he's going to set up a kingdom that will be everlasting
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:18.100]   and indestructible, and he will reign over all forever and ever. Who is this Son of Man?
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:26.260]   Well, here is the Messiah, the promised Messiah. Now here he is telling them that. He says,
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.300]   "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you shall know that I am He." Who? Well, the
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.340]   Messiah. The two terms mean the same thing. He's identifying himself with the Son of Man
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:41.620]   in the vision of Daniel. He's saying, "I am the long-awaited deliverer. I am your Messiah.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.060]   I am the one that the prophets have looked forward to. You don't know it, but you're
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.780]   going to crucify your own Messiah. That's the final crime, the final folly." He's telling
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:17:03.860]   them this. "When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that I am He."
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:09.700]   Well, this is a tremendous statement. What is he saying? Well, he is the Son of Man.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.780]   Not a Son of Man. He appeared to be a Son of Man. He just looked like a man like every
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.700]   other man. He doesn't say, "I am a Son of Man." He says, "I am the Son of Man."
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.700]   What's it mean? Well, it tells us the character of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is a man. Jesus
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:34.500]   of Nazareth, born of the Virgin, certainly a man. Ah, yes, but not just a man. The Son of Man.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:46.740]   Man, but more than man. The Man. Son of God. God the Son come down into the world out of the glory,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.660]   born of a woman, taking human nature unto Himself. Man, yes, but more. The Son of Man.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:08.420]   Second Adam. Second man, rather, last Adam. The Son of Man. The only hope for man.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:14.020]   The representative of man, the new humanity. The Son of Man. That's what he's saying. That's who
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:20.500]   he is, and he says that they, in their ignorance, are going to crucify and kill their long-awaited
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.020]   Messiah, the one who was to come. He says, "You're going to kill me." Why? Well, because you don't
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.060]   understand. They don't believe all this. They don't understand all this. In other words, he shows
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.820]   them here that they are fatally wrong about him and his death in two main respects. Let me just
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:45.860]   hold them before you briefly. Here is the first. He is telling them that they're wrong in thinking
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:55.620]   that his death will be the end of him and of all his claims. When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.620]   well, you'll think that then you got rid of me. I'm a nuisance to you. I'm not a Pharisee,
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.380]   but here I am talking about the law and expounding it, and you don't like it.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.980]   And you're beginning to think in your hearts, "We must get rid of this man." And then your
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.900]   next step will be to say, "If only we get rid of him, then we'll have some peace again. This man's
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.780]   a nuisance. He's an annoyance. He's a disturbance." So, when you have lifted up the Son of Man,
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.980]   you will say to yourselves, "Well, no, this is all right. We've got rid of him. That's the
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:29.860]   end of that imposter. Others he saved. Himself he can't save. Now, Son of God, come down from
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.980]   the cross, if thou art the Son of God. Why not save yourself? Come down." One of the thieves
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.100]   crucified with him, you remember, cast that very selfsame thing into his teeth, and they all mocked
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.820]   and jeered, and the crowd was much amused. Here is one who claims that he's Son of God,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:50.660]   and that he is Messiah. Look at him, dying in utter weakness. Marvelous. That's the end of him,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.780]   and all his claims, and all his bursting, and all his blasphemy. That's what they thought.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:01.460]   They thought, I say, that when they'd put him to death upon the cross, that it was
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:10.580]   the end of him, and the end of all his claims. It's not surprising that he looked upon them and
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:18.020]   said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." He meant it in one sense, but it's true
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:24.980]   in this sense also. He's telling them here. He says, "You think that when you kill me,
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:30.340]   you'll finish me. You have no idea what you're doing. You'll be lifting me up on a pole, yes,
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:36.180]   but you'll be doing more. In putting me to death, what are you doing? You're just elevating me back
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:42.420]   to my everlasting glory, and the throne of my Father." That's implied here.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:51.380]   But they knew nothing about that. They had no conception as to what his death would lead to.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:57.060]   As I'm reminding you, they thought that his death would just be the end of him,
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.860]   and all the end of these claims that he was making. But here he's telling them. He says,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.540]   "You know what my death's going to do? Once you've lifted up the Son of Man,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:11.620]   then all these truths concerning me are going to be manifested." What are they? Well, his death,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.460]   you see, immediately provided proofs as to who he is. He says so. "Then shall it be made known
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:25.620]   as to who I am, and that I am he, that I am the Son of Man." How does his death lead to that?
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.300]   Well, let me remind you very simply.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:33.060]   There was something very extraordinary about his death.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.740]   The moment he died, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:49.300]   That had never happened before. Who is this man? Who is this man they're getting rid of? Well,
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.700]   there's something strange about him. When he dies, the sun was darkened for three hours.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:00.740]   And the veil of the temple was rent, and afterwards the graves opened, and some of
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.660]   the people emerged out of the graves. Strange things. The centurion looking on said, "What's
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:13.620]   this? Who is this?" Truly, this was the Son of God. What men couldn't see in his life,
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.620]   they began to see in his death. There were manifestations indicating as to who he was,
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.060]   and the significance of his dying. But that's not the main evidence. Of course,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:30.100]   the main evidence is this. There is nothing that so proves his claims and the truth of
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.540]   everything that he has put forward concerning himself as that mighty event that followed his
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.860]   death. They kill him, and they say, "That's the end. Take down the body. Put it in a grave."
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.540]   Now, they say, "We must be careful. There will be rumors about this man. His followers will
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.180]   obviously concoct some stories." So they went to Pilate and got authority. They said, "Look here,
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.420]   we want a seal set on that grave, and we want you to appoint soldiers to guard." And they did all
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.900]   that. Read the account yourself at the end of chapter 27 and the beginning of chapter 28 of
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.100]   Matthew's Gospel. They said, "This imposter is quite likely to put suggestions into the minds
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.780]   of his followers, and they'll be very ready to put them into practice." "Very well," they said,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.340]   "make absolutely certain. Roll over a stone, seal it, put the guard." And they did it all.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.420]   But do you remember that they didn't achieve their end and object?
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.700]   Because the stone was rolled away, and his body disappeared from the grave.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.780]   No one knew it. No one understood it. What's this? Well, this is resurrection.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.220]   And this is the mightiest proof and demonstration of the fact that he is the Son of God,
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.220]   the Son of Man that he claims to be. This he, this prophet, this deliverer, this Messiah that
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:47.140]   all the prophets have looked forward to. He will be demonstrated to be such by the resurrection.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.940]   Well, I mustn't keep you, let me give you the evidence.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:56.340]   You know, it was the resurrection of Jesus Christ that finally convinced the
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:03.140]   disciples, the apostles themselves. Don't you remember how heartbroken and crestfallen they
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.980]   were after his death? They said, "We don't understand it. Look at his power in healing
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   diseases and raising the dead, but he's died in apparent weakness." They were utterly doubtful.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.420]   Look at two of them going on the road to Emmaus and saying, "We had thought that it was he
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:24.180]   that should have brought us deliverance and established the kingdom. We had thought so,
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.500]   but it's hopeless." They were all disconsolate, Peter and the rest. Do you remember Peter
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.620]   inviting some of them to go out fishing with him, not knowing what to do with himself,
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.180]   utterly downcast? Then suddenly they see him standing on the shore in the morning. "It is
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.980]   the Lord!" That's how they were convinced themselves, even his own disciples. Leave
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.660]   alone these other people. The resurrection proclaimed it. Do you remember the story of
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:51.060]   Thomas? Even when he's told by the others, "Thomas cannot believe it's true
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:59.460]   until the Lord comes into the room and says to Thomas, 'Come along, Thomas. Put your finger in
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.660]   the marks of the nails and thrust your hand into my side, and don't be unbelieving but believing.'
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.020]   And he falls at his feet saying, 'My Lord and my God.'"
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:15.860]   It is his death that does this, you see. Yes, they were almost believing it before. His words
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.660]   were wonderful, his miracles, but they were not enough. It was the resurrection following the
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:29.300]   death that really did it. He said it would, and it did. And so the apostle Paul reminds
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:36.820]   the Romans, you remember, at the beginning of his great epistle, that he was born of the seed of
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:45.700]   David according to the flesh, but declared to be the son of God according to the spirit of holiness
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:54.740]   by the resurrection from the dead. The proclamation is in the resurrection that he is son of God,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.380]   he is the first to rise from the dead. "You," he's telling these Jews, "I think that you're
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.220]   finishing me. That's the end of me and all my claims. Do you know what you're doing? You're
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:08.420]   going to prove that I am he. It's by the grave, the cross and the grave, that I'm going to be
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:18.180]   declared to be the son of God, that I am he." Resurrection. But there was something that even
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.260]   followed the resurrection that helped to prove it. What was that? The day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:31.540]   Right away through the Old Testament, God had promised that when the Messiah came he would
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:39.060]   pour out his spirit upon all flesh. It's seen most clearly in the prophecy of Joel in chapter 2,
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.420]   but it's there in others. It's there in Isaiah, it's there in Ezekiel, they've all got it in some
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.260]   shape or form. How shall we know when the Messiah has come? "Oh, then I will pour out of my spirit
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.380]   upon all flesh, your servants, your handmaidens, your old men, your young men, everybody,
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:01.220]   not on occasional men as now. There will be a prohusion, a pouring forth, a shedding forth of
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:12.020]   my spirit." And he himself had promised the same thing. He had told his followers, he said, "It is
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.980]   expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.900]   But if I go away, I will send him unto you." He says, "I'm not going to leave you orphans,
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.220]   I'm not going to leave you alone. I'll send you another Comforter. He, when he comes,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.260]   when the Spirit is come, he shall convince the world of sin and righteousness and of judgment."
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.300]   What a specific promise. He's putting his whole case into that one thing. He says, "If I am the
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.900]   Messiah, that's going to happen, but not until I die. But when I die, I will send him."
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:50.340]   And on the day of Pentecost, he did send him. "When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.740]   then shall it be known." And it was known on the day of Pentecost.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.260]   The promise of the Father has arrived. The thing that God said he was going to do through his
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:06.420]   chosen servant has taken place. Here is another proclamation that he is the Son of God. I am he,
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:16.420]   Spirit poured out upon the church. So, you see, he is telling them that far from putting an end to
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:22.020]   him and his claims, by killing him upon the cross, they'd be doing the exact opposite. They would be
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.340]   supplying proofs that he is the Son of God. But let me give it to you in another way.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:33.540]   He is telling them that not only will they supply the proofs in that way, but they will
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:41.620]   also release the power that he came to give. Power. What do I mean? Well, it's a further proof
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:54.580]   of who he is. Power to forgive sins. How has that power been released? He was here talking about it.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:01.060]   He had power to forgive sins himself while he was in this world. Yes, but you know,
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.540]   it wasn't during his life that this great power of his to forgive sins was manifested.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:11.300]   That was only made manifest after he died upon the cross. He had already told them,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:18.980]   I've reminded you, in John 3, verse 14, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:24.900]   must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:35.060]   everlasting life." Mankind, he says, is suffering from this terrible disease called sin. Even as
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.100]   those children of Israel in the wilderness were suffering from the snake poison, they were being
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.660]   bitten by snakes, and they were dying here and there and everywhere. And what was the cure?
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.140]   God said to Moses, "Take a brazen serpent, put it on a pole, hold it up, tell them to look,
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:55.060]   and one look will heal them." You know, says this person, I am the Son of Man, and what have I come
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.420]   into the world for? To heal mankind of sin, to take out the poison, to save them from death and
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:06.820]   destruction. I'm the one that's going to save them by being put up on a pole. Even so must the Son
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:13.700]   of Man be lifted up. And you know, my dear friends, you and I would not know forgiveness of sins
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:20.980]   tonight, and nobody would ever have been forgiven, were it not that this person was crucified on a
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:27.220]   tree on a hill called Calvary. What was he doing there? Well, says Paul to the Romans again in
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:34.020]   chapter 3, verse 25, "He is setting him forth as a propitiation for our sins, deliverance in his
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:39.460]   blood, that he may be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus." What was God doing
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:46.500]   on Calvary? He was setting him forth as the propitiation. You know, says our Lord to these men,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:53.380]   you think that by putting me to death you're refuting my claims that I am the Messiah,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:00.580]   that I am he. I say that I've come to deliver, I've come to save, and you say this is nonsense
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.500]   and blasphemy and you're going to kill me because of that. But you know, he says, the effect of your
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.700]   killing me will be this, you'll prove that I am. It's my blood that you're going to shed that's
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.460]   going to heal you. Here is forgiveness of sins, the power of forgiveness is going to be released
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.260]   through your act. You don't understand it, but that is God's way. That's what he's saying.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:27.780]   And not only the power to forgive sins, but the power to give life,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:37.060]   the power that was released, I say again at Pentecost. All the regenerating power of the
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:43.620]   Holy Spirit, all the renewing, all the strength and the might that he gives, here it comes from
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:50.900]   this blessed person. There is nothing in any Christian but that he receives it from Christ.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.700]   "We beheld his glory," says John in the very first chapter in verse 14 and 16,
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:03.940]   "glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." Yes, not only that,
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:13.300]   but we have received of his fullness and grace upon grace. His power, he couldn't give it to
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.580]   them while he was with them, and that's why they remained doubting even his own believers.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.540]   Look at these men before Pentecost. Look at them after Pentecost. What a transformation!
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.820]   What is it? Oh, he's come into them now, as it were. He's entered in fullness by the Spirit,
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.300]   and here they are filled with might and authority and power. What a transformation!
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:40.660]   How did it come about? Well, it was by his death. These men, he tells them, by killing him are just
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:46.340]   going to be releasing his power, the power that was released at Pentecost. And you see, our Lord
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:54.740]   had prophesied this again. He had told his disciples, you'll find it in the 14th chapter
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.060]   of this Gospel, that after he had gone, that they would not only do the works that he was doing,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.900]   but that they would do greater works than these, "because I am with the Father," he said.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:11.860]   And you know, after Pentecost, it began to happen. There were many more turning to God
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:19.300]   after Pentecost than even during his own ministry. There do not appear to be many conversions while
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.860]   he was here. He was but a man, as it were, and they didn't believe. They rejected him.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:29.140]   But after Pentecost and the power, the masses, three thousand on one day, and others followed.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.700]   What is this? Oh, it's a verification of his claim. The power has been released.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.860]   "Greater works than these shall you do, because I go unto my Father."
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:47.460]   And then take that claim which he makes in this 12th chapter of this Gospel of John, in verse 32.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:57.140]   "And I," he said, "if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me."
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:05.540]   What a claim. He was thought of as the Jewish Messiah. He says, "I'm not only Jewish,
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.580]   I'm going to draw all nations unto me." You remember the incident arose
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.500]   when those Greeks came along and said, "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:21.860]   And the reply he gave when he was asked to see them was this. He said, "No, not now.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:29.700]   Not now. But after I have been lifted up, after I'm crucified and died, then
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.740]   I will draw all men unto me." While he was here in the flesh, he appeared to be the Jewish Messiah,
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:41.620]   and that alone. He throws out his hints that he's the savior of the world, that he is the bread of
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.860]   life, and that he's the light of the whole world. Men couldn't take it. They couldn't follow it.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.660]   Oh, but after his death, after his resurrection, after Pentecost, do you remember what began to
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.980]   happen? Read your book of the Acts of the Apostles. They started in Jerusalem, as he said,
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:00.740]   then Samaria, then into the autonomous parts of the earth. The gospel spreads. Gentiles are saved.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:06.420]   The nations come in. All men, all nations he means, representatives of all nations,
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.580]   will come unto me. I will draw them unto myself. I will prove that I am the savior of the world.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.420]   He couldn't do it while he was here in the flesh.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.980]   But after his death and resurrection, and after Pentecost, he did do it,
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.900]   and that's what he's telling these men. "When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.220]   then it shall be known that I am he, that I am the Son of Man,
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.460]   that I am the Messiah and the Deliverer." Now, that's the first point he's making.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:40.340]   These people, he says, are tragically ignorant about his death.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:46.340]   They think that his death is the end of him and the end of all his claims.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.300]   He is telling them that it's going to work out in the exact opposite way,
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:58.500]   that it is via his death that all his claims are going to be proved. And they were.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:04.580]   But look for a moment at the second point. The second error was that they thought that
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.940]   his death would be the end of their relationship to him.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:17.140]   "Who is this fellow?" they say. "Who is this man that arrogates to himself such great powers and
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:22.180]   makes such stupendous claims? This carpenter, this fellow, this nonentity, who is he?"
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.980]   And they got so annoyed, they said, "Away with him. Let's get rid of him."
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.660]   They concocted a plot. They uttered their lies. They had no charge. There was nothing
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.700]   they could prove. But they lied and they encompassed his death. And they felt that
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.380]   if only they could thus get rid of him, well, it would not only be the end of him,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.820]   but still more important from their standpoint, it would be the end of their association with him.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.940]   It would be the end of their relationship to him.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.220]   If only they killed him, they'd have no longer any trouble with him.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:59.700]   He wouldn't be able to affect them or to annoy them or to do anything to them any longer,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.140]   not for another single moment. But you know, he tells them here this tremendous thing,
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:12.820]   "When you have lifted up the son of man, after that some time, you shall know that I am he.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:19.860]   You don't finish with me," he says, "when you crucify me."
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.660]   What's going to happen? Well, what's going to happen is this.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:32.820]   He says, "You shall know." How are they going to know? Well, listen to him putting the same
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:38.580]   thing in a slightly different manner as you find it recorded in the gospel according to St. Matthew
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.740]   in chapter 26 and in verse 64. Listen to this.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:50.420]   Here is our Lord speaking to the chief priest of the Jews, a man called Caiaphas.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:58.980]   They said, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:04.260]   three days.' And the high priest arose and said unto him, 'Answerest thou nothing?
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:13.700]   What is it which these witness against thee?' But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.500]   answered and said unto him, 'I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tellest whether thou
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:26.420]   be the Christ, the Son of God.' Then," listen, "Jesus saith unto him, 'Thou hast said. Nevertheless
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   I say unto you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power.'"
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.900]   In other words, on the right hand of God.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.380]   And that is what he is telling them at this particular point.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:58.100]   He is telling these Jews, "You don't believe in me now, and you think that by putting me to death,
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.540]   well, that you are finishing with me and that you will have no longer any trouble with me.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:07.220]   But you know," he said, "a day is coming when you shall see me seated at the right hand of glory and
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:14.580]   of God's power. I have come from God. I am going back to him. There is a vacant seat on the right
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.460]   hand of God. It belongs to me as his Son. I have left it in order to come into this world to save
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.220]   people like you. And you don't believe me, and you are rejecting me, and you think you are finishing
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:28.740]   your association, but you are not. You will see me there. Thou shalt see me seated at the right
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.540]   hand of power. I will be there. You are simply elevating me to the glory. You are translating
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.980]   me back to where I have come from. When you are lifting me up, you are not finishing. You are
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.140]   putting me back there. You are sending me back to the glory out of which I have emerged."
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:51.620]   And so, you see, he says the same thing to his disciples. After his resurrection,
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:56.900]   he tells them that he is sending them out to preach the gospel. He says, "Go ye, therefore,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.540]   and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:08.100]   teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And, lo, I am with you always,
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:14.180]   even unto the end of the world." How can he say that? Well, this is what he says before it.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:21.700]   Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:32.580]   That is the result of his crucifixion. His powers on earth were limited. He simply spoke what his
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.100]   Father told him to speak. "The works I do," he says, "are not of myself. They are the works that
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.660]   my Father has given me." But the moment they crucify him, what are they doing? Elevating
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:46.820]   him back to the glory. God handing it all over to him. "All power is given unto me in heaven and in
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.300]   earth. You Jews," he says, "you don't realize what you're doing. You don't end with me. You
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.580]   don't finish with me. When you kill me, you're sending me back to power illimitable, to glory
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:05.620]   everlasting." That's what you're doing. And you know, he'd manifested it to them fairly soon.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:14.820]   Do you remember what happened in A.D. 70, less than 40 years after his crucifixion?
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.980]   Well, what happened was this. The Roman armies and legionaries surrounded the city of Jerusalem.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:27.220]   There was a terrible war such as had never been seen—suffering, panic, pestilence, famine,
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.820]   and these horrible troops, and the city of Jerusalem being threatened. And the Jews,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.100]   at last, in terror, awaken, and they look for a Messiah, and they cry to God, "Why don't you send
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.660]   the Messiah? Why don't you send the one you've promised to send to deliver us?" He told them
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.660]   all about that here, didn't he? He told them, you remember, in this very section we are considering.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:52.980]   He said, "You shall seek me. You shall seek me and die in your sin. You won't be able to find me."
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.380]   They turned to God, and I say they pleaded with him, "Oh, why don't you send the Messiah to
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:02.820]   deliver us from these Roman armies and save our city? Send the Messiah!" And do you know the
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:10.580]   answer? He'd already been sent, but they had killed him and had crucified him. He'd been
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.780]   amongst them. He'd been in their city of Jerusalem. He'd spoken to them in their own temple. He'd
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:20.020]   offered himself. He said, "Believe. Follow. I'll deliver you. You'll no longer be in darkness.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.820]   I'll give you the light of life." He's come, but they didn't believe him. They rejected him,
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.500]   and therefore, when they crucify him, they think they're finishing, but they're not.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:35.540]   Why did that happen in A.D. 70? Oh, I can tell you why. Why was the city of Jerusalem destroyed
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.900]   and reduced to a mass of rubble? Why was the Jewish nation cast out of its ancestral home
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:46.020]   and thrown out amongst the nations where it remains until tonight? Why? There's only one
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:52.820]   answer. It was as punishment for their rejection of their own Messiah. They had been told that it
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.860]   would happen, and it did happen, so that in killing him they're bringing the Day of Judgment nearer.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.220]   They think they're finishing with him. They're not. They're bringing judgment down upon their
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:06.740]   heads. It came in A.D. 70, and it has abided upon them ever since as a nation.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:20.260]   But that isn't the end. These are but passing adumbrations of something that is going to happen.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.220]   What is that? Well, it is the thing, again, which our Lord himself said
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.580]   to that unbelieving Caiaphas. Listen.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:38.820]   "Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said. Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall he see the Son of
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:51.700]   Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven." And that is something
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:44:00.580]   that everybody is going to see. When you have lifted up the Son of Man, he says, "Then shall
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:12.180]   you know." When? "Then he will come on the clouds of heaven, surrounded by his holy angels." Coming?
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:17.700]   Coming what for? Coming to judgment. Listen to the revelation of John, chapter 1, verse 7.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:29.540]   "Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him. And they also which pierced him
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:41.140]   and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Every eye shall see him when he so comes.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:53.620]   He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him. Yea, and they also which pierced him."
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:02.420]   These Jews who rejected him, didn't believe in him, they'll see him in all his infinite glory
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:09.060]   and majesty and his transcendent personality. Every eye that has ever opened in this world
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:15.700]   shall see him, finish with him. You're only beginning with him when you reject him.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:21.860]   And though you crucify him, you're not finishing with him. You're elevating him to the glory,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:28.020]   to the majesty, and he'll come to judge. "And every eye shall see him, not one shall escape."
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:35.380]   But listen to this again in Revelation 6, 14 and following. "And the heaven departed as a scroll
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.860]   when it is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:45.380]   And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:51.060]   men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:59.220]   mountains and said to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us.'" Why? "Fall on us and hide us
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:08.420]   from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:17.620]   For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand it?"
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:26.020]   That's what he was telling these Jews when you have lifted up the Son of Man after you have done
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:33.140]   so. "You shall know." That's going to lead to the knowledge. How is it going to lead? Well,
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:44.420]   that's the ultimate. That's the end of it all. "You shall know that I am he.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:52.340]   You can reject the Son of God, but, my dear friend, you don't finish with him.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.780]   Every eye shall see him, yea, and they also which pierced him.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:07.540]   Kings, princes, great men, captains, bondmen, free men, all men,
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:18.980]   the whole world will see him, this Son of Man, Son of God."
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:25.300]   But, Sir Samuel, have you forgotten that you're alive in the 20th century?
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:30.900]   Have you forgotten that this is 1960? You're trying to frighten us. You're trying to alarm
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.780]   us. "My dear friend, I tell you before God that I'm not trying to frighten you at all.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:41.300]   I'm simply telling you the facts.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.580]   These people listening to our Lord didn't believe him.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:52.340]   They regarded it as rubbish and nonsense." That's what they said. "And it was because of that that
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.660]   they plotted together to kill him and finally did kill him." They said, "This is preposterous. This
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:01.460]   is nonsense. This is quite ridiculous. If only we kill him, we'll get rid of him. That's the end."
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:06.260]   And they did that, but it wasn't the end. And that's why we are here tonight.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:12.420]   "He had told them that his death would be followed by a resurrection."
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.740]   They didn't believe it. They scouted it. "That that would be followed by ascension." Nonsense.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.300]   "That he'd be seated at the right hand of God's glory and power, far from listening to him and
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.780]   believing and falling down and asking for forgiveness. 'Away with him,' they said. 'This
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:36.660]   is blasphemy.' But you know, it all happened. And it is he himself who has said, not I,
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.980]   that everybody shall see him seated at the right hand of power,
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:50.420]   that every eye shall see him when he comes on the clouds of heaven to judge the world in
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:57.220]   righteousness, to consign all who have rejected him to torment and hell and suffering, to set up
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:03.860]   his everlasting kingdom, to invite his people into it, and to enjoy eternity with him. He said it,
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:12.100]   it isn't I. If you believe in him at all, you believe everything he said.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:23.460]   It was he who said this, 'After you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you shall know.'"
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:29.140]   And my dear friend, I want to leave you with this thought this evening.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:36.340]   You are going to see the Son of God, and you can do nothing about avoiding it.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:43.060]   Every eye shall see him, and one glimpse of him will be enough to tell you that he
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:50.020]   is the Son of God and the Son of Man. You'll see his glory, his majesty. You'll see him riding on
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:55.620]   the clouds. You'll see the holy angels. You'll see a glimpse of his kingdom. You'll know there'll
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:02.740]   be no argument, there'll be no disputation. And if you didn't believe in him when you were in this
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:08.820]   world, it'll be the most terrible sight you've ever seen, because then you'll see that you were
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:14.500]   guilty of the most terrible and tragic blunder that a man can ever be guilty of. You rejected
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:20.740]   your Saviour, you rejected the Messiah, you've excluded yourself from the everlasting kingdom.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.060]   You shall see them coming, as he said himself, from the north and the south and the east and
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:32.420]   the west, and sitting down in the kingdom of God, with Abram and Isaac and Jacob and you yourselves,
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:38.900]   shut out, and shut out forever in torment and misery, while they
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.700]   are enjoying the blessings and the glories of the kingdom.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:53.140]   My dear friend, to reject Jesus Christ and his gospel and his offer, to refuse to run to him and
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:58.660]   to follow him and to walk in the light of his glory, which he has to give you, is nothing but
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:06.340]   sheer madness. You can go out of this service tonight infuriated, thinking that I'm mad,
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.020]   and that I'm just trying to frighten you, and that this is utter stuff and nonsense,
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.860]   which it's insulting to preach to people in 1960. Say what you will, my friend. If you say that,
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:22.820]   you're simply repeating what these people said. And it'll make no difference to the facts.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:33.220]   He has risen from the dead. He has ascended. He has sent his Spirit. He's proved his words.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:41.620]   And what yet remains is equally certain. Every one of us
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:48.340]   is going to see the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:52:00.420]   And that sight will be the most awful, terrifying, alarming sight that we've ever had,
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:09.780]   the wrath of the Lamb. Or else, it will be the most glorious experience that we've ever known.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:17.140]   We shall see him as he is, the one on whom we believe, and we shall immediately be changed.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.340]   In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the trump, we shall be transfigured and
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:30.100]   transformed, glorified even in body. We shall be like him. And we shall spend our eternity
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:38.420]   in his glorious presence. We saw last Sunday night that there are only two ways of dying.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:49.700]   We see tonight that there are only two ways of seeing him. Awful, unbelievable, indescribable.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:59.220]   Or else, glorious, wonderful. Oh, I plead with you, look at him tonight
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:06.180]   as he is here offering himself to you as the light of the world.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:13.140]   Though you've sinned and your sins be a scarlet, come to him. Though you've rejected him and
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:18.820]   scuffed him, at him all your life and sinned against him and gone your own way. Oh, I plead
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:26.340]   with you, come and look at him tonight. See him fall at his feet. Give yourself to him. Rise up
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.860]   and follow him. He won't refuse you. His heart is full of love. He's son of man. He's messiah,
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.860]   he's deliverer. The son of man, he says, has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:41.220]   He came and died for you. There's nothing he won't do for you. Come to him, ere it be too late.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:48.980]   And then you'll be able to look forward to the day of his coming as your own crowning day,
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:56.740]   the most glorious and wonderful day that will ever have dawned in your experience.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:02.420]   You don't finish with the Lord Jesus Christ when you say, I don't believe in him,
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.860]   don't bother me anymore. I've finished with him. You can't finish with him.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:14.180]   All power is given unto him. The universe belongs to him. He is its judge, and he will come again
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:21.060]   and judge it in righteousness. Make your peace with him. Kiss the son, lest he smite you. Make
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:26.900]   peace with him now, while there is an opportunity, while he is ready to receive you. Repent,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:33.300]   believe, be saved, and be made safe. Amen.
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:39.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
