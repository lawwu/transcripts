[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   "Grant, the videos were really inspiring.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.680]   You're the reason I'm going into grad school."
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.000]   And there's this little bell in the back of my mind
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.700]   that's like, "Do I want that?"
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.920]   (both laughing)
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.560]   To get more people going into math PhDs?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.920]   Math, academia, finance, and computer science
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.840]   almost certainly have an overallocation of talent.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.600]   Actually, I'm quite determined at some point
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   to be a high school math teacher for some number of years.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600]   Math lends itself to synthetic data,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.720]   how AlphaGo is trained.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.040]   You could have it produce a lot of proofs
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.600]   and just drain on a whole bunch of those.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   And the thing that takes, at most,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720]   30 minutes of the teacher's time, maybe even 30 seconds,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.760]   has these completely monumental rippling effects
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   for the life of the student they were talking to
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.760]   that then sets them on this whole different trajectory.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.800]   - Okay, today I have the pleasure
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   of interviewing Grant Sanderson
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.160]   of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.800]   You all know who Grant is.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.480]   I'm really excited about this one.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.160]   By the time that an AI model can get gold
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   in the International Math Olympiad,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760]   is that just AGI given the amount
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   of creative problem-solving and chain of thought
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.760]   required to do that?
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.400]   - I, to be honest, have no idea what people mean
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.120]   when they use the word AGI.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.840]   I think if you ask 10 different people
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.680]   what they mean by it,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.080]   you're gonna get 10 slightly different answers.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.060]   And it seems like what people want to get at
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.760]   is a discrete change that I don't think actually exists
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.360]   where you've got, okay, AI's up to a certain point.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.200]   They're not AGI.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.400]   They might be really smart, but it's not AGI.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.440]   And then after some point, that's the benchmark
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.560]   when like now it's generally intelligent.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.080]   The reason that world model doesn't really fit
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.600]   is it feels a lot more continuous
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.320]   where GPT-4 feels general in the sense
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   that you have one training algorithm
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320]   that applies to a very, very large set
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.700]   of different kinds of tasks
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.480]   that someone might want to be able to do.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.320]   And that's cool.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.480]   That's like an invention that people in the '60s
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.920]   might not have expected to be true
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.400]   for the nature of how artificial intelligence
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.920]   can be programmed.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100]   So it's generally intelligent,
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.600]   but maybe what people mean by, oh, it's not AGI
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120]   is you've got certain benchmarks
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.420]   where it's better than most people at some things,
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.880]   but it's not better at most people than others.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.600]   At this point, it's better than most people at math.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.320]   It's better than most people at solving AMC problems
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.720]   and like IMO problems.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   It's just not better than the best.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.220]   And so maybe at the point when it's getting gold in the IMO,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.480]   that's a sign that, okay, it's as good as the best
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.260]   and we've ticked off another domain,
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.960]   but I don't know, like is what you mean by AGI
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.800]   that you've enumerated all the possible domains
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.280]   that something could be good at
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.320]   and now it's better than humans at all of them?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.200]   - Or enough that it could take over substantial fractions
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   of human jobs or something.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.640]   Where right now it's impressive,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.240]   but it's not gonna be even 1% of GDP.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.400]   But in my mind, if it's getting gold in IMO,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.600]   I mean, having seen some of those problems
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.280]   from your channel, I'm thinking, wow,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   that's really coming after podcasters and video animators.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.760]   I don't know.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.740]   - I don't know, that feels orthogonal
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.880]   'cause getting a gold in the IMO feels a lot more
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.280]   like being really, really good at go or chess.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.880]   Like those feel analogous.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.440]   Well, it's super creative.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.960]   Like I think anyone who, I don't know chess as well
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   as the people who are into it,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.720]   but everything that I hear from them,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   the sort of moves that are made and choices
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.820]   have all of the air of creativity.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.960]   I think as soon as they started generating artwork,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.220]   then everyone else could appreciate,
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.100]   oh, there's something that deserves
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.140]   to be called creative here.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.120]   And the creative side of the math,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.180]   I don't know how it would look when people get them
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060]   to be getting golds at the IMO,
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.460]   but I imagine it's something that looks a little bit
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.700]   like how AlphaGo is trained,
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.620]   where you have it play with itself a whole bunch.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.380]   Math lends itself to synthetic data
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.460]   in the ways that a lot of other domains don't.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.820]   You could have it produce a lot of proofs
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.180]   in a proof-checking language, like Lean, for example,
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.580]   and just train on a whole bunch of those.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.660]   And like, is this a valid proof?
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.820]   Is this not a valid proof?
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.200]   And then counterbalance that
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.980]   with English written versions of something.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.820]   And so I imagine what it looks like
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.440]   once you get something that is solving
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.460]   these IMO level things.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.560]   One of two things, either it writes a very good proof
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.060]   that you feel like is unmotivated,
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.060]   'cause anyone who reads math papers has this feeling
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.380]   that there are two types.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.220]   There's the ones where you morally understand
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.540]   why the result should be true.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.900]   And then there's the ones where you're like,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.740]   I can follow the steps.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.180]   Why would you have come up with that?
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.740]   I don't know, but I guess that shows
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.980]   that the result is true.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.460]   And you're left wanting something a little bit more.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.100]   And so you could imagine if it produces that on the gold,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.660]   to get a gold in the IMO,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.860]   is that the same kind of ability
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.100]   as what is required to replace jobs?
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.420]   Just like, not really.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.940]   Like, the impediments between where it is now
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.580]   and replacing jobs feels like a whole different
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.940]   set of things, like having a context window
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.940]   that is longer than some small thing,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.940]   such that you can make connections over long periods
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.420]   of time and build relationships
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.060]   and understand where someone's coming from.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.580]   And the actual problem solving part of it,
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.340]   I mean, it's a sign that it would be a more helpful tool,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.700]   but in the same way that like Mathematica
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.580]   can help you solve math problems much more effectively.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.420]   - And tell me why I should be less amazed by it
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.580]   or maybe put it in a different context.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.100]   But the reason I would be very impressed
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.820]   is that with chess or something,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.340]   obviously this is not all the chess programs are doing,
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.540]   but there's a level of research you can do
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.180]   to narrow down the possibilities.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.980]   And more importantly, in the math example,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.020]   it seems that with some of the examples
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.900]   you've illustrated on your channel, for example,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.140]   the ability to solve the problem is so dependent
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.540]   on coming up with the right abstraction to think about it,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.380]   coming up with ways of thinking about the problem
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.900]   that are not evident in the problem itself
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900]   or in any other problem, in any other test.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.220]   That seems different from just a chess game
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.300]   where you don't have to like,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.500]   what is the largest structure of this chess game
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.820]   in the same way as you do with the IML problem?
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.620]   - I think you should ask people
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.740]   who know a lot about Go and chess,
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.340]   and I'd be curious to hear their opinions on it
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.260]   because I imagine what they would say is,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.420]   if you're gonna be as good at Go as AlphaGo is,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.420]   you're also not doing tree search, at least exclusively.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.580]   It's not dependent on something as growth in that
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.620]   'cause you get this combinatorial explosion,
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.100]   which is why people thought that game
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.140]   would be so much harder for so much longer.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.940]   There sort of has to be something
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.500]   like a higher level structure in their understanding.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.780]   And then, don't get me wrong, I would be super impressed
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.940]   and like anticipate being very impressed
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.700]   when you get AIs that can solve these IML problems
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.340]   because you're absolutely right,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.220]   there's a level of creativity involved.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.900]   The only claim I'm making is that being able to do that
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.340]   feels distinct from the impediments between,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.220]   I don't know, where we are now
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.740]   and the AIs take over all of our jobs or something.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.940]   It just, it seems like it's gonna be another one
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.900]   of those boxes that's this historic moment
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.700]   analogous to chess and Go,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.980]   more so than it's gonna be analogous
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.820]   to the Industrial Revolution.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.260]   - I'm surprised you wouldn't be more compelled.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.100]   - I am compelled.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.820]   - Right, or just you don't think that skill of,
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.060]   this problem is isomorphic to this completely different way
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.220]   of thinking about what's happening in the situation.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.660]   And here's me going through the 50 steps
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.140]   to put all that together into this one proof.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.500]   I'm surprised you don't think that's upstream
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.940]   of a lot of valuable tasks.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.580]   - I think it's a similar level of how impressed I was
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.820]   with the stable diffusion type stuff
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.820]   where you ask it give me a landscape of beautiful mountains,
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.060]   but made out of like quartz and gemstones or something.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.100]   And it gives you this thing
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.860]   which has all of the essence of a landscape,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.340]   but it's not literally a landscape.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.540]   And so you realize, okay, there's something,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.580]   something beyond the literal that's understood here.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.620]   And like, that's very impressive.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.620]   And in the same way to solve one of these math problems
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.580]   that requires creativity,
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.100]   you can't just go from the definitions.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.540]   You're 100% right.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540]   You need this element of lateral thinking,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.660]   which is why we find so much joy
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.620]   in finding the solutions ourselves
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.020]   or even just seeing other people get those solutions.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.860]   It's exactly the kind of joy that you get
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.420]   out of good artistic analogies and comparisons
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.940]   and mixing and matching.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.020]   I'm very impressed by all of that.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.780]   It's just, I think it's in the same category
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.460]   and it's maybe I don't have the same opinions
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.900]   as a lot of other people with this hard line
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.020]   between there's pre-AGI and post-AGI.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.820]   Like, I just don't know what they mean by the word AGI.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.980]   And I don't think that you're gonna have something
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.860]   that's this measurable discrete step,
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.180]   much less that a math tournament is gonna be an example
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.820]   of what that discrete step would look like.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.580]   - Interesting, interesting.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.940]   Okay, applied mathematicians.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.540]   Where do we put them in society
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.260]   where they can have the biggest benefit?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.020]   We like a lot of them go into computer science and IT
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.820]   and I'm sure there's been lots of benefits there,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.420]   but where are there other parts of society
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.420]   where you just have a whole bunch of mathematicians go in
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.460]   and they can make things a lot better?
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.580]   I don't know, transportation or logistics or manufacturing,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.220]   but where else do you think they might be useful?
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.500]   - That's such a good question.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.940]   In some ways, I'm like the worst person to ask about that,
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940]   but this isn't gonna answer your question,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.740]   but instead it's gonna like fan the flames
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.820]   of why I feel it's an important question.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.380]   I have actually been thinking recently
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.780]   about if it's worth making an out-of-typical video
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.020]   that's specifically addressed it,
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.940]   like inspiring people to ask that,
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.820]   especially students who are graduating.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   'Cause I think this thing happens
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.740]   where when you fall in love with math
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.420]   or some sort of technical field,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.460]   by default in school, you study that,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.940]   and when you're studying that,
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.940]   effectively you're going through an apprenticeship
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.900]   to be an expert in that or a researcher in that.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.740]   The structure of studying physics in a university
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.060]   or math in a university,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.660]   even though they know that not all majors
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.340]   are gonna go into the field,
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.660]   the people that you're gaining mentorship from
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.980]   are academics and are researchers in the field,
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.300]   so it's hard not to effectively be apprenticing in that.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.940]   And I also have noticed that when I go
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.100]   and give talks at universities or things like this,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.900]   and students come up after and they're like saying hi,
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.740]   there's a lot of them that are like,
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.100]   "Grant, the videos were really inspiring,
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.820]   "like you're the reason that I studied math,
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.260]   "or that you're the reason I'm like going into grad school."
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.620]   And there's this little bell in the back of my mind
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.100]   that's like, "Cool, cool, I'm amazed.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.060]   "I don't know if I believe I was wholly responsible for it,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.100]   "but like cool to have that impact."
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.420]   Do I want that?
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.580]   (laughing)
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.860]   Is this a good thing to get more people
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.620]   going into math PhDs?
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.260]   On the one hand, I unequivocally want more people
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.740]   to self-identify as liking math, that's very good.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.620]   But those who are doing that necessarily get shuffled
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.140]   into the traditional outlets, like math academia.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.540]   Yeah, I think you highlight it very right.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.980]   It's like math academia, finance, and computer science,
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.180]   data science, something in there in general,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.540]   are very common things to go to.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.140]   And as a result, they almost certainly
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.620]   have an over-allocation of talent.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.140]   All three of those are valuable, right?
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.780]   I'm not saying those are not valuable things to go into,
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.740]   but if you were playing God and shifting around,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.700]   where do you want people to go?
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.700]   Again, I'm not answering your question.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.300]   I'm just asking it in other words
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.820]   'cause I don't really know.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.540]   I think you should probably talk to the people
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.900]   who made that shift, of which there aren't a huge number,
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.180]   but like Eric Lander is maybe one good example.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.700]   Jim Simons would maybe be another.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.580]   Whereas people who were doing a very purely academic thing
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.580]   and then decided to shift to something very different.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.620]   Now, I have sort of had this thought
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.500]   that it's very beneficial to insert some forcing function
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.300]   that gets the pure mathematicians
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.540]   to spend some of their time in a non-pure math setting.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.420]   NSF grants coming with a requirement
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.500]   that 10% of your time goes towards a collaboration
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.780]   with another department or something like that.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.700]   The thought being these are really good problem solvers
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.820]   in a specific category of problems,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.420]   and to just distribute that talent elsewhere
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.620]   might be helpful.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.540]   And when I run this by mathematicians,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.140]   sometimes there's a mixed response where they're like,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.780]   "Ah, I don't know if we'd be all that useful."
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.260]   Like there's a sense that the aesthetic
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.540]   of what constitutes a good math problem
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.540]   is by its nature rooted in the purity of it,
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.660]   such that it's maybe a little elitist to assume
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.460]   that just because people are really, really good
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.060]   at solving that kind of problem,
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.260]   that somehow their abilities are more generalizable
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.340]   than other people's abilities.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.900]   Why ask about the applied mathematicians
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.260]   rather than saying shouldn't the applied biologists
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.620]   go and work in logistics and things like that?
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.220]   'Cause they also have a set of problem-solving abilities
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.700]   that's maybe generalizable.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.660]   In the back of my mind, I think,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.860]   "No, but the mathematicians are special.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.900]   There really is something general about math."
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.980]   So I don't have the answers.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.420]   I will say I'm actually very curious to hear from people
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.700]   for what they think the right answers are,
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.260]   or from people who made that switch.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.660]   Let's say they were a math major,
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.940]   or something adjacent like computer science, physics,
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.580]   and then they decided that they wanted to pour themselves
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.820]   into something, not because that was the academic itch
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.180]   that they were scratching by being good at school
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.420]   and getting to appreciate that,
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.620]   but because they stepped back and said,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.820]   "What impact do I wanna make on the world?"
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.060]   I'm hungry for more of those stories
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.660]   because I think it could be very compelling
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.500]   to convey those specifically to my audience
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.860]   who is probably on track to go
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.860]   into just the traditional math-type fields,
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.980]   and maybe there's room to have a little bit of influence
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.780]   to disperse them more effectively.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.620]   But I don't know.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.020]   I don't know what more effectively looks like
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.380]   'cause at the end of the day, I'm a math YouTuber, right?
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.220]   I'm not someone who has a career in logistics
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.660]   or manufacturing or all of these things
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.060]   in such a way that I can have an in-tune feel
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.180]   for where is there a need
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.820]   for this specific kind of abstract problem solving.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.020]   - It might be useful to speculate on how an undergrad
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.020]   or somebody who's a young math whiz
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.500]   might even begin to contemplate,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.740]   "Here's where I can have an edge."
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.100]   I'm remembering, actually, it just occurred to me,
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.860]   a former podcast guest, Lars Dusat,
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.860]   he was a game designer, actually,
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.300]   and he started learning about Georgism,
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.540]   which is this idea that you should tax land and only land.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.580]   And so he got really interested
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.180]   in not only writing about those ideas,
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.620]   but also with, well, if you're gonna tax land,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.540]   you had to figure out what the value of land is,
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.660]   or how do you figure out the value of land?
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.740]   There's all these algorithms of how you do this optimally
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.260]   based on neighboring land and how to average across land,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.300]   and there's a lot of intricacies there.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.860]   And so he now has a startup
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.900]   where he just contracts with cities
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.780]   to implement these algorithms
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.580]   to help them assess the value of their land,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.380]   which makes property taxes much more feasible.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.300]   That's another example, right,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.900]   where the motivation was more philosophical,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.620]   but his specialty as a technical person
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.740]   helped him make a contribution there.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.580]   - I think that's perfect.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.420]   Probably the true answer
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.860]   is that you're not gonna give a universal thing.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.820]   For any individual,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.300]   it's gonna be based on where their life circumstances
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.820]   connect them into something,
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.260]   either 'cause he had an interest in Georgism
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.140]   for whatever reason,
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.780]   but if someone, I don't know,
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.420]   their dad runs a paper mill
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.540]   and they're connected to the family business in that way
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.020]   and realize they can plug themselves
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.660]   in a little bit more efficiently,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.500]   you're gonna have this wide diversity
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.660]   of the ways that people are applying themselves
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.140]   that does not take the form of general advice
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.180]   given from some podcast somewhere,
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.460]   but instead takes the form of simply inviting people
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.780]   to think critically about the question
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.500]   rather than following the momentum
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.380]   of what being good at school implies about your future.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.140]   - We were talking about this before the interview started,
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.820]   but we have a much better grasp on reality
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.740]   based on our mathematical tools,
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.980]   and I'm not talking about anything advanced,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.620]   literally just being able to count in the decimal system
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.820]   that even the Romans didn't have.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.580]   How likely do you think it is
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.460]   that something that significant
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.060]   would be enjoyed by our descendants
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.460]   in hundreds or thousands of years?
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.420]   Or do you think that that kind of basic
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.300]   numeracy level stuff,
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.580]   those kinds of thinking tools are basically all gone?
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.980]   - Just so I understand the question right,
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.700]   you're talking about how having a system for numbers
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.140]   changes the way that we think,
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.220]   that then lends itself to a better understanding
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.060]   of the world.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.100]   Like we can do commerce and things like that.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.100]   Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.180]   It would have been hard to think,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.420]   we have the word orders of magnitude
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.940]   in a way that is hard to write down,
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.780]   much less think about if you're doing Roman numerals.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.780]   Like is there something analogous to that for our descendants?
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:01.220]   I mean, fluency with a programming interface
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.900]   really can help understanding certain problems.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.500]   I think when people mess around in a notebook with something
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.460]   and when it feels like a really good tool set,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.820]   there's a way that that has the same sensation
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.340]   as adopting a nice notation,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.140]   in that you write something with a small number of symbols,
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.980]   but then you discover a lot about the implication of that.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.220]   In the case of notation,
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.500]   it's because the rules of algebra are very constrained.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.620]   And so when you write something,
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.460]   you can go through an almost game-like process
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.500]   to see how it reduces and expands
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.900]   and then see something that might be non-trivial.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.580]   And in the case of programming,
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.540]   of course the machine is doing the crunching
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.460]   and you might get a plot that reveals some extra data.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.860]   I think we may be at a phase where there's room for that
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.340]   to become a much more fluid process,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.140]   such that rather than having these small little bits
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.180]   of friction, like you've got to set up the environment
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.300]   and you've got to get in the notebook,
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.860]   you've got to find the right libraries,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.660]   that there's something that feels as fluid
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.220]   as when you are good at algebra
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.260]   and you're just at a whiteboard, kind of noodling it out.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.820]   I think there's something to be said for the fact
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.340]   that there's still so much more value in...
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.980]   If you and I were going to go into some math topic
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.820]   right now, right?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.620]   You ask me something that's a terrible question
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.460]   for a podcast, but I'm like,
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.260]   "Oh, let's actually dig into it."
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.980]   The right medium to do that is still paper, I think.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.540]   I would break out some paper and we would scribble it out.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.660]   And so whenever it becomes the case
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.220]   that the right medium to do that lends itself
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.900]   to simulation and to programming and all that,
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.940]   that feels like it would get to the point
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.260]   where it shifts the way that you even think about stuff.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.700]   - Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.180]   What's up with miracle years?
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.100]   So this is something that has happened throughout science
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.780]   and especially with mathematicians,
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.060]   where they have a single year in which they wake up many,
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.700]   if not most of the important discoveries
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.300]   that they have in their career.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.140]   You know, Newton, Einstein, Gauss,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.980]   they all had these years.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.540]   Do you have some explanation of what's going on?
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.500]   - What's your take?
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.740]   - I think there's a bunch of possible explanations.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.780]   It can't just be youth,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.980]   because youth last 10 years, not one year.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.540]   So it must have something to do with...
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.580]   - To be 35-year-old right now is like...
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.180]   (both laughing)
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.020]   How dare you?
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.540]   - You know what I mean.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.380]   - 20 years.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.300]   - Yeah.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.500]   - So yeah, it can't just be that.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.300]   I don't know.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.220]   There's a bunch of possible things you could say.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.540]   One is you're in a situation in life
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.380]   where you have nothing else going for you,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.540]   or you're just like really free for that one year,
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.540]   and then you become successful after that year is over,
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.900]   based on what you did.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.700]   Yeah, but what is your take?
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.820]   - I don't know.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.780]   So I agree that's probably multiple factors, not one.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.620]   One thing could be that the miracle year
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.860]   is the like exhalation,
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.580]   and there's been many, many years of inhalation,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.780]   where often, let's say the classic one is Einstein's,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.340]   where his miracle year were also some of the first papers,
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.340]   like kind of springing onto the scene.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.220]   And I would guess that a lot of the ideas
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.380]   were not bumping around his head only in that year,
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.260]   but it's like many, many years of thinking about it
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.540]   and kind of coalescing.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.380]   And so you might be in a position
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.700]   where you can build up all of this potential energy,
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.740]   and then for whatever reason,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.300]   there's one time in life that lends itself
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.980]   to actually releasing all of that.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.540]   If I try to reflect on like my own history
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.900]   with what I'm doing now,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.980]   I think I didn't appreciate early on
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.380]   how much potential energy I was working from
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.820]   simply from being a student and in college,
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.060]   where there's just a bunch of ways of thinking about things,
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.500]   or empathy with new learners, or just cool concepts, right?
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.660]   The basic concept behind a video,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.780]   that in fact, it was many, many years
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.140]   of like all of my time having learned math
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.380]   before I started putting out stuff online
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.060]   that I was able to eat into.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.340]   And then maybe it was a little later where,
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.780]   okay, the well never runs dry.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.180]   There's always a long list of things that I want to cover.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.860]   But in some sense, like I recognize that the well
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.660]   was at risk of running dry in a way
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.260]   that I never thought that it could.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.140]   And without being a little deliberate
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.700]   about devoting some of my day,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.660]   not just to output and producing,
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.460]   but to stepping back and like learning new things
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.380]   and touching something I never would have.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.020]   That doesn't happen by default.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.540]   I don't know if this is also the case
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.820]   for the people who have genuine miracle years
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.300]   where they were like letting out all of this stuff.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.740]   And then it takes a decade to build up
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.140]   that same level of potential energy.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.900]   The other thing, you have everything to gain
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.500]   and nothing to lose when you are young.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.380]   So even if it's not merely youth,
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.660]   there's a willingness to be creative.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.700]   And there's also none of the obligations
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.580]   that come from having found success before, right?
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.780]   You know, there's certain academics
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.780]   who made an extremely deliberate effort not to let,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.620]   what do they call it?
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.740]   Is it like the curse of success or?
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.580]   There's some term for it,
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.420]   but I think maybe it was James Watson,
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.660]   you know, had this standard reply to invitations
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.100]   for, you know, talks and interviews and things like that.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.180]   It was basically like no to everyone
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.460]   because I just want to be a scientist.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.740]   It was much more articulate than that.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.260]   And he has all these nine points,
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.700]   but that was the gist of it.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.460]   And short of doing that,
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.660]   I think it's very easy for someone
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.700]   to have a lot of other things
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.940]   that eat into their mind share and time and all of that,
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.900]   that even if it's just 20 hours a week,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.020]   like actually that really interrupts a creative flow.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.420]   - Were you a student when you started the channel?
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.500]   - Technically, yeah.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.900]   The very, very first video was made
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.340]   when I was a senior at Stanford.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.060]   Basically I had been like toying around
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.620]   with just a personal programming project
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.700]   in my last year of college
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.700]   that was the beginnings of what is now
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.540]   like the animation tool I work with.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.740]   I didn't intend for it to be a thing
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.700]   that I would use as a math YouTuber.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.740]   I didn't even really know what a YouTuber was.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.220]   It was really just like a personal project.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.260]   And it was March of that year,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.740]   I think that I published the first ever video.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.260]   And so it was kind of right at that transition point.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.300]   - Do you think you would have done it
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.100]   if you had, let's say become,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.140]   I don't know what you were planning on doing after college.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.100]   I remember you saying somewhere,
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.660]   maybe a data scientist, but.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.140]   - Data scientist and math PhD
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.180]   were the two like 50/50 contenders basically.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.020]   - Is there a role in which you started doing that,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.780]   but then later on made Manim?
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.940]   Or do you think that that was only possible
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.380]   in a world where you had some time to kill
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.580]   in your senior year?
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.780]   - If the goal was to make math YouTube videos,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.540]   it would have been a wild thing to do,
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.340]   to do it by like making Manim as the method for it,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.260]   because it looks so strikingly inefficient
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.820]   to do it that way.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.380]   At the very least, it probably would have built
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.180]   on top of an existing framework.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.260]   If I had, I mean, there's so many things
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.260]   that I would tell my past self if I could go back in time,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.500]   even if the goal was to make that,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   it's like certain design decisions that caused pain
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.060]   that could have been fixed earlier on.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.420]   But if the goal was to make videos,
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.220]   there's just so many good tools for making videos,
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.140]   I probably would have started with those.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.820]   Or if I wanted to script things,
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.100]   maybe I would have first learned After Effects
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.020]   really effectively and then learned the scripting languages
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.260]   around After Effects.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.900]   That might've even been better for all I know.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.740]   I really don't know,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.820]   but I just kind of walked into it
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.020]   because the initial project was to make something
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.980]   that could illustrate certain ideas in math,
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.500]   especially when it came to visualizing functions
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.620]   as transformations, mapping inputs to outputs,
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.300]   as opposed to graphing.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.420]   The video output was just a way of knowing
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.220]   that I had completed that personal project in some sense.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.580]   And then it turned out to be fun
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.340]   because I also really enjoy teaching
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.140]   and really enjoy tutoring and stuff.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.020]   I don't know.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.580]   Then again, there's a lot of other people
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.540]   who make their own tools for math GIFs
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.900]   and little illustrations and things,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.940]   which on the one hand feels very inefficient.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.060]   Like there's, I don't know,
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.700]   if people come across a math GIF on Wikipedia,
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.940]   there's a very high probability
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.540]   it comes from this one individual
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.100]   who just strangely prolific
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.060]   at producing these creative commons visuals.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.620]   And he has his own home-baked thing for how he does it.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.660]   And then there's someone who I came across on Twitter,
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.580]   Matt Henderson, who has these completely beautiful
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.180]   math GIFs and such.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.700]   And again, it's a very home-baked thing
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.300]   that is like built on top of shaders,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.180]   but he kind of has his own stuff there.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.380]   And maybe there's something to be said
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.060]   for the level of ownership that you feel
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.980]   once it is your own thing
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.860]   that just unlocks a sense of creativity
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.100]   and feeling like, hey, I can just describe whatever I want
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.380]   because if I can't already do it,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.180]   I'll just change the tool to make it able to do that.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.020]   For all I know, that level of creative freedom
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.780]   is necessary to like take on a wide variety of topics.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.460]   But your guess is as good as mine for those counterfactuals.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.900]   - Yeah, this is personally interesting to me
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.820]   because I also started the podcast in college
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.100]   and it just like was off track of anything
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.300]   I was planning on doing otherwise.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.140]   And this is many, many orders of magnitude away
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.260]   from "3Blue1Brown."
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.500]   I don't want the audience to cringe in unison,
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.140]   but I just think it's interesting,
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.540]   like these kinds of projects,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.980]   how often something that, I don't know,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.460]   later on ends up being successful
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.380]   is something that was started almost on a whim
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.180]   as a hobby when you're in college or something like that.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.060]   - I will say there's a benefit to starting it
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.500]   in a way that is low stakes,
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.700]   like you're not banking on it growing.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.500]   I had no anticipation of, much less an expectation
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.860]   of "3Blue1Brown" growing.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.540]   I think the reason I kind of kept doing it
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.500]   was in the fork of life if I did the math PhD and all that,
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.900]   I thought it might be a good idea
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.860]   to have a little bit of a footprint on the internet
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.540]   for math exposition.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.140]   I was thinking of it as like a very niche thing
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.220]   that maybe some math students
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.020]   and some people who are into math would like it,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.260]   but I could sort of show the stuff as a portfolio,
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.580]   not as an audience size that was meaningful.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.100]   And I think I was surprised by what an appetite there was
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.300]   for the kind of things that I was making.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.100]   And in some ways, maybe that's helpful
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.340]   because I see a lot of people who jump in,
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.420]   they jump in with the goal of being a YouTuber.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.100]   I think it's the most common desired job among the youth
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.980]   is to be like a TikToker or a YouTuber,
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.500]   which think of that what you will,
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.700]   but when you jump in with that as a goal,
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.420]   you kind of aim for too large an audience
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.500]   and end up making the content, which is best for no one.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.620]   'Cause one, you're probably not that good
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.580]   at making videos yet.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.660]   And so you're competing,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.060]   if it's a generally applicable idea,
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.020]   you're competing with like all of the other communicators
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.380]   out there.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.140]   Whereas if you do something that's almost unreasonably niche
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.300]   and also you're not expecting it to blow up,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.940]   it's like one, you're not gonna be disappointed.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.260]   It's like outstanding when a thousand people view it
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.980]   as opposed to being disappointing.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.740]   And then two, you might be making something
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.340]   that is the best possible version of that content
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.820]   for the audience who watches it
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.860]   because no one else is making that for them
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.620]   'cause it's too narrow a target.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.780]   And that's sort of the beauty of the internet
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.180]   is that there's an incentive to do that.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.740]   And I don't know if this is the case with your podcast
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.900]   when you're starting off where not thinking about,
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.540]   oh, how can I make this as big as possible,
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.460]   actually made it more in-depth
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.420]   for those who were listening to it.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.100]   - Is it surprising to you that prehistoric humans
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.340]   don't seem to have had just basic arithmetic and numeracy?
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.820]   To me, with a sort of, I guess to us
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.060]   with the modern understanding,
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.660]   that kind of stuff seems so universally useful
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.780]   and so fundamental that it's shocking
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.620]   that it just doesn't come about naturally
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.060]   in the course of interacting with the world.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.420]   Do you think it's, is that surprising
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.700]   that it's just a concept of numbers?
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.660]   - You're right, it's so in our bones
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.940]   that it's hard to empathize with not having numeracy.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.980]   A lot of it's linked to, if you think, okay,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.660]   what's the first place that people think about numbers?
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.380]   Most people in their daily lives,
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.100]   it's linked to commerce and money and such.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.900]   So maybe some ways the question is the same as saying,
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.980]   is it surprising that early humanity didn't have commerce
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.700]   or didn't deal with money?
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.500]   Maybe when you're below Dunbar's number in your communities,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.380]   like a tit for tat structure just makes a lot more sense
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.420]   and actually works well and it would just be obnoxious
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.660]   to actually account for everything.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.820]   - The other loosely related idea,
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.020]   have you come across those studies
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.380]   where when anthropologists will interview tribes of people
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.620]   that are removed enough from normal society
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.820]   that they don't have the level of numeracy that you or I do,
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.220]   but there's some notion of counting.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.860]   You have one coconut or nine coconuts,
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.980]   like you have a sense of that,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.060]   that if you ask what number is halfway between one and nine,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.620]   those groups will answer three,
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.220]   whereas you or I or people in our world
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.940]   would probably answer five.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.460]   And because we think on this very linear scale,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.020]   it's interesting that evidently the natural way
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.180]   to think about things is logarithmically,
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.940]   which kind of makes sense.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.180]   Like the social dynamics as you go from solitude
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.660]   to a group of 10 people to a group of 100 people
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.340]   have roughly equal steps in increasing complexity
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.300]   more so than if you go from like one to 51 to 102.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   And I wonder if it's the case that by adding numeracy
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.020]   in some senses, we've also like lost some numeracy
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.420]   or lost some intuition in others,
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.460]   where now if you ask, you know, middle school teachers,
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.860]   what's a difficult topic to teach
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.180]   or for students to understand, they're like logarithms.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.300]   But that should be deep in our bones, right?
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.700]   So somehow it got unlearned and then needs to be,
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.780]   maybe it's in the formal sense
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.820]   that it's harder to relearn it,
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.740]   but there's maybe a sense of like numeracy
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.500]   and a sense of quantitative thinking
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.300]   that humans naturally do have that is hard to appreciate
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.140]   when it's not expressed in the same language
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.580]   or in the same ways.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   - Yeah, I have seen the thing from Joseph Henrich
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.020]   where the still existing tribes
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.140]   where they're in this kind of situation,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.420]   they can do numeracy and arithmetic
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.100]   when it's in very concrete terms,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.860]   if you're talking about seeds or something,
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.260]   but the abstract concept of a number
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.740]   is not available to them.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.980]   - Do you think the abstract concept of a number
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.140]   is useful to your life?
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:37.980]   - Oh yeah.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.580]   - Like in what ways?
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.700]   - It's almost like asking
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.020]   how is the concept of the alphabet useful?
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.620]   It comes up so often that it's,
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.500]   I mean, just like how many lights do I set up
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.980]   for this interview, right?
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.180]   - Is that the concept of an abstract number though?
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.100]   'Cause it's like two people, two lights,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.860]   one to one correspondence.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.860]   Did you leverage the abstraction of two as a object,
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.460]   which is simultaneously a rational and a real
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.780]   and an integer? - I see.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.180]   - Is in the context of a group that has additive structure,
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.020]   but also multiply, there's light for you, light for me.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.620]   - Right, yeah.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.260]   - I'm pretty sure the abstract idea of a number
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.260]   is important for all of us,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.140]   but I don't think it's immediately obvious.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.900]   It's more that it shapes the way we think.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.580]   I'm not sure if it actually changes the way we live.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.980]   If you're assuming you don't work in STEM, right?
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.820]   Where you literally are using it all the time.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.260]   - Yeah, I'm trying to go through my day
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.500]   and think through where am I using them?
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.980]   I mean, there's the obvious stuff,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.100]   like the commerce examples you mentioned
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.180]   where you go to a restaurant
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.420]   and you're figuring out what to pay or what to tip.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.380]   But that seems a very particular example.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.620]   Do I really use numbers that infrequently?
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.620]   - I don't know, yeah.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.860]   Many people listening are probably screaming
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.940]   out of their heads with much more apt examples,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.740]   but it's hard to say. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.100]   When a mathematician is working on a problem,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.660]   what is the biggest mental constraint?
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.820]   Is it working memory?
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.620]   Is it processing speed?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.700]   Plants are limited by nitrogen usually.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.820]   What is the equivalent of nitrogen for a mathematician?
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.100]   - Oh, that's a fun question.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.220]   I mean, so I'm not a research mathematician.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.700]   I shouldn't pretend like I am.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.260]   And so the right people to ask that question
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.780]   would be the research mathematicians.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.060]   I wonder if you're gonna get consistent answers.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.580]   As with so many things, there's not one.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:33.860]   Maybe the number of available analogies
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.060]   to be able to draw connections,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.300]   like the more exposure you've had to disparate fields
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.420]   such that you could maybe see,
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.380]   oh, a problem-solving approach that was used here
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.740]   might be useful here.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.460]   Sometimes that's literally codified
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.300]   in the forms of connections between different fields
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.100]   as functors between categories or something like that.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.020]   But sometimes it's a lot more intuitive,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.220]   the idea that a general flavor of,
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.460]   someone's doing a combinatorics type question
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.020]   and they're like, oh, maybe generating functions
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   are this useful tool to bring to bear.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.820]   And then in some completely different context
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.620]   of studying like prime numbers,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.500]   they're like, oh, maybe it could take
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.860]   a generating function type approach.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.660]   Maybe you have to massage it to make it work.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.500]   And one of the reasons I say this
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.780]   is one of the tendencies that you've seen in math papers
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   in, let's say, like the last 200 years,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.260]   the typical number of authors
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   is like much bigger now than before.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   People have this, I think, misconception
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.460]   that math is a field with lone geniuses who are off,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.980]   like coming up with great insights,
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.420]   like a loan next to a blackboard.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.460]   And the reality is it's a highly collaborative field.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.500]   I remember one of the first times
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.300]   that I was hearing from a mathematician,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.940]   it's like a young kid and I was in this math circles event
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.060]   and someone was asking this person like,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.780]   what surprised you about your job?
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.860]   That the first thing he said was how much travel
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.420]   was involved, that he wasn't expecting that.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.740]   And it's because if you're studying
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.660]   some very specific niche field,
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.740]   that the way that you make progress in that
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.060]   is by collaborating with other people in that field
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.740]   or maybe adjacent to that field.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.180]   And there's only so many about them.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.780]   They probably aren't at your university,
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.180]   so you travel a lot to work with them.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.300]   These days, a lot of that I think happens on Zoom,
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.300]   but conferences are still super important
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.020]   and these sorts of events that bring people
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.820]   all under one roof, like MSRI is maybe an example
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.300]   of a place that does that systematically.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:22.700]   And you could say that's a social thing, get more ideas,
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.300]   but I think it's maybe hitting on this idea
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.420]   that what you want is exposure
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.060]   to as many available analogies.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.140]   So the short answer to your question
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.900]   is the nitrogen for mathematician is the analogy?
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.220]   - This actually raises an interesting question
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.340]   I wasn't planning on asking you, but it just occurred to me.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.260]   Is it surprising how new a lot of mathematics is?
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.540]   Even mathematics that is taught at the high school level,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.620]   whereas with physics or biology, that's also new,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.140]   but you can tell a story where we didn't have the tools
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.340]   to look at the cell or to inspect an electron
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.060]   until very recently, but we've had mathematicians
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.500]   for two, 3,000 years who are doing pretty sophisticated
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   things, even the ancient Greeks.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.580]   It depends on what you mean by sophisticated,
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   but impressive things.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.180]   I don't know why linear algebra is so new given that fact.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.220]   - I wouldn't have thought of math
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.460]   as being like new in that way.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.220]   If anything, especially if we're talking
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.380]   at the high school level, I remember there's always
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.540]   the sensation that it's frustrating that all of the things
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.580]   are actually way more than a hundred years old
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.340]   in terms of the names attached to the theorems
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.740]   that you're doing, like none of them are remotely modern.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.820]   Whereas in biology, the understanding we have
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.940]   for how proteins are formed is relatively much more modern,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.140]   and you might be just a couple of generations away.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.820]   To some extent, there's a raw manpower component to it
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.100]   where like, how many people did pure math
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.340]   for most of history?
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.420]   For most of history, no one.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.660]   No one was a pure mathematician.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.740]   They were like a mathematician plus something else,
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:51.300]   or they were a physicist who were a natural philosopher,
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.060]   and insofar as you're doing natural philosophy,
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.300]   one component of that is developing math,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.060]   but it's not the full extent of what you do.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.180]   Even the ones who we think of as like very, very
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.860]   pure mathematicians in the sense that a lot
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.140]   of their most famous results are pure math, like Gauss.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.940]   Actually, a lot of the work, a lot of his output
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.780]   was also centered on very practical problems,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.340]   and maybe like since then, that's when you start
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.780]   to get an era of something more like pure mathematicians,
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.020]   and the raw number available that you have,
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.340]   the man hours that are being put into developing new theorems
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.300]   is probably just got this huge spike
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.700]   as one, the population grows,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.740]   and then also the percentage of the population
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.580]   that has the economic freedom to do something
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.740]   as indulgent as academia like grows.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.620]   Maybe it's pretty reasonable that most of it
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.100]   is much, much more recent.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.460]   That would be my guess.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.900]   - But I mean, some of these things seem
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.140]   actually pretty modern.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.340]   Like information theory is less than 100 years old.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.180]   - That's true.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.180]   - And it's pretty fundamental.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.100]   Like theoretically, you could have written that paper
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:54.940]   a long time ago.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.820]   - That's a really good example.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.740]   And maybe like this is a sign that the math that's developed
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.340]   is more in the service of the world that you live in
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.420]   and the adjacent problems that it's used to solve
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.860]   than we typically think of it.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.140]   On the one hand, information theory, such a good example,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.660]   'cause it's so pure that you could have asked the question,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.460]   you could have defined the notion of a bit,
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.780]   but evidently there wasn't a strong enough need
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.020]   to think in that way.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.540]   Whereas when you're doing error correction
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.180]   or you're thinking about actual information channels
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.580]   over a wire and you're at Bell Labs,
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   that's what prompts it.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.140]   Another maybe really good example for that
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.340]   would be chaos theory.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.460]   You could easily ask, why is chaos theory so recent?
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.420]   You could have written the Lorenz equations
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.820]   since differential equations existed.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.820]   Why didn't anyone do that and understand
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.380]   that there was this sort of sensitivity
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.580]   to initial conditions?
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.500]   And in that case, it would maybe be the opposite
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.420]   where it's not that you need the existence of computers
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.660]   as a problem to solve or the problems that they introduce
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.940]   are the problems to solve.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.140]   But instead, you need them to even discover the phenomenon
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:56.980]   in the first place.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.500]   Like a lot of original concepts in chaos theory
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   came from basically running simulations
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.620]   or doing things that required a massive amount of computation
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.540]   that simply wouldn't be done by hand.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.580]   Someone could ask the question,
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.900]   but they wouldn't have observed the unexpected phenomenon.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.180]   And there, even if it's questions that are as relevant
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.460]   to a pre-computer world as to a post-computer world,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.820]   like the nature of weather modeling
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.300]   or just the nature of three-body problem,
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.620]   like all of that kind of stuff,
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.020]   somehow, without the right tools for thought,
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.100]   it just didn't come into the mind.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.900]   And so maybe, yeah, maybe there's other things like that
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   where those questions or pieces of technology
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.620]   that start to fundamentally shape everyone's life
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.420]   will then invariably also shift the mathematician's focus.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.860]   - This actually reminds me,
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.660]   the first day of Scott Aronson's quantum information class,
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.660]   he said that what I'm about to describe to you
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.860]   could have been discovered by a mathematician
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.980]   before quantum physics existed,
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.980]   if only they'd asked the question,
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.500]   we're gonna do probabilities,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.700]   but we're only allowed to use unitaries.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.780]   And the rest of it is,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.180]   you could have just discovered quantum mechanics
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.420]   or quantum information from there.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.860]   - I mean, the thing about math, right,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.140]   especially if you're talking about pure axiomatized math,
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.500]   the experience as a student, as an undergrad,
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.340]   is that you are going through a textbook
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.260]   and it starts with saying,
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.940]   "Here's the axioms of this field."
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.580]   And then we're gonna deduce from those axioms,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.220]   like various different lemmas and theorems
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.020]   and proceed from that.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.020]   And with that as the framing,
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.700]   you get the impression that
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.420]   you could have just come up with any axioms,
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.100]   just make up some pile of axioms,
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.420]   deduce what follows from them.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.140]   And the space of possible like math is unfathomably huge.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.460]   And so you need some process that calls down
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.140]   what are the useful things to maybe pursue.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.220]   And so one of the things that I think is all too often
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.980]   missing in those pure math textbooks
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.100]   is basically the motivating problem.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.940]   Why is it that this was the set of axioms
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.780]   people found to be useful and not something else?
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.820]   The framework for quantum information theory,
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.340]   it's like you marry together linear algebra
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.300]   and probability, that's great,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.460]   but there's all sorts of other things
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.620]   where you could kind of try to cram them together
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.540]   and maybe get some sort of math out.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.540]   And the question becomes, is it worth your time to do that?
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.180]   Knot theory is something that emerged because,
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.940]   I think it was Lord Kelvin had a theory that
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.340]   all of the like elements on the periodic table
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.180]   had structures which were related to a knot,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.500]   like a knot being if you have a closed loop in 3D space,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.860]   but maybe if you want to continuously deform it
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.700]   without it ever crossing itself,
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.740]   you ask the question like,
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.060]   could you get back to say an open loop?
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.700]   Or if you can't get back to an open loop,
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.740]   what are the set of all other loops in 3D space
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.860]   that could be deformed into that?
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.940]   And you end up categorizing
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.780]   what all the different knots are.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.020]   And this was started with a completely incorrect theory
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.420]   for what's going on at the atomic level
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.420]   that gives atoms this very stable structure.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.060]   'Cause I think he found with smoke rings,
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.060]   like if you're somehow very dexterous
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.340]   with how you create these smoke rings,
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.300]   you can get them to form knots in 3D
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.220]   and they're very stable, it's like weirdly stable
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.620]   in that it'll never cross over itself.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   And so it has all those properties.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.220]   Now, that was irrelevant
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.460]   for understanding the periodic table,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.980]   but it was an interesting mathematical question
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.620]   and people kind of ran with it.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.100]   And in that case, it was an arbitrary reason
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.380]   that someone thought to ask the question
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.860]   and then some people ran with it.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.020]   And frankly, it's probably fewer people who run with it
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.540]   than would if it turned out to be a more useful question.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.580]   So really you want to ask like,
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.980]   what are the things that prompt people
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.380]   to ask what turns out to be a mathematical question
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.420]   given that the space
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.060]   of what would be mathematical questions
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.620]   is so unfathomably huge
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.820]   that it's just impossible to explore it
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.900]   through a random walk.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.740]   - Wait, are you saying
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.020]   that Lord Kelvin's apple hitting Newton story
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.900]   was that he was smoking a lot of pipe
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.540]   and needed to categorize his puffs?
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.900]   - Yeah, I can't remember
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.340]   if it was smoke rings out of his mouth.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.940]   I mean, that's a natural place.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.780]   We should look into that, I should have, yeah.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.940]   - Okay, so you've changed how,
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.100]   you and other creators have changed
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.180]   how pedagogy happens via animated videos.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.220]   What would it take to do something similar
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.660]   for video games, text, all these other mediums?
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.460]   Why hasn't there been a similar sort of
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.300]   broad scale adoption and transformation
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.100]   of how teaching happens there?
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   - I'm not sure I understand the question.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.340]   You're saying where there's been a rise
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.420]   of explanatory videos,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.060]   why is there not a similar rise
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.180]   in like pedagogical video games?
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   - Yeah.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.140]   - And well, one thing to understand,
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.380]   I guess games are very hard to make.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.980]   It takes a lot of resources for a given game.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.140]   And whenever people seem to try to do it
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.940]   with pedagogy as a motive,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.220]   like they're making some game
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.860]   whose goal is to teach something.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.940]   I don't play enough games,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.060]   so I can't really speak to it
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.500]   the way that well-versed game designers can.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.060]   It seems to be the case that they are not fun
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.260]   in the way that people would want them to be fun.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.700]   And then the ones that are actually most effective
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.100]   are not as directly educational.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.820]   - So there's clearly some of the one game
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.260]   that I actually have played
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.780]   because enough of my friends told me,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.020]   "Hey, you should really do this.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.540]   It seems relevant to math explanation."
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.460]   In the last like decade was The Witness.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.300]   Have you played it?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.380]   - I've heard about it.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.300]   - So as someone who doesn't play games
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.460]   and then did play it, it's fantastic.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.060]   It's absolutely well done in every possible way
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.500]   that you could want something to be well done.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.060]   And critical on that is the nature
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.300]   of how problems are solved.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.700]   The reason people were recommending it to me
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.420]   is because the feeling of playing The Witness
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.860]   is a lot like the feeling of doing math.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.420]   It's non-verbal.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.780]   You come across these little puzzles
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.500]   where the simple mechanics of one puzzle
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.140]   inform you about the fundamental mechanics
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.220]   that become relevant to much, much harder ones,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.300]   such that if you do it with the right sequence,
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.820]   you have the feeling of epiphany
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.380]   in ways that are like very self-satisfying.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.220]   And you come away feeling like,
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.020]   "Man, you should be able to do something like this for math."
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.140]   And maybe you can,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.020]   and it's just that it's so hard to make a game at all
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.980]   that there's just not the rate of production
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.620]   that you would need to explore,
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.900]   like get enough games out there that one of them hits.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.700]   'Cause with YouTube, there's a lot of math videos on YouTube.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.580]   It's okay that most of them suck, right?
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.820]   It's okay because, hey, you just need enough
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.740]   that when someone searches for the term that they want,
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.380]   they get one that is good and scratches that itch,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.940]   or that they might get recommended something
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.220]   that is bringing a question to their mind
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.260]   that they wouldn't have thought about,
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.500]   but they become really interested once it's there.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.340]   Whereas with video games, I don't know,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.220]   you're also spending a lot more time as a user on each one
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.340]   rather than a five-minute average experience.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.860]   It's like a many, many hour average experience.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.060]   You asked the question on text.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.860]   I don't know if I accept the premise
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.740]   that there's not the same advances and innovation
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   in the world of textual explanations.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.140]   Like Mathagon is a really, really good example of this.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.300]   That's like the textbook of the future.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.380]   It's a website.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.900]   It's basically an interactive textbook.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.260]   The explanations are really good.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.100]   And insofar as it doesn't have more of an impact
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:08.940]   or more of a reach,
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.820]   it's maybe just because people don't know about it
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.460]   or don't have an easy means of accessing
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.700]   something that recommends to them
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.500]   like the really good innovations happening
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.860]   in the world of textual explanations
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.780]   in the way that YouTube has this recommending engine
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.540]   that tries its hardest to get more of these things
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.180]   in front of people.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.700]   And I'm quite sure that in the world
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.420]   of actual like written textbooks,
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.220]   I mean, there's so many that I like so much
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.100]   that I think it would be a disservice to talk about
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.180]   that medium is not like making advances
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.940]   in terms of more and more thought put towards empathy
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.540]   to the learner and things like that.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.180]   - Should the top 0.1% of educators,
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.100]   should they be exclusively on the internet?
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.100]   Because it seems like a waste
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.780]   if you were just a college professor
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.780]   or a high school professor
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.300]   and you were teaching 50 kids a year or something.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.420]   Given the greater scale available,
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.780]   should more of them be trying to see
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.260]   if they can reach more people?
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.140]   - I think it's not a bad thing for more educators
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.980]   who are good at what they're doing
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.580]   to put their stuff online, for sure.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.300]   Highly encourage that even if it's as simple
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.540]   as getting someone to put a camera
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.980]   in the back of the classroom.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.540]   I don't think it would be a good idea
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.140]   to get those people out of the classroom.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.060]   If anything, I think one of the best things
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.460]   that I could do for my career
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.100]   would be to put myself into more classrooms.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.580]   And actually I'm quite determined at some point
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.540]   to like be a high school math teacher
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.740]   for some number of years.
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.340]   I don't know when there's such opportunity cost, I guess.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:35.020]   It's something I would plan on like notably later,
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.580]   as long as there's not other like life logistics
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.100]   that occupy a lot of mindshare
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.620]   because everything I know about high school teaching
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.300]   is like it just kicks your ass for the first two years.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.380]   But I would say one of the most valuable things
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.580]   that you can have if you're trying to explain stuff online
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.660]   is a sense of empathy
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.900]   for what the possible viewers are like that,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.940]   that are out there.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.620]   The more distance that you put between yourself and them
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.460]   in terms of life circumstances,
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.900]   I'm not a college student,
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.300]   so I don't have the same empathy
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.740]   with what a college student's like.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.940]   Certainly not a high school student,
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.460]   so I've lost that empathy.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.460]   That distance just makes it more and more
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.980]   of an uphill battle to make the content good for them.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.540]   And I think keeping people in regular touch
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.580]   with just what people in the classroom actively need
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.460]   is necessary for them to remain as good
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.700]   and as sharp as they are.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.540]   So yes, get more of those top 0.1%
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.620]   to put their stuff online.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.260]   But I would absolutely disagree with the idea
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.260]   of taking them out of their existing circumstances,
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.780]   maybe for a year or two so they don't lose that sharpness,
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.860]   but then put them right back in
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.020]   because one, it makes them better at the online position.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.820]   But also, the other thing I might disagree with
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.660]   is the idea that the reach is lower
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.540]   because, okay, yes, it's a smaller number of people,
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.620]   but you're with them for much, much more time,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.740]   and you actually have the chance
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.980]   of influencing their trajectory through a social connection
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.740]   in a way that you just don't over YouTube.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.300]   And I think you're using the word education
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.340]   in a way that I would maybe sub out
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.660]   for the word explanation.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.460]   Like, you want explanations to be online,
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.620]   but like, education, the word education
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.580]   derives from the same root as the word educe,
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.780]   like to bring out.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.220]   And I really like that as a bit of etymology
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.100]   because it reminds you that the job of an educator
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.460]   is not to like, take their knowledge
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.140]   and shove it into the heads of someone else.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.020]   The job is to bring it out.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.500]   That's very, very hard to do in a video.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.860]   And in fact, even if you can kind of get at it
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.260]   by asking intriguing questions, for the most part,
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.940]   the video is there to answer something
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.180]   once someone has a question.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.820]   And the teacher's job or the educator's job
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.140]   should be to provide the environment
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.660]   such that you're bringing out from your students
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.260]   as much as you can through inspiration,
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.580]   through projects, through little bits of mentorship
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.220]   and encouragement along the way
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.220]   that requires, you know, eye contact
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.060]   and being there in person
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.660]   and being a true figure in their life
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.620]   rather than just an abstract voice behind a screen.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.140]   - Then should we think of educators
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.980]   more as motivational speakers?
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.060]   As in the actual job of getting the content in your head
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.340]   is maybe for the textbooks or for the YouTube,
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.100]   but now the job, like why we have college classes
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.460]   or high school classes is we have somebody
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.940]   who approximates Tony Robbins to, you know,
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.220]   get you to do the thing.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.220]   - That would be a subset of it,
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.060]   but there's more than just motivational speech
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.300]   that goes into it, right?
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.980]   There's facilitation of projects
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.500]   or even coming up with what the projects are
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.900]   or recognizing what a student is interested in
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.020]   so that you can try to tailor a question
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.860]   to their specific set of interests,
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.380]   or you can maybe act as the curator where,
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.980]   hey, there's a lot of online explanations
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.500]   for what a croissant distribution is.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.940]   You know, like, okay, which of these is the right one
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   that I could serve?
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.100]   And based on knowing you as a particular student,
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.300]   what might resonate,
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.500]   you might be in a better position to do that.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.100]   All of that goes beyond being a Tony Robbins out,
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.140]   you know, saying like,
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:00.220]   oh, you be the best person that you can be and all of that.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.180]   And one thing I might say is that anytime
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.540]   that I'll chat with mathematicians
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.580]   and try to get a sense for how they got into it,
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.780]   what got them started.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.060]   So, so often it starts by saying,
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.860]   well, there was this one teacher
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.860]   and that teacher did something very small.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.540]   They like pulled them aside and just said,
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.380]   hey, you're really good at this.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.500]   Have you considered studying more?
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.340]   Or they give them an interesting problem.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.780]   And the thing that takes like at most 30 minutes
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.340]   of the teacher's time, maybe even 30 seconds,
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.380]   has these completely monumental rippling effects
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.060]   for the life of the student they were talking to
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.820]   that then sets them on this whole different trajectory.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.260]   Two examples of this come to mind actually.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.980]   One is this woman who was saying she had this moment,
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.740]   she got pulled aside from the teacher
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.380]   and he just said like, hey,
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.380]   I think you're really good at math.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.500]   You should consider being a math major,
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.860]   which had been completely outside
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.300]   of her like purview at that time.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.900]   And that like changed the way she thought about it.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.820]   And then later she said,
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.820]   she learned that he like did that for a large number of people
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.060]   and just pulled him and be like,
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.060]   hey, you're really good at math.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.180]   So that's a level of impact that you can have in person
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.860]   as a figure in their lives
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.060]   in a way that you can't over a screen.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.660]   Then another one, which was very funny,
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.060]   I was asking this guy why he went
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.500]   into the specific field that he did.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.700]   It was a seemingly arbitrary thing in my mind,
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.580]   but I guess all pure math seems to be.
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.980]   He said that he for his first year of grad school
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.300]   was sitting in this seminar.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.740]   And at the end of the seminar,
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.980]   the professor who was this old professor,
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.060]   he had never met him before.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.540]   They didn't have any kind of connection.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.620]   He seeks this guy out.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.300]   He comes up and he says, you, I have a problem for you,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.300]   a good research problem that I think might be
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.860]   a good place for you to start in the next couple of months.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.700]   And this guy was like, oh, okay.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.100]   And he like gets this research problem
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.100]   and he spends some months thinking about it
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.460]   and then he comes back.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.180]   And then it later came to light
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.500]   that the professor mistook him for someone else.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.340]   (laughing)
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.740]   Someone he was supposed to be mentoring.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.900]   And so he was just like the stereotypical image
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.620]   of like a doddering old math professor
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.660]   who's not very in tune with the people in his life.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.620]   That was the actual situation.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.460]   But nevertheless, that moment
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.620]   of accidentally giving someone a problem
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.180]   completely shifted the research path for him,
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.860]   which if nothing else shows you the sensitivity
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.940]   to initial conditions that takes place
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.940]   when you are a student and how the educator
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.900]   is right on that nexus of sensitivity
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.060]   who can completely swing the fences one way or another
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.860]   for what you do.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.260]   And for every one of those stories,
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.540]   there's gonna be an unfortunate counterbalancing story
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.820]   about people who are demotivated from math.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.980]   I mean, I think this was seventh grade.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.140]   There was this math class that I was in
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.340]   and I was one of the people who was like good at math
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.700]   and enjoyed it and would often like help the people
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.980]   in the class understand it and all that.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.260]   And so I had enough ego built up, I guess,
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.700]   to have like a strong shell around things.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.180]   And I guess for context, I also really liked music
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.140]   and there was this like concert that had happened
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.820]   where I had like a certain solo or something
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.940]   earlier in the day or earlier in that week.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.580]   And there was a substitute teacher on one day.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.500]   So she didn't have like any of the context
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.260]   and she gave some lesson
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.660]   and then had us spend the second half of the class
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.380]   going over the homework for it.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.540]   All of the other students in the class were very confused.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.300]   And I think I remember like they would kind of come to me
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.100]   and I would try to offer to help them.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.580]   And the substitute was going around the class
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.620]   in these circles and basically marking off a little star
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.900]   for how far down the homework people were
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.300]   just to get a sense, are they progressing?
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.020]   And that was kind of her way of measuring.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.420]   Are they very far?
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.580]   And when she got to me, I had done like none of them
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.100]   'cause I was spending my whole time
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.620]   trying to help all of the others.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.980]   And she like, after having written a little star
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.540]   next to the same problem, like three different times,
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.220]   she said to me like, you know,
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.860]   sometimes music people just aren't math people.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.460]   And it keeps walking on.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.060]   So now I was in the best possible circumstance
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.220]   to not let that hit hard because like one,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.020]   I had the moral high ground of like,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.460]   hey, I've just been helping all these people.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.140]   Like I understand it and I've been doing your job for you.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.100]   This was my like little egotistical seventh grade brain.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.300]   I knew that I knew the stuff and things like that.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.500]   Even still, even with all of that
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.340]   as like the armor that was put up,
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.140]   I remember it was just this like shock to my system.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.340]   You know, she says this thing and it just made me like
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.580]   strangely teary eyed or something.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.380]   And I can only imagine if you're in a position
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.220]   where you're not confident in math
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.580]   and the thing that you know deep in your heart
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.780]   is actually you are kind of struggling with it.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.900]   Just a little throwaway comment like that
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.660]   could completely derail the whole system
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.940]   in terms of your relationship with the subject.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.460]   So it's another example to illustrate the sensitivity
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:38.980]   to initial conditions, right?
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.780]   Where there, you know, I was in a robust position.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.900]   It wasn't as sensitive.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.620]   I was gonna love math no matter what,
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.260]   but you envision someone who's a little bit more
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.140]   on that teetering edge and the comment one way or another,
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.500]   either saying you're good at this,
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.860]   you should consider majoring in it
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.140]   or saying sometimes music people aren't math people,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.660]   which isn't even true or you know what I mean?
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.940]   Like that's the other thing about it
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.180]   that like niggled at my brain when she said it.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.620]   Yeah, all of that is just so important
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.340]   for people's development that when people talk
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.380]   about online education as being valuable
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.660]   or revolutionary or anything like that,
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.300]   there's a part of me that sort of rolls my eyes
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.740]   because it just doesn't get at the truth
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.460]   that online explanations have nothing to do
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.900]   with all of that important stuff that's actually happening.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.020]   And at best, it should be like in the service
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.660]   of helping that side of things
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.860]   that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.700]   - I had Tyler Cowen on the podcast
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.820]   and he obviously has Marginal Revolution University,
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.100]   these YouTube videos where he explains economics.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.460]   And he had a similar answer to give.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.020]   I think I asked him basically,
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.500]   why aren't you just replacing
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.820]   or should we think of you as a substitute
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.500]   for all these economics teachers?
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.460]   And in his mind as well,
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.140]   he was more a compliment to the functions
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.460]   that happen in the class.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.940]   And to your point about the initial conditions,
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.740]   I'm sure you remember the details of the story,
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.580]   but I just vaguely remember hearing this.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.620]   Wasn't there a case where a mathematician
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.300]   who later ended up becoming famous,
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.260]   he arrives to a lecture late,
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.220]   see, do you wanna tell the story?
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.140]   - I don't remember it beat for beat,
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.620]   but I think it was a statistics class
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.660]   and he was a grad student and he comes in, it's late,
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.180]   and there's two problems on the board
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.460]   that the professor had written.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.540]   He assumed that those two problems were homework.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.460]   And so he goes home and he works on them.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.820]   And after a couple of weeks,
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.260]   he goes to the professor's office
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.340]   and turns in his homework and he's like,
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.340]   I'm sorry, I'm so late.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.180]   This one, it just took me a lot longer than some of the others
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:30.980]   and the professor's like, oh, okay.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.740]   And just like shuffles it away.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.980]   And then a couple of days later,
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.660]   when the prof had had the time to like go through
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:36.500]   and see them,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.220]   he realized that the student
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:39.700]   had fully answered these questions.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.220]   What the student didn't know
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.060]   is that they were not homework problems
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.180]   written on the chalkboard.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.380]   They were two unsolved problems in the field
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.140]   that the prof had put up as examples
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.380]   of what the field was striving for.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.940]   I don't remember what problems they were.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.860]   So that would be more fun color to add to the story.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.380]   But then at least as the anecdote told to me,
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.980]   however many years ago goes,
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.780]   the prof then like finds the student's housing
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:03.620]   and like knocks on the door.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:04.580]   He's like, do you realize
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.500]   that like these were actually unsolved problems?
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.900]   And then he gets to basically make those his thesis.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.580]   So that, yeah,
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.540]   that idea of just being given something
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.180]   for completely random reasons
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.500]   and it shifts the course of what you do.
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.340]   - Right, right, right.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.620]   Or just, you know,
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.060]   it's a thing where if you know a crossword is solvable,
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.860]   you just like, you just keep going at it until you solve it.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.020]   - Or the four minute mile, right?
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.860]   - Right, exactly.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.540]   That's a great example.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.460]   Another valuable experience,
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:36.460]   at least one I had was taking Aaronson's classes in college
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.860]   and realizing I am like
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.340]   at least two standard deviations below him.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.820]   And that was actually a really valuable experience for me,
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.900]   not because it increased my confidence in,
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.700]   I didn't have a moment where I was like,
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.620]   oh wow, I'm good at this.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.300]   But it was useful to know, you know,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.900]   but podcasting is an easier thing to do, right?
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.300]   So then it's good to know
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.420]   that there's actual technical things out there
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.460]   where knowing that you can get really deep into something
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.260]   and people are just gonna be like way above you,
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.060]   having that sort of awareness.
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:10.300]   - Do you think it's fair to have a mental model
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:14.300]   that has a static G factor type quality here
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.180]   such that you're two standard deviations below
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.620]   and that is forever the state of things?
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.140]   Or do you think that the right mental model
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.740]   is something that allows for flexibility
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.780]   on where contributions actually come from
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.980]   or where intuitions come from that, you know,
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.060]   through many years of experience
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.300]   in certain kinds of problem solving,
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.420]   maybe what seemed like a flash of insight
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.020]   was actually like the residue of just years
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.660]   of thinking about certain kinds of puzzles
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.140]   that he had that you maybe didn't.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.820]   - Yeah, can I tell you a story from that class actually?
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.660]   - Yeah, yeah, go for it.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.860]   - So he's giving some proof about like how one,
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.700]   actually it wasn't that.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.340]   He was giving a proof of that,
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.260]   I forgot the name of the method,
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.500]   but it's a very important method in complexity theory
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:56.460]   that helped to prove the bounds of the complexity
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.940]   of different problems.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.140]   And he explains it and he says,
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:05.140]   you know, in 1999, I approved this myself,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.860]   but I realized that six months before
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.860]   somebody had already published a paper with this method.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.660]   And I realized I'm catching up to the frontier now,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.380]   you know, but when I was a kid, I was like doing Euler,
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.500]   that's like 2000 years in regress,
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.820]   now I'm six months behind.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:22.060]   And then so later on in the day, I'm like, wait, 1999,
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.940]   how old was Scott Aronson in 1999?
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.980]   And I think it was 18 or 19.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.540]   And he was basically proving frontier results
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.780]   in complexity theory that were,
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.540]   so at that point you're like, all right,
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.860]   Aronson's a special animal here.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.180]   - You are right, he's probably a special animal.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.180]   - But it's just broadly good to know,
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.180]   just like have that sort of upper constraint
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.300]   on your Dunning-Kruger that you can,
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.940]   this exists in the world.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.180]   - Maybe the thing that I would want to say is that
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.340]   whatever the scale is on which he's,
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.020]   two standard deviations above you,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.100]   that might not be the one scale that matters.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.940]   And that like contributions to these fields
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.940]   don't always look like genius insights.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:07.180]   And that sometimes there's root to be born from say,
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.300]   becoming kind of an expert in two different things
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.140]   and then finding connections between them.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.940]   And like the people who make contributions
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.100]   are not necessarily the Scott Aronsons of the world.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:21.220]   Still, you are probably a truth that there are,
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.620]   it's like von Neumann's another example
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.460]   of one of these, right?
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:25.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:28.580]   - Okay, how much does Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.900]   practically matter?
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.660]   Is it something that comes up a lot
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.220]   or is it just a interesting thing to know about the bounds
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.420]   that isn't day-to-day applicable?
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.500]   - You've asked me another question
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.740]   where I'm not the best one to ask
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.780]   and I should throw that as a caveat to begin.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:46.260]   From what I understand, it really doesn't come up.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.660]   I mean, the analogy to make,
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.660]   the paradoxical fact that it's conveying,
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.140]   the idea that you can't have an axiom system
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.500]   that is both, that will basically like
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.060]   prove all of the things that are true
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.020]   and which is also self-consistent.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.260]   The contradiction that you construct out of that
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.380]   has the same feeling as the sentence,
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.980]   this statement is a lie.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.340]   Well, you know, you think about the statement,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.620]   if it's false, then it must be true.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.060]   If it's true, it must be false.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.460]   It's that same flavor.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.580]   And you might ask, does the existence of that paradox
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:18.740]   mean that it's hard to speak English unequivocally?
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.580]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.540]   - It's so rare that you would come up with something
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.100]   that happens to have a bit of self-reference in it
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.140]   there were one of the first times
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.740]   that there was something that came up
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.860]   that didn't feel quite as pathological in that way.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.220]   If the curious listener wants to go into it,
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.500]   that search term would be Paris-Harrington theorems,
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.900]   where it's a little pathological,
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.100]   but it wasn't the really a question that came up
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.860]   that didn't seem like it was deliberately constructed
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.140]   to be one of these self-referential things
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.620]   where it shows itself to be outside the bounds
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.780]   of whatever axiom system you were starting with.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:56.300]   And so it was shown to be unresolvable in a certain sense,
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.060]   but it was asking a, I don't wanna say natural
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.260]   because a lot of these math questions aren't natural
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.460]   in the sense that most people would want,
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.300]   but it was asking a question
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.860]   where you wouldn't expect that to be true.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.280]   So maybe at the edges of theory,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.580]   there are some times when the paradoxes that are possible,
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.020]   if the Godel's impossibility theorem shows,
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.780]   like do eke their ways in.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.220]   The impression I get is no mathematician
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.060]   is thinking about it.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.180]   They're not actively worrying about it.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.180]   It's not like, oh God, no.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.500]   Like, can I be sure that the stuff
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.400]   that I'm gonna show is true?
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.860]   For all the practical problems,
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.620]   if it's like the Riemann hypothesis or twin primes,
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.940]   almost everyone's like, no, there's gonna be an answer.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.140]   Like maybe they turn out to be unresolvable
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.200]   in one of these ways.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.940]   But like, there's just a strong sense
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:41.060]   that that theorem came from a pathology
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.500]   in a way that natural questions
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.740]   that people actually care about don't.
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.820]   - That's really interesting that something
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.380]   from the outside and in popularizations
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.700]   seems to be a very fundamental thing
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.120]   where people have definitely heard about this, right?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.620]   It's not internally.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.060]   A good analogy here is in computer science,
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:00.900]   the halting problem.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.220]   It's like you take a computer science course,
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.180]   one of the first things you learn
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.820]   is the proof of the halting problem.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.340]   And it's another one of those things
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.100]   where you don't really need to be able to prove
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.800]   that every single, or have that sort of program available.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   - Yeah.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.560]   No comment.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.380]   - No more comment.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:25.520]   - Why are good explanations so hard to find
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.920]   despite how useful they are?
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.680]   Obviously there's many other, other than you as well,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.360]   there's many other cases of good explanations,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.760]   but generally it just seems like
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.640]   there aren't as many as there should be.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.840]   Is it just a story of economics
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.320]   where it's nobody's incentive to be making
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.400]   really spend a lot of time making good explanations?
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.360]   Is it just a really hard skill that isn't correlated
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.520]   with being able to come up with the discovery itself?
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.600]   Why are good explanations scarce?
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.820]   - I think there's maybe two explanations.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.400]   The first less important one is gonna be that
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.200]   there's a difference between knowing something
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.640]   and then remembering what it's like not to know it.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.680]   And the characteristic of a good explanation
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.760]   is that you're walking someone on a path
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.560]   from the feeling of not understanding
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.480]   up to the feeling of understanding.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.200]   Earlier, you were asking about societies
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.460]   that lack numeracy.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.160]   That's such a hard brain state to put yourself in,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.840]   like what's it like to not even know numbers?
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.880]   How would you start to explain what numbers are?
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.200]   Maybe you should go from a bunch of concrete examples,
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.400]   but like the way that you think about numbers
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.720]   and adding things, it's just,
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.680]   you have to really unpack a lot before you even start there.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.520]   And I think at higher levels of abstraction,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.880]   that becomes even harder
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.160]   'cause it shapes the way that you think so much
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.840]   that remembering what it's like not to understand it.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.640]   You're teaching some kid algebra
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.680]   and the premise of like a variable,
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.080]   they're like, what is X?
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.500]   And you're like, well, it's not necessarily anything,
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.340]   but it's what we're solving for.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.660]   They're like, yeah, but what is it?
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.380]   Like trying to answer what is X is a weirdly hard thing
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.340]   'cause it is the premise that you're even starting from.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:55.320]   The more important one probably is that
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.500]   the best explanation depends heavily
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.780]   on the individual who's learning.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.940]   And the perfect explanation for you
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.420]   often might be very different
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.420]   from the perfect explanation for someone else.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:10.260]   So there's a lot of very good domain specific explanations,
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.240]   you know, pull up in any textbook
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.480]   and like chapter 12 of it
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.540]   is probably explaining the content in there like quite well,
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.100]   assuming that you've read chapters one through 11.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.700]   But if you're coming in from a cold start,
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.980]   it's a little bit hard.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.100]   And so the real gold nugget is like,
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.740]   how do you construct explanations
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.440]   which are as generally useful as possible,
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.540]   as generally appealing as possible?
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.640]   And that I think because you can't assume shared context,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.740]   it becomes this challenge.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.040]   And I think there's like tips and tricks along the way,
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.320]   but because the people that are often making explanations
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.700]   have a specific enough audience,
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.900]   it is this classroom of 30 people,
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.260]   or it's this discipline of majors
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.020]   who are in their third year.
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.100]   All the explanations from the people
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.260]   who are professional explainers in some sense
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.100]   are so targeted that
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.660]   maybe it's the economic thing you're talking about.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.720]   There's not, or at least until recently in history,
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.020]   there hasn't been the need to,
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.620]   or the incentive to come up with something
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.460]   that would be motivating and approachable and clear
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.420]   to an extremely wide variety of different backgrounds.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:16.260]   - Is the process of making your videos, is that mostly you?
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:19.300]   Okay, given the scale you're reaching,
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.580]   it seems that if it was possible,
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.660]   just like a small increase in productivity
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.100]   would be worth like an entire production studio.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.300]   And it's interesting to me or surprising
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.820]   that the transaction cost of having a production setup
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.460]   are high enough that it's better to literally do
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.540]   the mundane details yourself.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.000]   - Yeah, I mean, this could honestly just be a personal flaw.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.640]   Like I'm not good at pulling people in
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.620]   and I've struggled to do this effectively in the past.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.120]   But a part of it is that the seemingly mundane details
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.020]   are sometimes just how I even think
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.060]   about constructing it in the first place.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.140]   You know, the first thing that a lot of YouTubers will do
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.300]   if they can hire is hire an editor.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.480]   And this will be because they film a lot of things.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.780]   And so a lot of the editing process is removing the stuff
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.820]   that was filmed that shouldn't be in the video
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.900]   and just leaving the stuff that should be in the video.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.180]   And that's time consuming and it's kind of mundane.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.580]   And it's probably not that relevant
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.440]   to what the creator should be thinking about.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.020]   When you're not filming stuff,
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.140]   like the editing process for me, you know,
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.880]   I start by laying out all of the animations
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.500]   and stuff that I'll want in a timeline.
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.580]   And then once I record the voiceover,
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.500]   the actual editing is like a day.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.860]   And it's not like, I guess I could hire someone
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.060]   and gain a day back of my life.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.700]   But the communication back and forth
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.060]   for saying what specifically I want,
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.080]   like all of the little cuts that I'm making along the way
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.940]   are my way of even thinking about
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.740]   what I want the final piece to be,
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.080]   such that it would be hard to put it into words.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.220]   It's similar for why I maybe find it quite hard
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:52.220]   to use like Copilot and some of these like LLM tools
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.640]   and coding where for the animation code,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.560]   you know, it can be super great
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.700]   if you're learning some new library
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.180]   and it knows about that library that you don't.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.140]   But for my library that I know inside it out,
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.780]   if I'm just using it, it feels like,
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.660]   oh, this should be the most automatable thing ever.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.660]   You know, it's just text.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.100]   Like I should be the first YouTuber
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.180]   who can actually do this better
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.980]   'cause the substance behind each animation is text.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.060]   It's not like an editing workflow in quite the same way.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.540]   But it doesn't work.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.960]   And I think it's because,
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.900]   maybe it's just because you need a multimodal thing
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.000]   that actually understands the look of the output.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.220]   Like the output isn't something that is consumable in text.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.600]   It's something about how it looks.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.780]   But at a deeper level, I can't even put into words
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.600]   what I want to put on the screen except to do so in code.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.020]   Like that's just the way that I'm thinking about it.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.340]   And like if I were to try to put into English
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.660]   the thing that I want as a comment that then gets expanded,
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:47.140]   that task is actually harder than writing it in the code.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.420]   And if it's clunky to write in code,
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   that's a sign that I should like change the interface
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.180]   of the library such that it's less clunky
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.660]   to be expressive in the way that I want.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.520]   And it's in that same way where a lot of the creative
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.760]   process that feels mundane,
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.420]   those are just like the cogs of thought slowly turning
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.520]   in a way that if they weren't turning for that part,
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.680]   they would have to be turning during the interface
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.600]   of communication with a collaborator.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.080]   - Yeah, on the point of working with Copilot,
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.840]   where we kind of visualize the changes you wanted to make.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.360]   The paper from Microsoft Research,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.400]   the Sparks of AGI paper,
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.400]   had an actually really interesting example
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.740]   where it was generating LaTeX
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.140]   and they generated some output and they say,
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.660]   "Change this so that the visual that comes up
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.900]   "in the rendering is different in this way."
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.340]   And it was actually able to do that,
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.060]   which was their evidence that it can understand
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.100]   the higher level visual abstraction.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.140]   So, but I guess I can't do that for Manim.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.580]   - There's a couple of reasons it might not be
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.820]   as fair a comparison.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.180]   One would be the two versions of Manim.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.340]   There was a split where there's a community version
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.680]   that is by the community for the community.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.820]   And then mine, the interfaces are largely similar.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.620]   The rendering engines are quite different.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.300]   But because of slight differences in that,
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.180]   and it might have a tendency,
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.920]   it learned from one or it saw examples from one
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.200]   and it's intermixing them.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.460]   So stuff just doesn't quite run when there's discrepancy.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.620]   I maybe shot myself in the foot
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.460]   where all of my code for videos,
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.060]   like I don't really comment it that much
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.140]   because it's like a one and done deal.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.700]   If it's, there's also code for the core library,
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.420]   I could comment and document a lot better.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.200]   But like the way that I'm making it feels much more
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   like the editing flow.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.880]   If you were to look at the operation history
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.600]   of someone in After Effects, right?
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.560]   Like written down, it's a little bit more like that
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.500]   where there's not a perfect description in English
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.560]   of the thing that I want to do.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.120]   And then the execution of that,
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.760]   it's just the execution of that.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.120]   And it's not meant to be editable and hindsight as much
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.880]   because I'm just in the flow of making the scene
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.160]   for the one video.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.900]   And maybe I could have given it a better chance
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.980]   to learn what is supposed to be happening
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.660]   by having a really well-documented set of like,
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.140]   this is the input, this is the output,
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.500]   this is the comment describing it in English.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.060]   But even then that wouldn't hit the problem
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.980]   on like I would have to articulate
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.340]   what the thing I want is in the first place.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.460]   And the language, the program language
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.340]   is just the right mode of articulation in the first place.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.420]   - This is something I wanted to,
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.060]   I was really curious about ever since I learned about it.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.440]   I watched many of the summer
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.200]   of math exploration prize videos,
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.360]   and it was shocking to me how good,
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.780]   I mean, these look like entire production studios
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.400]   were dedicated to making them, many of them.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.040]   And it was shocking to me that you could motivate
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.360]   and elicit this quality of contribution
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.760]   given the relatively modest prize pool,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.320]   which I was like five winners, $1,000 each.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.080]   What is your explanation of just running prizes like this,
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.360]   why you were able to get such high quality contributions?
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   Is the prize pool even relevant?
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.740]   Is it just about your reputation and reach?
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.720]   - I do wonder how relevant the prize pool is.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.400]   I mean, we've been thinking about this
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.280]   'cause we did it first in 2021,
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.160]   then we plan to continue doing it annually.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.040]   And I probably, if I was a mover and a shaker,
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.680]   could raise much more
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.840]   if I wanted to get a big prize pool there.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.280]   I don't think it would change the quality of the content
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.220]   'cause the impression I get
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.160]   is that people aren't fundamentally motivated
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.360]   by winning some cash prize.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.240]   Certainly, they're not investing
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.160]   with an expected value calculation.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.160]   If they are, that's a terrible, terrible plan.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.720]   And if anything, that might be a problem.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.360]   Let's say it was a $100,000 prize for each of the winners.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.140]   Then it would be a real problem where someone who,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.080]   and people do delusionally think
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.480]   that they're very likely gonna be the winner.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.880]   They might actually pour a lot of their own resources into it
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.840]   with the expectation of gaining it.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.800]   And then that's just a messy situation I don't wanna be in.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.920]   We're like, "Why wasn't mine chosen as a winner?"
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.160]   Because the whole event is not supposed to be about winners.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.700]   In fact, maybe for listeners who don't know,
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.980]   I should describe what you're talking about,
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.640]   the Summer of Math exposition.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.200]   Actually, the history is a little bit funny
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.480]   'cause it started with an intern application
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.600]   where I, in 2021, wanted to have just like a couple interns
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.320]   to do a certain thing on my website, basically.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   And I put out a call for people to apply.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.640]   I got 2,500 applicants.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.760]   And somewhere in the application,
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.100]   I mentioned that during the summer,
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.120]   in addition to the main task I wanted them to do,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.400]   I'd give freedom if they just wanted to do
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.600]   something relevant to math exposition online
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.840]   that was their own thing,
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.280]   I'd be happy to provide some mentorship
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.680]   or just give them the freedom to do that one day a week
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.760]   and give me a little pitch on what your idea would be.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.120]   And as I went through all of the applications,
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.080]   which is a lot, I felt so bad
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.040]   'cause so often the person would have a little pitch
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.400]   on what they would wanna make.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.560]   And in my mind, I'd think, cool, you should make that.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.440]   You don't need me to do that.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.120]   Just spend your summer making that, why not?
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.560]   And people were clearly inspired
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.860]   by the thought of adding something.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.760]   And like I said earlier, being a YouTuber
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.880]   is the most common job aspiration
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.160]   among the youth these days.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.080]   And so as a consolation of sorts
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.000]   to those 99% that I had to reject for the internship,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.220]   I said, oh, but what we will do,
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.240]   we're just gonna like host this thing,
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.260]   we'll call it the Summer of Math Exposition,
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.780]   where we'll give you a deadline.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.220]   I'll like promise to feature some people in a video,
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.120]   maybe I'll choose five of them to do that.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.800]   And if you feel like the thing that you were gonna do,
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.080]   like with me as your 20% project as an intern
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.600]   is something you're excited about,
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.800]   make it 100% project or 20% or whatever freedom you have,
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.000]   just do it anyway.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.160]   And like, I can give you this little carrot
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.120]   in the form of featuring it in a video
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.520]   and give you a deadline, which let's be honest,
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.760]   is what actually makes the difference
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.000]   between people doing something
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.320]   and procrastinating on it sometimes.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.720]   Later, there was, I think it was Brilliant that year,
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.040]   said they would be happy to put some cash prizes in.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.680]   So I said, sure, why not?
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.920]   I don't think the cash prize is super important,
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.160]   but it's nice.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.040]   I mean, it shows that someone actually cared
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.200]   and put some real thought into doing something
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.120]   that wasn't just a made up gold star,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.200]   but they put some material behind saying
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.040]   that you were selected as a winner of this thing.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.520]   But all in all, it was never supposed to be
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.580]   about choosing winners.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.860]   It was just get more people to make stuff.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.880]   And if anything, I'd actually,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.600]   I love it when I see stuff from existing educators
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.080]   and teachers, where it's maybe not the youth
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.440]   who want to be YouTubers pouring their hearts
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.480]   and souls into it, but it's the educator
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.160]   who built up a lot of intuition
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.200]   over the course of their career
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.360]   for what constitutes a clear explanation,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.560]   and they're just sharing it more broadly.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.800]   So to your question on what is it
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.760]   that caused there to be such high production quality
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.920]   in some of the entries there,
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.600]   part of the answer might just be that tooling is so good now
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.040]   that individuals can actually make
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.120]   pretty incredible things sometimes.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   - I misphrased if I said production quality.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.000]   I just meant the whole composition as a whole.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.720]   - Yeah, well, there's a selection filter too, right?
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.040]   Like there were, in that first year, 1,200 submissions
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040]   I featured in the winning video, five of them.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.040]   So of course, they're necessarily unrepresentative
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.000]   of the norm by the very nature
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.480]   of who I was choosing to feature.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.840]   - But the fact that those were even in the pool,
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.120]   something that high quality was even in the pool.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.040]   - I think it hits a little bit to your miracle year point,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.000]   where I think what might be happening
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.540]   is you have people with a ton of potential energy
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.280]   for something that they'd kind of been thinking
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.200]   about making for a long time.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.360]   And the hope was to give people a little push.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.400]   Here's a deadline, here's a little prize,
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.160]   here's a promise that maybe if you make it,
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.640]   it won't just go into the void,
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.360]   but there's a chance that it gets exposed to more people,
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.480]   which I think has absolutely played out.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.800]   And not for the reason that someone might expect
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.640]   where I choose winners and I feature those winners
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.200]   and people watch them.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.440]   A huge amount of viewership happens
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.760]   before I even begin the process of looking at them.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.480]   And this was an accident too,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.880]   where in this first year, we got 1200 submissions.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.920]   I said, expect judges who are reviewing it
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.560]   to spend at most 10 minutes on each piece.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.480]   So it could be longer,
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.720]   but don't rely on someone watching it for more.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.320]   But realistically, when I'm reviewing something,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.840]   I wanna watch the whole piece.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.320]   I absolutely do not have time to watch that many.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.600]   (laughing)
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.680]   I've learned it takes me about two weeks
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.600]   of just full-time work to watch 100 of these pieces
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.400]   and give the kind of feedback that I want.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.840]   And to manage that problem
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.760]   of more than we could manually review,
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.240]   we put together this peer review system
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.520]   that would basically have an algorithm
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.160]   feed people pairs of videos,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.440]   and they would just say, which one is better?
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.080]   And then it would feed them another one.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.680]   And in the first two years,
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.360]   we just used a tool that was common for hackathons
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.680]   that did this.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.040]   And what that did is one,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.760]   it gave us a partially ordered list
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.680]   of content by quality loosely.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.880]   We didn't need it to be perfect.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.080]   We just needed there to be a very high chance
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.440]   that the five most deserving videos
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.240]   were visible somewhere in that top 100, right?
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.840]   So there, the algorithm doesn't have to be perfect.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.440]   But what happened, I think,
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.000]   is that by having this period
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.240]   when a ton of people are watching the same batch of videos,
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.680]   so a thing I've learned about the YouTube algorithm
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.360]   is in theory, you would wanna just use machine learning
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   for everything, right?
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.880]   Like you have some massive neural network
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.080]   where on the input of it,
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.000]   it's got 5 billion videos or however many exist,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.520]   and the output, it decides what seven
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.840]   are best to recommend to you.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.520]   That is completely computationally infeasible, right?
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.000]   I also think, I think this is all public knowledge.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.520]   So what you have to do instead
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.240]   is use some sort of proxies as a first pass
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.400]   to nominate a video to even be fed
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.360]   into the machine learning driven algorithm
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.800]   so that you're only feeding in like a thousand or so
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.320]   or something in the order of thousands like nominees.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.920]   So the real difference that it can make
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.560]   if you've made a really good video
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.120]   between it getting to the people who would like it
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.240]   and not getting there,
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.880]   it's not the flaws in the algorithm.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.720]   The algorithm is probably quite good.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.280]   It's the mismatch between the proxies
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.760]   being used to nominate stuff
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.720]   to see whether it's even in the running.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.120]   So one of the things used for nomination
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.600]   is understanding the co-watch graph
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.640]   where if you've watched video A
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.160]   and you've also watched video B,
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.040]   and then I watch video A,
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.760]   you're watching both of those
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.200]   gives a little link between them,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   or maybe you and a ton of other people watching both of them
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.560]   gives a little link between
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.680]   such that once I watch video A,
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.640]   B is potentially nominated in that phase
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.000]   because it's recognized that there's a lot of co-watching.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.760]   That's something that I'm sure still
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.120]   is like quite challenging at scale,
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.640]   but it's more plausible to do at scale
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.680]   than like running some massive neural network.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.360]   And so I think what might've happened
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.640]   is that by having a bunch of co-watching happening
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.800]   on this same pool of videos,
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.120]   all you need is for like some of them
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.720]   to have decent reach and get recommended, right?
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.360]   'Cause then that kicks off,
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.160]   it's like igniting a pile of kindling
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.880]   where then if others are good,
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   if they're gonna give people good experiences,
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   they get not only nominated, but then recommended,
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.800]   which then like kicks back in the feedback loop there.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.240]   So that turns out to be,
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.200]   I think as close to a guarantee as you can get of saying,
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.040]   if you make something that's good,
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.160]   it's a good piece that will satisfy someone.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.000]   They come away feeling like they learned something
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.160]   that they otherwise didn't know,
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.240]   and it was well-presented.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.920]   If you can get it into this peer review process,
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.160]   it will reach people.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.920]   It's not just gonna be shouting into the void.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.040]   And in this case, there was last year,
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.400]   I think over a hundred videos
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.080]   where after the first two weeks,
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.800]   they had more than 10,000 views,
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.760]   which I know in the grand scheme,
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.080]   people think like huge numbers of views
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:37.920]   and millions out there,
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.440]   but like for a fresh channel,
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.480]   talking about a niche mathematical topic,
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.800]   to be able to put it out
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.680]   and like get 10,000 people to watch it,
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.360]   I think is amazing, right?
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.480]   And the idea that that could happen
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.880]   for over a hundred people, I think is amazing.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.720]   So that had nothing to do with the prize pool, right?
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.120]   In that the motive might have been
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.680]   a hope of like actually getting some reach
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.000]   and having some sense of a guarantee
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.840]   of there being some reach.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.320]   Ironically, the reason to do the whole peer review system
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.160]   in the first place is in the service of selecting winners.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.240]   And so like without something
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.320]   in the service of selecting winners,
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.160]   if you just said, hey, we're having a watch fest
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.600]   where everyone watches each other's things,
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.160]   somehow it wouldn't quite have the same,
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.360]   like, I don't know, poll that gets people into it.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.000]   So I think it still makes sense to have winners
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.560]   and to have some material behind those winners.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.800]   It doesn't have to be much though.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.200]   And if anything, I think it might ruin it
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.560]   to make it too much.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.600]   I'll also say it's $15,000 actually,
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.920]   'cause we give $500 to 20 different honorable mentions,
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.160]   at least this year.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.360]   So still pretty modest in the scheme
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.000]   of like how much money you can invest
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.600]   to try to get more math lessons in the world.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.040]   I watched many of the honorable mentions as well
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.920]   because they were just topics that were interesting to me.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.720]   And I mean, it's like the thing
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.480]   that the president of Chicago University said at one point
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.840]   where he said we could discard the people we admitted
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.440]   and select the next thousand for our class
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.520]   and there would be no difference.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.240]   It was that level of, you know,
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.360]   yeah, that level of peak.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.680]   Yeah, and I really admire, by the way,
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.480]   not only the education that you're provided directly
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.100]   with your videos, which have reached millions of people,
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.400]   but the fact that you're also setting up this way
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.360]   of getting more people to contribute
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.200]   and maybe get to topics that you wouldn't have time
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.020]   to get to yourself.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:20.720]   So I really admire that you're doing that.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.980]   If you're self-teaching yourself a field
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.760]   that involves mathematics, let's say it's physics
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.080]   or some other thing like that,
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.200]   there's problems where you have to understand
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.120]   how do I put this in terms of a derivative of an integral?
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.620]   And from there it's, can I solve this integral?
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:42.160]   And what would you recommend to somebody
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.080]   who is teaching themselves, let's say quantum mechanics,
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.540]   and they, I figured out how to put,
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:49.440]   how to get the right mathematical equation here.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.000]   Is it important for their understanding
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.760]   to be able to take, go from there
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.960]   to getting it to the end result?
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.840]   Or can they just say, well, I can just abstract that out.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.280]   I understand the broader way to set up the problem
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.940]   in terms of the physics itself.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.360]   - I think where a lot of self-learners
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.920]   shoot themselves in the foot is by skipping calculations,
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.000]   by thinking that that's incidental
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.920]   to the core understanding.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:16.200]   But actually, I think you do build a lot of intuition
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.840]   just by putting in the reps of certain calculations.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.220]   Some of them maybe turn out not to be all that important.
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:24.320]   And in that case, okay, so be it.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:28.120]   But sometimes that's what maybe shapes your sense
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:32.800]   of where the substance of a result really came from.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.040]   I don't know, it might be something you realize,
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.720]   oh, it's 'cause of the square root that you get this decay.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.240]   And if you didn't really go through the exercise,
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.240]   you would just instead coming away thinking,
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.680]   such and such decays, but with other circumstances,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.520]   it doesn't decay.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:48.360]   And not really understanding what was the core part
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.200]   of this high-level result that is the thing
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.800]   you actually wanna come out remembering.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.480]   Putting in the work with the calculations
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.440]   is where you solidify all of those underlying intuitions.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.160]   And without the forcing function of homework,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.280]   we just don't do it.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   - I think that's one thing that I learned
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.280]   is a big difference post-college versus during college
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.080]   is like post-college, it's very easy in learning stuff
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.520]   to just accidentally skip that.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.560]   And then it doesn't sink in as well.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.320]   So I think when you're reading something,
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.800]   having a notebook next to you,
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.360]   just like having pen and paper, pencil and paper,
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.800]   whatever it is, should be considered part
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.460]   of the actual reading process.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.720]   And if you are relying too much on like reading
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.320]   and kind of looking up and thinking in your head,
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.800]   maybe that's gonna get something.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   But it's not gonna be as highly leveraged as it could be.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.880]   - What would be the impact of more self-teaching
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.400]   in terms of what kinds of personalities benefit most?
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.640]   So there's obviously a difference
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.320]   in the kind of person who benefits most
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.200]   in a situation where it's a college course
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.420]   and everybody has to do the homework,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.400]   but maybe some people are better tuned
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.320]   for the kind of work that's placed there
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.620]   versus all this stuff is available for you on YouTube
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.760]   and then textbooks for exercises and so on,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.280]   but you have to have the conscientiousness
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.120]   to actually go ahead and pursue it.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.600]   I mean, how do you see the distribution
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.720]   of who will benefit from the more modern way
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.400]   in which you can get whatever you want,
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.440]   but you have to push yourself to get it?
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.700]   - There's a really good book
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.720]   that's actually kind of relevant
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.520]   to some of your early questions called "Failure to Disrupt"
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.600]   that goes over the history of educational technology.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.880]   Trying to answer the question,
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.400]   you have these repeated cycles
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.520]   of people saying such and such technology
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.600]   that almost always it's getting more explanations
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.840]   to more people.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.400]   Promises that it'll disrupt the existing university system
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.840]   or disrupt the existing school system
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.640]   and just kind of never does.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.040]   You know, one of the things that it highlights
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.480]   is how stratifying these technologies will be
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.960]   in that they actually are very, very good
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.140]   for those who are already motivated
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.340]   or kind of already on the top in some way.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:56.160]   And they end up struggling the most
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.400]   just for those who are performing more poorly.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.460]   And maybe it's because of confounding causation
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.320]   where the same thing that causes someone
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.160]   to not do poorly in the traditional system
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.920]   also means that they're not gonna engage as well
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.040]   with the plethora of tools available.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.480]   I don't know if this answers your question,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.040]   but I would reemphasize that what's probably most important
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.920]   to getting people to actually learn something
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.320]   is not the explanation
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.000]   or the quality of explanations available.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.840]   'Cause since the printing press,
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.640]   that has been not literally true
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.200]   'cause maybe access to libraries and such
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.920]   isn't as universal as you would want.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.600]   But people had access to the explanation
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.140]   once they were motivated.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.160]   But instead, it's gonna be the social factors.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.680]   Like are the five best friends that you have
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.920]   also interested in this stuff?
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.000]   And do they tend to push you up
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.040]   or they tend to pull you down
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.760]   when it comes to learning more things?
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.480]   Or do you have a reason to?
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.920]   There's a job that you wanna get
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.040]   or a domain that you wanna enter
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.720]   where you just have to understand something.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.040]   Is there a personal project that you're doing?
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.640]   Like the existence of compelling personal projects
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.740]   and encouraging friend groups
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.680]   probably does way, way more
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.320]   than the average quality of explanation online ever could.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.140]   Because once you get someone motivated,
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.660]   one, they're gonna learn it.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.820]   And it maybe makes it a more fluid process
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.680]   if there's good explanations versus bad ones.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.560]   And it keeps you from having some people
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.000]   drop out of that process, which is important.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.820]   But if you're not motivating them into it
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.920]   in the first place,
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.240]   it doesn't matter if you have
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.080]   the most world-class explanations
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.200]   on every possible topic out there.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.040]   It's screaming into a void effectively.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.200]   And I don't know the best way
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.300]   to get more people to know things.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.060]   I have had a thought,
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.120]   this is the kind of thing
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.560]   that could never be done in practice,
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.840]   but instead it's something you would like
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.680]   write some kind of novel about.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.060]   Where if you want the perfect school, right?
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.120]   Something where you can insert some students
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.960]   and then you want them to get
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.120]   the best education that you can.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.400]   What you need to do is,
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.760]   let's say it's a high school.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.400]   You insert a lot of really attractive
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.960]   high schooler plants as actors
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.000]   that you get the students to develop crushes
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.760]   on the various plants, right?
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.680]   And then anything that you wanna learn,
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.800]   the plant has to express a certain interest in it.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.240]   They're like, oh, they're really interested
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.200]   in Charles Dickens or something, right?
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.480]   And they express this interest
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.720]   and then they suggest
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.960]   that they would become more interested
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.760]   in whoever your target student is
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.200]   if they also read the Dickens with them.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.600]   They're also really interested in learning the physics.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.200]   Like if you get that in a way,
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.600]   you socially engineer the setting,
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.040]   the effectiveness that that would have
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.240]   to get students to actually learn stuff
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.500]   is probably so many miles above anything else
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.040]   that we could do that nothing like that
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.320]   in practice could ever actually literally work,
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.920]   but at least viewing that as this end point of,
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.000]   okay, this mode of interaction
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.360]   would be hyper effective at education.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.640]   Is there anything that kind of gets at that, right?
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.320]   And so, okay, the kind of things that get at that,
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.000]   it would be being cognizant
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.560]   of your child's peer group or something,
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.600]   which is something that parents I think very naturally do.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.800]   Or, okay, it doesn't have to be a romantic crush,
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.040]   but it could be that there's respect for the teacher, right?
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.480]   It's someone that they genuinely respect
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.520]   and look up to such that when they say
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.520]   there's an edification to come from reading Dickens
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.200]   that that actually lands in a way.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.120]   And so taking that as a paragon
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.040]   and then letting everything else approximate that
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.080]   has, I would emphasize, nothing to do
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.480]   with the quality of online explanations
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.600]   that there are out there.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   That at best just makes it such that,
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.120]   you know, you can lubricate the process
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.000]   once someone's sufficiently interested.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.960]   - You found a new replica use case.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.760]   - Yes, I mean, I'm not saying we should do it,
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.760]   but think of how effective that would be.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.600]   - Okay, final question.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.720]   This is something I should have followed up on earlier,
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.640]   but your plans to become a high school teacher
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.040]   for some amount of years.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.120]   When are you planning on doing that
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.520]   and what do you hope to get out of that?
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   - I would say no concrete plans.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.320]   I would say I wouldn't want to do it
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.840]   in a period where like I also have young children
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.040]   and therefore it would make sense to like,
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.840]   maybe a lot of people will say this kind of thing,
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.600]   but there's friends of mine who think
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.480]   when their child is in like, you know, high school,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.720]   that's when they would want to be a high school teacher.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.400]   I think two things I would want to get out of it.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.600]   One of them, as I was emphasizing,
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.440]   I think you just lose touch
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.880]   with what it's like not to know stuff
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.680]   or what it's like to be a student.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.920]   And so maintaining that kind of connection
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.360]   so that I don't become duller and duller over time
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.640]   feels important.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   The other, I would like to live in a world
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.040]   where more people who are savvy with STEM
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.400]   spend some of their time teaching.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.520]   I just think that's one of the highest leverage ways
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.480]   that you can think of to actually get more people
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.120]   to engage with math.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   And so I would like to encourage people to do that
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.240]   and call that call to action.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.800]   Some notion of spending, maybe not your whole career,
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.600]   but a little bit of time in teaching.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.880]   There's not as fluid a system for doing that
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.200]   as say, you know, going through a tour of service
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.160]   in certain countries where everyone like,
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.000]   spends two years in the military.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.520]   So shy of having a system like that for education,
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.440]   there's all these kind of ad hoc things
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440]   where, you know, charter schools might have like
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.920]   an emergency credential system
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.400]   to like get a science teacher in.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.040]   But there's, you know, Teach for America
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.880]   is something out there.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.240]   There's enough ways that someone could spend
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.040]   a little bit of time that's probably not fully saturated
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.000]   at this point that, you know, the world would be better
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:26.960]   if more people did that.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.040]   And it would be hypocritical for me to suggest that
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:35.040]   and then not to actually put my feet where my words are.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.520]   - Yeah, well, I think that's a great note
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.200]   to leave it on Grant.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.680]   Thanks so much for coming on the podcast
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.800]   and genuinely, I mean, you're one of the people
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.880]   I really, really admire.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.200]   But what you've done for the landscape of math education
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.920]   is, I mean, it's really remarkable.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.040]   So this is a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:51.880]   - Thanks for saying that.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.720]   I had a lot of fun.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.120]   - Hey, everybody.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.040]   I hope you enjoyed that episode.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.240]   As always, the most helpful thing you can do
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.000]   is to share the podcast.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.720]   Send it to people you think might enjoy it,
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.840]   put it in Twitter, your group chats, et cetera.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.720]   It just splits the world.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.960]   Appreciate you listening.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.120]   I'll see you next time.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.960]   Cheers.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.600]   [music]
