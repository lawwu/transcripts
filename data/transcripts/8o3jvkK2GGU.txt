[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Hello and welcome to this video on how to set up a Python environment specifically for machine
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.280]   learning. So this is often an overlooked part of machine learning and there's not that many
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.480]   tutorials out there on how to do this properly. So I thought it'd be a good idea to just go through
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.960]   this and explain exactly how I set up my environment. So you can see here we have Jupyter
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.360]   and first thing you might notice is that I have these different environments. You have the default
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.360]   Python 3 base environment and then I also have this GCP which I use for the cloud and then I
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.080]   also have this one which is my machine learning environment. Now the difference between each of
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   these is the machine learning environment specifically has packages in Python for machine
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.040]   learning like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers, Pandas, NumPy. It has all of those packages but
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.240]   nothing else so there's no excess baggage if you like. So I wanted to just go through and explain
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.600]   how to actually set this up. So we're going to close this Jupyter notebook.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'm going to open this new Anaconda prompt here. So I'm assuming that you have already installed
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.840]   Python and that you are using the Anaconda distribution. So if you are not using this
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.640]   you can download it over from here. You can head over to Anaconda.com
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.480]   and you just click on products and individual edition over here.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.680]   And just download. Okay so the installation for Anaconda is pretty simple if you're on Windows.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.000]   It's a little different if you're on Linux and I don't know how it is on Mac but generally it's
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.480]   pretty straightforward and if you do need any help with it you can find out quite quickly.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:06.720]   So once we have that installed we want to go over to our Anaconda prompt and to make sure that we
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.200]   have installed it correctly we just want to type python -v and this will show us the version of
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.440]   Python that we have. So I'm at the moment using Python 3.8.3. Just make that a little bigger.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.880]   And okay if that works that's good. So at the moment we're using the core base environment that
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.760]   you can see here and that is just the default environment that gets installed whenever you
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   install the Anaconda distribution. But what we want to do is actually create a new environment
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.760]   which is our machine learning environment. So to do that we use the syntax like this. So we
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   conda create. Conda is just referring to Anaconda or name. So you can also write this as name or
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   again with n. And then you want to enter your environment name here and then you would also
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:19.680]   write Python and your Python version. And at the end of that you would also type Anaconda. So
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:30.720]   for us I'm going to use a environment name of mln like that and I also want to be installing Python
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:41.360]   3.8. And that should be everything. So we'll just enter and now Python will work through and
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:50.480]   actually install that. So I've already installed a mln before but I uninstalled it so it's coming
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.040]   up with this warning saying it already exists. But I'm going to continue creating the environment
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   because I want to reinstall it. So I put yes. You shouldn't see that on yours.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   And then this will take a little bit of time just to get everything together.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.120]   Okay so now we are just shown a list of all the packages that will be installed.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.440]   So we just want to accept that. So press yes and enter.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.880]   And that will go ahead and install all of those. Okay so everything is set up. Now we can
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.800]   switch over to our new environment. So at the moment we're in base. We can switch over to our
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.240]   new environment with conda activate and the environment name which in our case is mln.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.040]   So let's go ahead and do that.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   And now you can see that the name here is switched to mln which is our new environment.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   Now we just need to install our machine learning packages. So we're going to go ahead and install
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.720]   the basics. So we have pandas and matplotlib. We're going to install both of those with a
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.520]   conda install. So we have two options here. We have conda or pip to install our packages.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.400]   Generally conda will most likely integrate with your environment better. So it's usually a good
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.200]   idea to try that first. If that doesn't work then try pip install. So we'll go ahead and
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800]   conda install. We're going to do pandas and matplotlib.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:41.920]   Then add anything else here that you feel that you might also need. But this is all we're going
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.800]   to go with. So it's a good point noting that we also need numpy but numpy is included as a
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.240]   dependency of pandas so we don't need to explicitly mention numpy here. And that will go ahead and
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.200]   ask us for permission to install the packages that it finds. We click yes and then we go ahead
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   with the installation again. Now we can go ahead and install fenceflow, transformers and pandas.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.960]   And pytorch which are all machine learning frameworks. So tenseflow we can install it
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.360]   quite easily. All we need to do is conda install tenseflow. Okay so now we have the yes or no
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:36.480]   from tenseflow. Okay so tenseflow is now installed so we can now go ahead and install transformers.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.040]   So transformers we are going to use pip because conda doesn't recognize the most
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.000]   recent versions of the transformers library at the time of recording at least.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.960]   So we have to use pip to get the most recent versions. So we pip install transformers.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:06.880]   There we go. And finally we have pytorch which is slightly more complex but we make it quite easy
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.280]   by just taking a look at the pytorch start locally guide which you can find here.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:23.040]   So pytorch.org get started locally and all we do is we come down to the start locally bit
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.800]   and we select our pytorch build. So this is the stable release and this is like a beta release
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.560]   which gets released more often but it's more like to have bugs and errors in. So I think most people
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   will probably want to avoid this. You can choose your OS so for me it's windows. Package manager
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.440]   so that is conda you can also use pip but I would recommend conda because it will
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   install the dependencies we need as well. We're using python and then this bottom one here
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:08.400]   refers to cuda. So we use cuda as the gpu acceleration library so essentially with this
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.280]   if you have a nvidia gpu cuda lets you use it speed up any machine learning tasks that you have
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:24.160]   in either pytorch or tensorflow. So you can read tensorflow's gpu setup guide if you do have a gpu
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:32.800]   this is quite useful so you just head on down to the bottom here or if you're on linux this guide
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:40.000]   is always quite useful. And then we have the windows setup here so all you need to do is
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.480]   install all of these which is reasonably straight forward but there are a lot of good guides out
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.840]   there if you do need help with it. And then you just head on down and set your paths so that
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.440]   tensorflow slash pytorch can actually see cuda. Another useful guide as well is this nvidia cuda
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.760]   installation guide which can be quite useful as well. Now I would recommend using cuda 10.2
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:20.080]   at the time of recording so unless you're using the latest rtx 30 series so that is the nvidia
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   geforce rtx 3090, 3080 and I think it's 3070. So the support for those is a little bit sketchy at
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.720]   the moment and you will actually need cuda 11 alongside the nightly builds of pytorch and
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:43.680]   tensorflow so this is what I mentioned over here. That's a little bit more difficult and I'm not
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.560]   going to be covering that here but again there are a lot of good guides out there if you do
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.520]   need help with it. So if you don't have a gpu or you just don't care about gpu acceleration you
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.920]   just click none and it will change the command down here which we'll be using for our installation.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.400]   So I'll be using this command here. So we're doing a conda install
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.000]   and then we have a few packages not just pytorch here. So pytorch, torchvision,
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   torch audio, cuda toolkit and first we are using a 10.2 and then we
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.800]   set our channel to pytorch as well. Now we can go ahead and install that.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.160]   So just select yes again and now that is our environment completely set up.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.240]   So all we need to do now is actually add this environment to Jupyter. So remember at the start
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.040]   we had that little box and we had python3 gcp and ml so we're gonna add a new one called ml
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:19.280]   environment. So to do that we need to install ipykernel and with that ipykernel we are going
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:28.240]   to install our new environment. So we do that by specifying the name of it here mln
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.320]   and then we also want to set the display name. So this is the name that we will see when we
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:41.840]   enter into JupyterLab and we can have that box. So this can be anything you want.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:49.680]   So for me I'm just going to put ml environment.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.360]   And we just run that again. Okay so that is ready and now we can just
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.120]   go ahead switch back to our base environment which is our default environment
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.000]   and now just open up JupyterLab.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:23.120]   And we can see here we now have this other ml environment and this is the one that we just
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:30.400]   created. So that is it for this short video. I hope it's been useful and I will see you again
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.960]   in the next one. Thanks for watching. Bye.
