[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   [silence]
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.380]   If you go into the store or even a convenience store,
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.200]   you will see pH water.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.280]   Now, every water has a pH, right?
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.060]   Lower numbers mean more acidic,
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.620]   higher numbers mean more alkaline or more basic.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.240]   You'll see pH water that is 7.4, you'll see 7.8,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.120]   you'll see 9.8, you'll see a huge range of these things,
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.940]   and there are many, many different claims
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.720]   about how the pH of water is important
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.840]   for regulating the pH of the body.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.180]   Here's the real story.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.560]   The pH of your body, that is the pH of the cells
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.240]   at different locations in your body,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.280]   is strongly, strongly homeostatically regulated.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.300]   What do I mean by that?
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080]   It means it doesn't change that much,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.360]   which means that you have
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.480]   very specific biological mechanisms
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.980]   that ensure the pH is maintained, for instance,
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.320]   in the skin cells of your skin,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   in the retinal cells of your eye, in your brain cells.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.620]   Now, it is true that across the body,
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.200]   different cells and tissues have fairly widely varying pH.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.240]   Now, it has been said that the pH of bodily tissues
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.600]   is generally between 7.2 and 7.4.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.680]   However, if you were to look at the pH of your gut,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.040]   and keep in mind that your gut is not just your stomach,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.860]   your gut is the entire pathway
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.200]   ranging from your throat all the way down
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.440]   to where you excrete things out of your body,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.940]   that entire pathway has different pH levels
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.120]   depending on where you are
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   along the gut and intestinal pathway.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.020]   And in fact, having much lower, that is more acidic pH
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.820]   at certain locations along your gut pathway
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.520]   is what allows those gut microbiota,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.880]   those little microorganisms of which you have trillions
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   that are important for regulating everything
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.920]   from neurotransmitter production to hormone production
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.080]   that allow them to flourish and do well.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.820]   That said, except under conditions of hemorrhage
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.660]   or changes in blood volume that are of a dangerous level
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.820]   that can lead to seizure or even death,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.660]   the pH of the rest of the cells of your body
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.780]   and also those gut cells doesn't change that much
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.440]   on a moment-to-moment basis.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080]   So if somebody tells you
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.100]   that you should drink alkaline water
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.940]   or alkalized water as it's sometimes called,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   in order to keep your body more alkaline and less acidic,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.800]   there is essentially no basis for that
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.880]   at a macroscopic level or even at a local level.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   Now, what that does not mean
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.240]   is that the pH of the water that you drink is not important.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.920]   In fact, if the pH of the water that you drink is too low,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   that is if the water that you consume is too acidic,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.500]   it will not move as quickly from your gut
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.180]   into the other regions of your body,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.980]   and therefore the other cells of your body
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.020]   that require that water
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.740]   will not be able to access it as readily.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.260]   You've probably experienced this
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.100]   if you've consumed certain water
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.360]   and it feels like it's sloshing around in your stomach
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.060]   or it feels like it's just somehow staying there
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.380]   or you feel its presence more, not just as volume,
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.060]   but it's almost as if you can feel the little waves of water
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.220]   along the inside of your gut.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now, sometimes that can relate to temperature,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.560]   but oftentimes that can relate to the pH of that water.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.240]   And it turns out it is true that water
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   that is more alkaline, that is pHs of 7.4 or higher,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.720]   can move more readily across the aquaporin channel.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.840]   And in terms of absorption of water
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   from the endothelial lining
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.360]   and the other cell type lining of your gut
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.160]   into the rest of your body,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.120]   it is true that higher pH water,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.460]   provided that pH isn't too high,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.740]   is going to be absorbed more quickly,
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.900]   which partially explains why some people have an affinity
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.320]   for this higher pH water.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.140]   Now, this is not to say that you need to consume
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.300]   high pH water in order to hydrate your body properly.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.720]   I want to be very clear about that.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940]   However, if you are interested
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.140]   in what the value of elevated pH water is,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.820]   it largely has to do with this accelerated absorption.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.900]   There is also growing evidence
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.280]   that it can adjust the function of certain cells
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.460]   that are within your immune system
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.320]   and thereby reduce certain inflammatory responses.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080]   So I realize as I'm saying this,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.500]   some people out there are probably thinking,
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.560]   oh no, this guy's like a pH water proponent.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.840]   He's saying we have to drink alkaline water
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   or buy very fancy water.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.720]   Now, I want to be clear, that is not what I'm saying.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   And I'm also not saying that you need
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680]   to purchase very expensive water
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.900]   in order to derive the maximum benefits
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.960]   from the water that you drink.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.880]   It turns out there are a few things that you can do,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   by way of temperature and by way of filtering water
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.080]   and a few other tricks
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.360]   that I'll tell you a little bit later,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   that will allow you to increase the absorption rate
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.060]   of water in the gut,
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.560]   which turns out to be a very interesting,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.300]   but also potentially important thing to do
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.120]   for not just reducing inflammation,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.000]   but also making sure that you're getting proper hydration
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.680]   of different cell types in your body,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   including rapid hydration of your brain cells,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.600]   which can greatly enhance cognitive function.
