[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.240]   and what they call the military specifications for the weapon became public and what that did for the industry was it gave everybody the same foundation to build on so if you can imagine proprietary designs only the manufacturer would really know all the details and everybody else kind of has to figure it out on their own when they're designing a weapon and they're making a design with the same foundation that they were building on so it's a very, very important point to consider as well.

[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.500]   is a really great illustration of what happens with the free market when it's allowed to do its thing. Right, right. So you can, with the AR platform, you could buy anything from, I mean, what would you say is in current market as we record this in end of February 2018, I would say current market price, the last gun show I went to for a completed put together a complete AR ready to shoot out of the box. We're not talking about a parted kitted one that you build your own.

[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.980]   Because you can buy.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:58.380]   So again, the actual firearm is considered, but for legislation, what's called lower receiver.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.880]   You could buy a mil spec lower receiver for what?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.780]   The 40 bucks.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.280]   Yeah, they've been around 40, $50 for quite a while.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.680]   Right.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.380]   And so this is not, if you're not a, if you're not familiar with the design, not familiar with the platform, not familiar with guns.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.560]   When I say lower receiver, this is not something that you can.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:46.580]  , actually.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:46.580]   It's not something that you can actually put a bullet in and pull the trigger.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:46.580]   That has a little mechanism in it and you just pay 40 bucks for that. You have to add. Yeah, it's literally a piece of metal with holes drilled in the right places in the right shape, but it has a serial number on it and that's what's considered legally the firearm and so probably the cheapest way to do it is to build it yourself. You can put together a kit, you buy the lower receiver and the way the law works is basically to build it yourself.

[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   But the big thing is buy ammo and buy training and buy range time. Those are the things that people miss. They don't buy ammo, they don't buy training and they don't buy range time. And because of that they aren't effective with their weapons. Right and that's really the one thing I haven't mentioned all is accessories but they are pretty essential and there's a big difference between people who buy guns because they
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:15.880]  ,
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:45.900]   and people actually buy them because they want to use them for whatever use. If you're going to use a gun you're going to need some accessories on there at least minimum sights. Most likely you're going to want some kind of red dot which vary greatly in price. I mean maybe $50 up to 600 or whatever a red dot is a sighting mechanism that puts a hologram of a red dot on your target and it's special because it provides fast target acquisition allows you to bring the
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:45.900]   red dot on your target and it's special because it provides fast target acquisition allows you to bring the

That's all before you get into the very important element of training, which, you know, weekend class is going to cost you probably at least two to $300. But it's very important, very essential. And ammunition get expensive right now. I didn't check today, but let's just say in the vicinity of 20 something to 30 cents around, maybe the 40, maybe more than that. Sorry, that's old prices. I'm thinking 9mm.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:40.560]  , okay, so I was around box of 556. Not cheap. Right, you're looking around 50 cents around. And you can run through some money very quickly, just doing some basic training. So, personally, my perspective, it is, I'm very passionate about the high quality stuff. But if you're getting practical, your money is best, much better spent on things like decent accessories, training, and you know, you know, you're going to get a lot of money.

[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   Sure.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:22.100]  .
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.100]   You can buy them at the same time, you know, you can wait for the deal and the one you want, but what you'll find very quickly is that the cheapest assembled guns, they generally limit your ability to accessorize.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.140]   from PSA, it's about the same price.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:24.140]   Other elements like the stock, a nicer stock, or that's probably the big ones, the handguard in the stock, or even the barrel.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.140]   Quality, you know, actually, I like the idea of stainless steel barrels, so I don't have to worry too much about rust, so you may get a better barrel for the same price.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   So I'm not sure how you can get below that $450 to $500 mark with a complete rifle, but without building it yourself, and you probably don't save that much, but you can get a better barrel for the same price.

[00:56:53.100 --> 00:57:22.100]  , but you can get more for your money by going that route, you know, assemble, separating the upper from the lower.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   That's my recommendation.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   Check out Palmer State Armory.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   The biggest thing I would say, if you don't, if you're not familiar with it, just ask around.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   Find a buddy who has one and go shoot it, and get over the fear of it, and then ask them for advice.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   Go to a gun show. If you go to a gun show, go to a gun shop, go to a local gun shop.
