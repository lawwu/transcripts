[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, inspiration, and encouragement you need

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   while also building a plan for financial freedom

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Joshua, and I am your host,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and today I'm gonna give you some practical advice
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   on how to buy an AR-15 and not get taken.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   (laughs)
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   How's that for wading into the fires of current controversy?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   But frankly, AR-15s are wonderful guns,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and I think you should have one
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   for reasons that I have enumerated elsewhere
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   in terms of the moral and philosophical arguments.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Of course, it's your money,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   but it's hard to see how you can go wrong
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   with going ahead and parting with some of it
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   to purchase an AR-15 for yourself,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and I thought you might enjoy a little bit
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   of straightforward discussion on how to do that.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So I've got my buddy Mike.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Mike, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   - Thanks, glad to be here.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   - My friend Mike is a, I don't know,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   do you call yourself a gun nut?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   - Absolutely, self-labeled gun nut.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   - Some gun people hate that term, and some don't,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   but I'll call you a gun nut,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and more specifically, I would call you an AR nut,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   because of all the people that I know,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I don't know of anybody that's put more time and thought
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   into specifically the AR, what's called the AR platform.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So let's start by talking about
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   what an AR-15 actually is,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and then we'll move into why buying one.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So what is an AR-15?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   - AR-15 would be a general term,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   not sure if it actually has a technical definition,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   but it's a pretty widely accepted general term
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   that describes a firearm design
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   that originated, let's call it the Vietnam era,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and became well-known.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It started becoming issued to the US military
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   in that period, and then has basically,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   in various variations, has been the standard rifle
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   for the United States infantrymen ever since.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And along the way, I'm not up on all the details
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   of exactly what happened when,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   but basically, they started using the same design
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   for civilian use, and it's developed quite a bit.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's actually, the civilian versions
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   are much more advanced now,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   in terms of the technical advancements,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   than the military versions.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The military's pretty slow to adopt new weapons,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but essentially, it's the same weapon,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   with the only distinction being full-auto
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   in the military versus semi-auto in civilians.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   - If you were to go back and research the history,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   in the military, I guess it was the M16,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   probably A1 was the first one,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and then it came out to the A2.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But if you go back and you look at Vietnam,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   you'll see the guys carrying around
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   the big old black carry handle on the top,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   they're M16s.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And then the civilian version of that
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   came out as the AR-15,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and there are different variants of that today.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But it really was a revolutionary design,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   where, in terms of rifles,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   there was a major change in military history,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   as far as why the US military went away
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   from a larger caliber, heavier,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   what's called a battle rifle.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The AR-15 or the M16 are not considered
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   to be a battle rifle.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So there's a whole kind of interesting side road
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   to that discussion.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But when it came out in the civilian market,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   it has, in many ways,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   revolutionized the rifle marketplace.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's why it is the most popular
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   firearm rifle that's sold
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   in the United States of America.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And I would say,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   how would you characterize why it's so popular?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I would say, one, it's modular.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   - Right.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   What's really special about it
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   is not so much,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   in some ways, it was ahead of its time
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   when it was designed,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   and there are better designs out by now.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   But what makes it what it is today
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   is the fact that, of course,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   for the first period of time after it was designed,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   there were patents and stuff like that.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And then at a certain point,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   patents expired,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and what they call the military specifications
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   for the weapon became public.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And what that did for the industry
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   was it gave everybody the same foundation to build on.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So if you can imagine proprietary designs,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   only the manufacturer would really know all the details,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and everybody else kind of has to figure it out on their own.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   When the military specifications
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   became available to everybody,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   it basically gave everybody the same blueprints to work from,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   which means everything is compatible.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So basically, a mil-spec AR is the term
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   for something that's based on those designs,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   which means that everything that is mil-spec is compatible.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And one way that it makes it--
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   they call it "Legos for Men"
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   because that makes everything modular
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   because everybody knows that they can make stuff
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   that's compatible with everybody else's stuff.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And in terms of the free market,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   you can just imagine how powerful that is.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   - It's been especially powerful, too,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   because with the exception of what, on the AR-15 rifle,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   is called the lower receiver,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   the lower receiver,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   which is the part that's stamped
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   with the serial number for the gun,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   that's the only thing that's technically,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   according to the law, considered to be a firearm.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So that's the only piece of it
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   that is actually regulated as a firearm.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Every other individual component,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   whether that's the stock, the sight system,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   the barrel, you know, the grips,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   every other component of the rifle
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   can be freely bought and sold on the public market,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   can be bought through the mail,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   it can be bought over the internet.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You don't have to deal with the federal firearms licensing.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And so that's led to just this massive proliferation
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   of quality accessories,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   ranging from the cheap to the very high end,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that you can swap in and out
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   of a huge majority of the rifles.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   - Right, and, you know,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   we had the assault weapons ban of '94 under Clinton,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   which, incidentally,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   was probably one of the main factors
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   that fueled the Republican Revolution
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   to take over the House in '94.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   - Definitely.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   - And so that kind of kept a lid on the market for 10 years.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But in '04, when that expired and was not renewed,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   the market just exploded.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And like you say, you can--
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   the range is so big,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   from the cheapest to the most expensive,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and everything in between,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   that it's just a really great illustration
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   of what happens with the free market
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   when it's allowed to do its thing.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   - Right, right.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So you can-- with the AR platform,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   you could buy anything from--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I mean, what would you say is,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   in current market, as we record this
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   in end of February 2018,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I would say current market price,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   the last gun show I went to,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   for a completed, put together,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   a complete AR, ready to shoot out of the box.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We're not talking about a parted,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   kitted one that you build yourself.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But a complete AR, probably in the range of $600.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   - Yeah, you know, they say that Obama
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   was the best gun salesman ever,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and prices actually stayed high
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   because everybody was a little bit nervous
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   about what might happen under him
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   with the regulations.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   But after the election and Trump winning,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   it actually was really bad for the market,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and so the prices went down below that
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   to the point where you can find a name brand,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   a complete rifle,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   entry level for probably under $500.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   - Right, right.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And that's not even necessarily
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   the cheapest way to put a rifle together.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Because you can buy--
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   so again, the actual firearm
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   is considered, but for legislation,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   what's called lower receiver.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You could buy a mil-spec lower receiver for what?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   40 bucks?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   - Yeah, they've been around $40 to $50
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   for quite a while.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   - Right.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And so this is not--
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   if you're not familiar with the design,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   you're not familiar with the platform,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   you're not familiar with guns,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   when I say lower receiver,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   this is not something that you can actually
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   put a bullet in and pull the trigger.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   All you have is this little box of metal
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   that has a little mechanism in it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And you just pay 40 bucks for that.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   You have to add--
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   - Yeah, it's literally a piece of metal
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   with holes drilled in the right places
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   in the right shape.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   - But it has a serial number on it,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and that's what's considered legally the firearm.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And so probably the cheapest way to do it
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   is to build it yourself.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   You can put together a kit,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   you buy the lower receiver,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and the way the law works is
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   to buy that lower receiver
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   in the new marketplace,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   you have to go and buy that
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   from a federally licensed firearms dealer.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   If you're gonna buy it online,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   if you ever go and you're shopping online,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   you're gonna buy it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   The way that works is your product
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   has to be shipped to you
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   through a federal firearms licensee.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   So if you've never bought a gun online,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   you can buy it online,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   but they don't just ship it right to your house.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You have to set up a relationship
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   with a local FFL,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   is the acronym for it,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   a local federal firearms dealer
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   who will run the background check,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   take the appropriate paperwork,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   make sure that you pass it
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   if you have waiting periods or things like that
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   you have to deal with.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   They're the ones who are responsible
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   for following all the federal regulations.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But then once you get that little piece,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   you can order the other pieces.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   - Yeah, just to be clear,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   the purchase price of these things right now
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   might be around $40 to $50.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You may have to add shipping on top of that,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and then most of these dealers
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   would charge some kind of transfer fee.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It can range from $25 to $30 up to more.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So if you find some small guy
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   who's just running his business out of his house,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   then he's gonna be cheap.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So add that into the cost.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Of course, if you buy multiple ones,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   you may get a volume discount.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But if you're just gonna buy one,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   figure by the time it's delivered,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   you may be closer to $100,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   but it's still pretty cheap.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   - Right.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So then in my analysis,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   you can buy different variations.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You could buy, if you knew what you were doing
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   or if you knew what you wanted,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   you can buy each of the components
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and then put the gun together yourself.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It requires, what did you say, some basic skills?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   - Yeah, it's really that's going back
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   to what makes the AR-15 special.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   For example, the big alternative generally
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   is the AK-47 or AK-74.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Those are--
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   - The difference between those is that the AK-70--
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Sorry, the AK-47 fires a larger round,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   basically almost a 30 caliber round,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   a 7.62 millimeter round,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   whereas the AK-74 is the AK design
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   that is comparable to the AR-15 caliber.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   What is that, the 5.45?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   - 4.5, yeah.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   - Right, 5.45 millimeters.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So an AK-74 fires a very small bullet,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   just like we should note,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   if you're not familiar with AR-15s.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   AR-15s generally,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   and you can get them in different calipers,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   but an AR-15 fires a very small,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   relatively small bullet.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   You'll hear that referred to,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and there's two different sizes of,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   they're chambered in,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   either in what's called 5.56 millimeter NATO
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   or .223 inches,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and they are almost equivalent.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   They're not necessarily interchangeable all the time,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   but they're basically interchangeable.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And to that bullet, just for sake of comparison,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   the actual bullet size of the cartridge,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   of the round,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   the actual bullet size that comes out of a standard AR-15
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   is the same size as a .22 long rifle
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   that you plink in your backyard,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   but it has a lot more powder behind it.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It comes out at a much higher velocity,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   but it's--
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   - And it's also heavier.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   - Right, and it's heavier.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   - Longer.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   - But in terms of the size of the bullet,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   it's much smaller.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Now, you can take the AR-15 gun design
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   and you can chamber it in different calibers.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So there's a big, in the enthusiast community,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   there's a big push towards something called a 300 blackout,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   or you can buy an AR-10,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   which fires a round that is a .308 size bullet.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But why was I telling about the bullet size?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Just that it's a relatively small gun.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So that's the difference between AK-47 and AK-74.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   - We'll call it AK for now,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   but the point I was gonna make is that
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   the AK is a design that was come out of, you know,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Soviet industrial world
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   where they're making these things in big factories
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   over there in Yugoslavia or wherever they might be.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And it requires some significant machine tools
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   to assemble parts of it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I think part of it has to be pressed together
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and stuff like that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Anyway, the AR literally is nothing but hand tools.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And you won't find these tools at Home Depot,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   but they're readily available online.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   They're relatively affordable.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   So if you wanted to,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   depending on how much you want to get the specialized tools
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   to make things easier,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   but some basic hand tools and maybe a vice
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   to hold everything in place for you,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and you can literally assemble the entire thing
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   from a bag of parts to a complete gun ready to fire,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   you know, right there in your home.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   - Right.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And so every gun platform has its advantages and disadvantages.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Some people love the AK platform,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   but the AK platform is not modular like the AR is,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   at least that's my knowledge, right?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   - There's no mil spec for AK.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   - So you can buy a high-end AK,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   you can buy a low-end AK.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   - They wish there was.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   - And people still love them.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And you can pick them up out of the dirt
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and wipe it out and shoot them.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That's the whole point of why they're so popular
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   on a global basis.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   But they don't have the ability of an AR to be customized.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So the big valuable thing I would say about it,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   one of the reasons why people love the AR platform
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   is it's upgradable and it can be designed
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   for a specific purpose.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So upgradable, you can buy a cheap AR-15
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   as an entry-level, you know, starter firearm.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   You've got 800 bucks, you buy an inexpensive one
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and buy some ammo to go with it.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   But then over time, if you have more money,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   you can swap out the trigger for a better trigger,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   you can swap out the barrel for a better barrel,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   you can add some gear to the front of it
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   to make it have a red dot or a laser or lights
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and all the stuff.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And so you can start simple and upgrade from there.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And that's really, really powerful
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   because it gives the people the ability to buy one rifle
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and to improve it over time.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The second thing that in my mind makes an AR-15 so powerful
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   is that it can be adjusted to fit your specific needs and goals.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So if you have a specific application,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   most guns are compromises.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You're usually compromising something
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   to fit specific needs.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   But if you want an AR-15 that can do relatively consistent,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   accurate, medium-distance shooting,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   it's not a long-range platform,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   it just doesn't have the ballistic characteristics
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   to shoot effectively at very long ranges.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   But if you want one that's accurate
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   at medium-distance ranges,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   out to a couple hundred, 300 yards,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   you can put that together, you can build it,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   you can put a quality barrel,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   you can put a quality sighting system.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   But on the other hand,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   if you want something that is short and small
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   to use as your home defense gun
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   or to use in an application
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   where you need to fit it into a very small package,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   you, depending on how short you go,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   you have the ability to do that as well.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So one gun can be changed to meet different applications.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Yeah, and speaking of accuracy for a minute,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   that is one of the wonderful things about the design.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And to this day, I'm not sure that there is anybody
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   who has developed a better design
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   that is capable of more accuracy
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   than that platform is capable of.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And a lot of people like to make fun of the AK
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   and say it's a minute of barn or something like that.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   The AK is not known for its accuracy.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   The AR, even the military specification for the AR
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   is very generous.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   They put it in terms of MOA,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   so a 4 MOA would basically be--
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   MOA is an acronym that stands for minute of angle.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Right, and what it really means is that 100 yards,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   your distribution of the various shots
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   might be inside a 4-inch circle.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Well, a $500 or less,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   maybe even entry-level gun,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   is probably at least half of that.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It could very easily, with the right ammunition, be 2 MOA.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And then when you start doing various modifications,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   whatever they may be,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   there's plenty of people--
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   well, even factory guns-- that can do under 1 MOA,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   which means that if you shoot 3 bullets
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   at the same spot on a target,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   the variance between them is going to be less than an inch.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And that is something inherent to the design
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   that, like I said, there's brand-new designs
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   coming out now that often can't even do that.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Right, so explain what makes it so inherently accurate
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   with the way that the mechanism actually works.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Well, the technical aspect of it--
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I'm not sure I could speak really authoritatively on that,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   but, you know, part of it is the design,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and part of it is the widespread availability
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   of quality components.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   So, for example, the biggest factors in accuracy
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   is going to be the barrel,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and then after that's going to be the trigger.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And so, you know, you can get your $500 gun,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and then whenever you decide you want to get a nicer barrel,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   if you've got the tools to do it,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   then you can swap that out, and all of a sudden
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   you've made a much more accurate gun.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And frankly, there are--
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   often they're used as-- they call it varmint guns,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and that's things like prairie dogs
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   that they do out west for hunting,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   where it's a very long distance with a small bullet.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And, you know, those guys do some amazing things,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   but, you know, you get a better trigger
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and just swap it in there.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Right.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Yeah, it's probably too hard to go through
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   the technical characteristics of how the action
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   actually operates in an audio format,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   but if you're interested, go on YouTube.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   There's plenty of things available to understand.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   It has a fundamentally--
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   just a really neat way that it handles
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   the actual mechanism of cycling the action,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   which makes it a powerful platform.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   In terms of applications, talk about
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   some of the different applications
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   that you've seen people build them for
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   that make it so versatile.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Sure, and maybe I could just also put that
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   in the context of needs.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And, you know, one thing you have to be aware of
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   if you're getting into this world is that
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   the people who are the most active online
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and in the dialogues are probably the enthusiasts.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   They're not the normal people.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And so, you know, us gun nuts can get pretty
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   obsessive about things that you really
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   don't need to care about, and it can be difficult
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   to weed through all that just to find what you need.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But, you know, in terms of application,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   many people simply buy these things for self-defense.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You know, they may have to use a handgun
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   because they can't carry a rifle around them every day,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   but if they're at home or they're near a vehicle
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   or there's something special going on,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the rifle is far superior to a handgun
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   or any self-defense situation.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And for that, you really don't need that much.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Yeah, a rifle is superior in a self-defense situation
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   for multiple reasons.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I'll give mine and then you add yours.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   One, it's easier to shoot a rifle accurately
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   than to shoot a handgun accurately,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   just simply based upon the length of the barrel
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   and the pointing mechanism.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You can teach a novice shooter.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I could take a 12-year-old boy or girl
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and put an AR-15 in their hands,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and in a couple of hours of instruction,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   you can have them reliably hitting rounds accurately
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   because of the fact that it's a rifle versus a handgun.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Multiple points of stabilization.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Right, right.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You have--I'm going to get so technical.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's just an inherently more stable platform,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and it's easier to shoot accurately.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Number two, an AR-15 is a really ideal thing
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   for a home defense weapon
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   just because of its standard capacity
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   of the number of rounds that it can carry.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   A standard capacity magazine for an AR-15 is 30 rounds.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Now, you can buy them that are 20 rounds.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   If you live in California, you can buy them with 10 rounds.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   You can buy them with 40 rounds,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and you can buy drums that are more,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   but you can buy a 100-round drum,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   but it gets so heavy, you can't do it.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   But just a standard AR-15 30-round magazine,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   which in today's market is--you can buy for $10,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   which is just amazing.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Those people who lived through the assault weapons ban
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   from '94 to '04 used to pay through the nose
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   for a pre-ban magazine.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   But a standard magazine gives you 30 rounds,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and so you put an AR-15 with a 30-round capacity
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   in the hands of a basic shooter.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You've put a very effective weapon
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   in the hands of a basic shooter
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   in a situation like a home defense type of scenario.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   - Yeah, and just to inject a little bit of reality
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   into the political discourse that's going on right now,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   a lot of people have this perception of the AR-15
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   incorrectly labeled an assault weapon,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   but let's just, you know, say it's the same thing.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We're all talking about the same thing.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   The round itself is actually not that effective
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   against, you know, a human target,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   which is basically what we're talking about in self-defense.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   You're shooting a human who legally needs to be shot.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   It's an unpleasant reality, but it's there.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And, you know, I think you talk to any soldier
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   who's used this gun--or, sorry, to be more accurate,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   this caliber, this cartridge in combat.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   They'll tell you that they may have needed to do
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   shooting an enemy soldier multiple times
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   before, you know, they went down.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And so a lot of people look at this question
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   of a high-capacity magazine and say,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   "What do you need all that for?"
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Well, the truth is that even if you're hitting your target,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   you probably need to hit them multiple times
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   because, let's be realistic,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   if you are shooting a gun in self-defense,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   you need to stop that person immediately.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Otherwise, it's probably not justified.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And so you need to immediately stop that person
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   from being the threat that they are presenting.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And so that's one of the great things about the AR-15,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   is that you don't have to reload very quickly.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And so you are able to use that weapon effectively
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   to do what you need to do.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And as soon as additional threats are added--
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   for example, a group of people
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   who are all posing a threat--
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   you suddenly may run out of bullets very quickly
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   with a 30-round magazine.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And that's assuming you're hitting your target,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   which--
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   - I should not be assumed.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   - I actually looked this up, and I was amazed that--
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and it's probably not a--
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   you know, it's a little misleading
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   because they compared the number of bullets purchased--
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I mean, technically correct.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Somebody's going to give me a hard time about this.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   But the number of cartridges purchased by the military
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   to the number of confirmed kills.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   And it was literally 250,000.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   - To one.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   - To one.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   So I don't know that that's an actual representation
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   of how many rounds a soldier fires per target.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But it was kind of silly.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And even police, you know, their hit rates
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   are below 30% generally in the statistics.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So, you know, just to put
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   the high-capacity magazine in perspective,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   it's not what people think it is.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And in terms of using this gun for legal purposes,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   it's actually a very important asset.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   - Right, right.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And the other benefit of the AR-15 platform,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   specifically of the relatively small-caliber bullet--
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and this is one of the reasons, in my understanding,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   that the military moved some of their foot soldiers to it--
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   was unlike a larger .308,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   which was the previous standard,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   all the way up through Vietnam,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   unlike a larger--a larger bullet is heavier.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So you can carry fewer rounds with you.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Whereas the smaller cartridge,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   the .223 caliber, the 5.56 that the AR-15 fires,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   is smaller, it's lighter, you can carry more rounds.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   But what it means is I can take a standard AR,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   put a 30-round magazine in it,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   it comes--tips the scales at, what, 7 pounds,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   something like that? - Yeah, loaded.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   - 6 to 8 pounds? - 6 to 8.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   - So I can give that rifle, which doesn't have an--
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   especially if it doesn't have a very long barrel on it,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I can give that rifle to my 115-pound wife,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and she is equalized in her ability
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   to have a powerful, useful firearm that she can hold.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   She's not gonna hold an M1 Garand.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I could put an M1 Garand in her hand and say,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   "Here are a couple of stripper clips."
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   The M1 Garand was a standard rifle
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   for World War I, World War II, but I could say,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   "Here are a couple of stripper clips."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   She can't hold the thing, 'cause empty, it's what?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   It's like 12 or 13 pounds empty. - I don't know if it's heavy.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   - Whereas an AR is light, and it really is effective.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   So it's really--it's a wonderful platform.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's a miracle of modern technology.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   - Yeah, so just real quick, to go back
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   to your original question about applications,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   your basic entry-level rifle is gonna be pretty sufficient
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   for self-defense, but if you do want something shorter,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   that is possible.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Unfortunately, the price you pay for a shorter barrel
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   is a bigger fireball coming out the end,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   'cause there's powder that's not being used
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   to propel that bullet, but it can be done very easily.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And again, one thing I forgot to mention
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   was you don't have to swap out barrels.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   One of the things that--again, going back to how nice
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   the design is, these things are separated
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   into lowers and uppers, and often what people do
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   is they will have one lower component,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and then they will swap out multiple uppers very easily,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   and you don't have to use any tools.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You just pop a couple pins in and out.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And so for whatever your application is,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   you just pop it out, pop it in,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and you've got a completely different gun
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that doesn't require any tools to set up.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's all--you know, even the optic is mounted and zeroed,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and you're ready to go.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   So shorter uppers, if you want something more compact,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   are very easily either purchased or built.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And then, of course, if you are using it
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   for something beyond that,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   where either you're going the longer distance,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   which, you know, you have to be realistic
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   about self-defense.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   If somebody's 100 yards away,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   it's hard to build the case for legal self-defense.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   - That's if you're in a war and we're not.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   There's no legal case you can make for that.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   - Yeah, so beyond that, it goes primarily
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   into hunting and recreation.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And there, it's pretty much whatever you want to do,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   whether it's a longer barrel to get more range,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   whether it's a more accurate barrel,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   or going back to what Joshua was saying
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   about the calibers.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Let's say you do want a bigger caliber for hunting.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   You can have that set up in a separate upper
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   that you just pop on,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   and now you're ready with something.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   It's actually not legal, I believe, in most states,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   if not all, to shoot deer with this caliber.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   It's not considered humane.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   So, but you can easily--
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   - Because it's too small.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   - Right, right.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   - It's not big enough.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   - It's not gonna be a quick kill.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It's not gonna be humane to the animal.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's gonna result in a wounded animal
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   that's a very undesirable situation for many reasons.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   But you can swap in that larger caliber
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   very easily for hunting.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And, you know, again,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   there are what they call pistol versions,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   which actually don't have a stock,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   but have their applications,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   whether being shorter or getting around--
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   You know, some states have regulations
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   that are a little more restricted than others,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   but the pistol variation can help you
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   get around some of that legally
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and still be able to accomplish
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   what you're trying to do.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   - And also, just the ability with the barrels.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   You can--
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Some people, many people will shorten up
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and buy a short barrel.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Some of them, if you go too short,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   then you have to apply and pay the federal government
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   a $200 tax stamp for the privilege
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   of having your barrel and get it registered.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The barrel thing primarily comes from
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   the era of gangsters in the '20s and '30s,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and they didn't like these gangsters
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   hiding their guns underneath their trench coats,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   so they thought that they were going to solve
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that problem with restrictions on the barrels.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   But one thing I didn't mention in this conversation,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   in this question, is adding a suppressor,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   a silencer, it's becoming much more common,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and, you know, a lot of people,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   all they know about that is from the movies,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   which is, of course, as with most things
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   it does inaccurate, and it really doesn't
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   make it that much quieter.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It doesn't make you able to sneak around
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and shoot stuff without anybody hearing,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   but it does protect your hearing as a shooter,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and it also, they like to say,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   it's respectful to your neighbors
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   if you happen to be in a place where you can shoot.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   But anyway, if you are going to add a suppressor,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   then that starts to make the weapon much longer,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   so then you may go to a shorter barrel
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   just to compensate for that,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and that's where something like what Joshua mentioned
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   about the .300 Blackout, that was designed for that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   So once you dig into it, you may find yourself,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   you know, going a little deeper into it
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and finding out some of the pretty neat stuff
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   that can be done with the alternatives
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   to the original setup.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   - So let's get to practical advice,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   because obviously I want to give you practical advice.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I don't want to just, you can become an enthusiast
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and do all that if you're interested,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   but the practical advice is, number one,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   go and get one.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's hard for me to imagine it being
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   a bad financial decision to buy an AR-15.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   They are very much demonized.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   They're very much, many people would like to legislate them.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   If they did legislate them, then the value would go up.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   An AR-15 that's not destroyed, not overused,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   has a very high value in the secondary market.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   If you ever need to sell it,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   you can sell it very, very quickly.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And if you need to upgrade it, it can be a good decision.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   So can you imagine a scenario in which
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   you wind up financially poor with an AR?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   - Yeah, most people who own these things
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   have no intention of ever selling them.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   But no, I just, I mean, they're so cheap today
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   that there's just absolutely no way that,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   you know, maybe with 3D printing someday,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   that they'll get the production costs so low
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   that it'll go down by $10.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   But that's not what we're talking about.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And it's much more likely,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   if you survey the political landscape,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   it's much more likely that there's gonna be
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   more restrictions in the future than less.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And even if there are less,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   it's not really gonna change the value.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   And so in many ways, you can look at this
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   as simply future-proofing yourself.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And that is the beauty of this thing
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   where you can just buy that lower receiver.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   You may not wanna shoot right now.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   You may not wanna get into guns.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   You may not wanna do anything
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   except not have to worry about such things in the future.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   In which case, you can go buy these lower receivers.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   You can put them wherever you want.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   You frankly don't even have to lock 'em up in a safe.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   No kid is gonna do any, get in trouble with them.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   There's no way to shoot a bullet
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   out of an AR-15 lower receiver.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's just a piece of metal, and that's it.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   So you may just wanna go buy some of these
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   and stick 'em in a box in a closet,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   forget about them for the rest of your life.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But if you, you know, are worried at all
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   about the future trajectory of the political elements
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and the legislation and everything else,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   you may very well be happy in the future
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that you have that, or you may be very happy
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   that you can pass it on to your children.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And frankly, like I said, this is aluminum.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   You know, you don't even have to worry about it rusting.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   So if all you did was stick these things in a box
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and pass it on to your children's children,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   it would still be just as usable, you know,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   100 years from now.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And you don't even have to worry about
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   the prospect of having to do it yourself.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   There are plenty of people you could find
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   who for a small fee would be happy
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   to build it on there for you.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   - Right. And once you own that,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and especially, that's why I talk about
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   the value in the secondary market,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   the ability to make a private party sale,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   a private sale of a firearm between individuals,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   and of course this is frequently debated
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   in the political sphere under the so-called
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   gun show loophole.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   There is no gun show loophole.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   There is the ability for any private individual
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   to sell their property to another private individual.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   - Subject to state regulation.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Some states are more strict than that on that.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   - Right. So, the point is that once you have something,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   you can sell it in the private market.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And if you ever have the opportunity to buy a gun
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   in the private market versus having to complete
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   all of the federal paperwork,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   always choose the private market
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   because it brings you additional protection.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's a more valuable thing to you.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Now, the law is very clear that
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   the federal government is not allowed
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   to build and maintain registries and databases.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   However, I think most of us have a healthy distrust
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   of even any direction in that area,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and especially many gun owners have a healthy distrust.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   So, if you have them and you own them,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and if you buy them in the private market,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   then there is no record of your ownership
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   in the federal lists of paperwork.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   You can explore the details of how that works.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's a fascinating system.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I appreciate the protections that have been put in place,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   but to the point, by owning those lowers,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   you are protecting yourself in many ways.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Now, that doesn't mean that legislation cannot change.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   For example, California has all of these restrictions
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   at present on what you're technically legally allowed to own.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You are a felon.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   You are a convicted felon, but you could be charged
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   if you own a standard capacity magazine
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   in the state of California.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   There's this whole recent debacle with this new law.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I won't go into California.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But the reality is that in California, in Colorado,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   in New York, in Connecticut, nobody turns them in
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   when they change the law.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I read a story, was it Connecticut,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   where they were doing research on registries,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and they found that 62% of police officers in the state
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   had unregistered guns, even after they were supposed to all register.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   So there is widespread civil disobedience among gun owners
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   in the United States of America, and it's fantastic to see,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   especially to see multiple police sheriffs are suing
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   their state governments for the overreach,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   and I'm getting into a ditch.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   At this point, there are still plenty of law enforcement people
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   who say they would not enforce certain restrictions, but...
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Exactly. Times can change.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So you could buy a lower.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   You can also just go and buy a completed gun,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   and that's what you probably should do if you are a new gun owner,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   in my opinion.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Just go and buy a completed gun.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Now, there is a kind of a halfway point.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   You could buy a completed upper and a completed lower,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and you could do that as well,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and that's probably one of your best deals in the current market.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Right. I checked the prices today,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and the lowers are still available for $40 to $50,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and again, if you actually have zero interest in actually having a working gun
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   or shooting it or having to lock it up somehow,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   then that may be the easiest solution.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And that's probably the best investment opportunity.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Right. Sure.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   If you wanted it from the investment perspective,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   because that lower is so valuable, especially if there were legal changes.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Sure. Exactly.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   So going beyond that, if you want to actually have a functional firearm,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   then there's the separating the lower and the upper, like I mentioned before.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   The lower can be a little bit--has a lot more pieces and parts.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I actually haven't done it myself yet.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I've just watched the videos on how to do it.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   They're all over YouTube.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   If you're curious about that, it's very easy to find,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   and you can watch the--you know, basically,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   somebody knows what they're doing, can be done with it in 20 minutes or less.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   So, you know, they can make a video, a pretty short video,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   showing you how it's done and get a sense of it.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   The upper actually has much less assembly involved,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   maybe in terms of tools, maybe a little more.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   But the point is that you can do everything from nothing but parts.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   You can get an assembled upper and do the lower yourself,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   or you can do the lower yourself and buy the other way,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   or you can just buy a fully assembled lower and a fully assembled upper.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And that can be the easiest solution while keeping the cost low.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   You're not really putting a name brand on there.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   You know, there are companies that have established a brand.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I mean, the market in terms of gun manufacturing themselves
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   is very clogged right now.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   The market just exploded after the ban expired,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and I'm sure there are hundreds of AR-15 manufacturers
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   to the point where they're going out of business right now
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   because of the softening of the market after Trump was elected.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   So you may find a deal on a name brand thing,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   but they're still going to be more expensive.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I think the entry level, for example, you walk into a gun store,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Smith & Wesson, you'll probably find those $500 or so,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   and those are pretty acceptable quality.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Let me just say one thing, though, on this,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   because we talked a lot about building yourself and everything else.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Again, going back to application, if it's a--
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   and the obsessive nature of the conversation.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   If you are a soldier or a police officer or anything else
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   where there are critical applications,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and there can't be any question about the reliability of your gun,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   whether it's going to do what you need it to do,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   usually the easy button is to go to a respected manufacturer
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   and manufacturers may offer warranties and all that stuff.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   There's all the support that a manufacturer can give.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   If you are a hard user, for example, the enthusiasts,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   there are plenty of enthusiasts that will run through thousands
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   of rounds in their guns in a month.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And if you're a hard user, these are mechanical devices,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   and they can wear out, and there is a mil spec,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and so if a company is trying to sell you a more expensive gun,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   they're going to tell you about how they're going beyond
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   the military specification to make it better.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   So if that's your world, you probably don't need my advice,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   but you may spend more money for a name-brand product
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   or there are improvements to design for things like--
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   there are variations, for example, one of the common ones is piston design
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   that you'll see that label, and that's basically lets it run longer
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   without being cleaned reliably and stuff like that.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   If that's what you're doing, you'll probably figure this all out pretty quick.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   But if you're just a normal person who doesn't go shooting a lot,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   maybe you take it to the range to get familiar with it,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   have a little fun every once in a while, but that's it,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   I would say an entry-level gun is probably going to be sufficient
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   as long as you verify that it works well.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   There are guns you can buy for the cheapest price possible
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and then they just don't work right. That does happen.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   But if you think about something that even you are going to rely on
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   for self-defense, what do you need it to do?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   You don't need it to work for hundreds of rounds,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   you don't need it to run a thousand rounds without a single malfunction.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   You need it probably to shoot five bullets or so, or maybe ten,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   or maybe a full 30-round magazine.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   As long as you're confident to do that, you're going to be okay
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   and you're never going to have a problem.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Well, you know, personal opinion, opinions vary on this,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   but personal opinion, if you test it, let's say 500 rounds without problems,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   you probably achieve what you need to achieve.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   So, if you walk into, for example, if you walk into a gun store
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and you start letting them chat you up, they may want to tell you
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   all about the superior aspects of a certain gun that costs
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   two or three hundred more than the one next to it,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and they may tell you all about a cold hammer-forged barrel, or whatever.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Well, it is better quality, but you may not care.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   That may not be relevant to your use.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   So, don't get too caught up in that, don't let them talk you
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   into all this business of quality.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   A mil-spec AR-15 is a mil-spec AR-15.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   It's everything that you need it to be for basic use,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   especially for recreational use.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And you may find after you get the cheap one, you may figure out
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   a lot better what you want to spend more money on later.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   But don't let anybody talk you into buying the expensive stuff,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   especially if it's your first gun or your first rifle.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   So, all that being said, you know, prices today, you can get
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   a fully assembled lower around 150, you can get a fully assembled upper
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   around 300, or even less if it's on sale, and basically, you know,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   the lower goes to your dealer, pay a fee to transfer that,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   the upper comes to you in the mail, you put those together
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   and you've got yourself a fully assembled gun under 500, I'd say.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So, here's my issue with gun people.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   It's so easy for gun people to get interested in all those details.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   "Oh, I've got this trigger, I've got this chrome moly blah blah blah barrel."
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   If you've got a budget of $1,000, instead of doing what most people do,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   which is spend $950 on the gun, and then they have $50 of ammo
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   to go to the range one time, spend $500 on the gun,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   spend $200 on magazines, buy 20 magazines for the thing,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   because if you ever had to use the gun--we're not talking home defense,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   here I'm just talking about the fact of having a rifle--
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   if you ever had to go to war, which I pray you never do,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and I pray I never do, I'd rather have 20 magazines than two.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   The magazines are the weak link, if you don't have those, or if they break.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   The gun is probably not going to break, you can buy a part set.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   But the big thing is buy ammo, and buy training, and buy range time.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Those are the things that people miss.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   They don't buy ammo, they don't buy training, and they don't buy range time.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   And because of that, they aren't effective with their weapons.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Right, and that's really--the one thing I haven't mentioned at all is accessories,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   but they are pretty essential, and there's a big difference
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   between people who buy guns just because they want to buy them,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   and people who actually buy them because they want to use them for whatever use.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   If you're going to use a gun, you're going to need some accessories on there,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   at least minimum sights, most likely you're going to want some kind of red dot,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   which vary greatly in price, I mean, maybe $50 up to $600 or whatever.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   A red dot is a sighting mechanism that puts a hologram of a red dot on your target,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   and it's special because it provides fast target acquisition,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   allows you to bring the rifle up and quickly understand where it's aiming,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and it's easy to see.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   So it's a very effective way for you to quickly get the rifle on target
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   much faster than iron sights, the traditional iron sights.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Right, it's a much more useful thing.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   I mean, basically it's to the point where a lot of people don't even bother
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   putting the regular old sights on the rifle anymore because they never use them.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Including, by the way, military special ops guys.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   A lot of those guys don't even bother because their optics are so reliable.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Even as backups?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Yeah, they never use them, they don't even care.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   But anyway, you could easily, without even buying high-end accessories,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   you could easily spend as much on accessories as you spend on the rifle itself.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And that's not even getting to what Josh was talking about,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   which is a very important point.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Oh, one more mention on the accessories.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   The sights, you probably eventually would want some kind of optic,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   some kind of sling, and then if you want to be able to use this thing
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   more than 12 hours out of each day, you need some kind of flashlight on there.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Very quickly it adds up.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And that's all before you get into the very important element of training,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   which a weekend class is going to cost you probably at least $200 to $300,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   but it's very important, very essential.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And ammunition can get expensive.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Right now--I didn't check today, but let's just say in the vicinity of
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   $20-something to $0.30 a round, maybe to $40 maybe.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   More than that.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Sorry, that's old prices. I'm thinking 9mm.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   A thousand-round box of 5.56 is not cheap.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Right, you're looking around $0.50 a round,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and you can run through some money very quickly just doing some basic training.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   So personally, my perspective is I'm very passionate about the high-quality stuff,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   but if you're getting practical, your money is much better spent
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   on things like decent accessories, training, practice,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   than on a more expensive gun.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   So a thousand-round bulk purchase of ammo if you buy just online
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and you're not going to a local gun store,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   probably under $350, but $300 to $350 for a thousand rounds of 5.56.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   So that's not cheap, but you can blow through some money
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   because you go to a class, a good weekend class,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   they usually tell you to bring a thousand rounds.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Yeah, you're at least going to use 500.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Right, so ammo adds up.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   But the whole point of having the gun,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   if you're not just doing it as an investment--and again, that's where different things--
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   but the whole point is to be able to effectively use it.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   As the old saying goes, "I have a lot more fear of a man with one gun
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   who knows how to use it than a man with a closet full that doesn't know how to shoot."
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   And again, going back to the distinction,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   there are a lot of people who just buy these things
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   either because they want to protect themselves in the future
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   or just because they think it's cool.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   But if you open up most gun safes,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   very few of the guns inside are actually ready to use.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You're welcome to collect guns, but just don't fool yourself
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   by thinking that once you buy the gun, you're done.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   You're just getting started.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   It doesn't make you invincible.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   That's the whole point which bugs me.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   People say, "Oh, the person has an AR-15."
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Watching the news over the last week,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   somehow I've seen advance on cable news that
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   because an AR-15 is a rifle and advances and sends a round downrange
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   at a higher velocity than a handgun,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   that a police officer with a handgun is somehow unable to go up against an AR-15.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It just boggles the mind that these people are allowed to talk in public
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   on this subject that they don't know about.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   An AR-15, there are a lot of ways to mess the thing up
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   if you don't know how to use it.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   You can have malfunctions, and I'm trying to keep this simple and avoid politics.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   It's a touchy week for us.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Basic accessories are, as you said,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   you got to make sure that you budget for sights.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   You can get cheap $20 strap-on, screw-on iron sights,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   and the gun may come with it.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   But you want to budget for a sighting mechanism.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   You want to budget for a sling.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   I think you want to budget for accessories
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   because when you're out actually shooting it,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   most people, you go out on Sunday afternoon,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   you take it and load up a few magazines of ammo,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   put them on the table, you hand the gun around,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   let everyone shoot a couple of magazines, and that's about it.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   But if you're really going to use it,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   you need to plan for having the accessories that are going to be useful.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   So budget for the accessories, as always, and learn to shoot effectively.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   What did I miss?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   You have a good starter?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Trying to keep it practical. That's it.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   We could talk the political angle all day.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Now, go to YouTube.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And that's the other thing that's just wonderful about YouTube
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   is there is so much great training available on YouTube.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   There are qualified firearms trainers right now
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   that put out information on YouTube,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   put out basically whole classes.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   If you want to learn how to build one, go to YouTube.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   You can run the video,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   and you can put the pieces together at your kitchen table.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   If you want to learn the techniques of shooting,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   if you want to have reviews, just go to YouTube.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   YouTube has been a wonderful source of information
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   to allow enthusiasts to reach a wide audience
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   with their specialized information.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Yeah, and so just to come back to where we started in summary,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   the AR-15 may not be the best rifle today
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   in whatever criteria you're looking at,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   but it is probably the one that everybody should own
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   before they buy any others.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   And this debate rages across the Internet,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   forums, it just--it never ends.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And manufacturers are constantly coming out with new designs
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   and basically everything is about--
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   the constant theme is how do we take the best elements
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   of the AK and the AR and put them together in one gun?
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And there are some very well-done attempts at that.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And frankly, I'd like to buy them all.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   But, you know, if you're going to be practical
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   and you don't have a lot of money,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   don't get distracted by all that stuff.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Focus on the basics and then be very careful
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   because the bug may bite you,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   and when it bites you, it never lets go.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So, you know, this hobby can become a money pit very easily.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   But, you know, we could talk a lot about what's better out there,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   but that's not the point.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   The point is what should you get,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and if you put it all together, add it all up,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   if nothing else, if nothing else,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   the fact that it is such a widespread ownership,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   you know, millions and millions that are owned,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   the industry to support it is so big,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   the compatibility, interchangeability of the parts
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   is just so universal that, you know,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   there is probably no other place to start.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   And then once you start there,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   then you look at your specific desires or needs
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   and decide what fits those.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   But it doesn't get any easier than this one, if you ask me.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   Yeah. If you are wondering why the AR-15 is so popular,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   it's not because people who want to own an AR...
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   It's not because AR-15 owners want to have blood on their hands
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   and worship at the altar of thinking they're Rambo
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   killing innocent people.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Yeah, pretending to be soldiers.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   It's stupid.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Of course there are idiots out there who probably do want war.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   There are idiots out there that want the world to fall apart
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   so they can strap on their plate carrier
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   and their mag pouches and go to war.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Of course there are. There are always idiots.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   When you have millions of people living together,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   you always have a small fraction that are idiots.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   But the millions and millions of people that own an AR
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   do it for the same reason that millions and millions of people
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   own a Toyota Camry or a Toyota Tacoma
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   or a Chevy pickup truck,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   that there is a usefulness with it,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   with the ubiquity, with the practicability,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   with the fact that one firearm can do so many things decently.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   The AR is not the best in the world at any one thing.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I can't think of any one actual shooting application
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   in which the AR-15 is the ultimate tool,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   other than the fact that it could be modified and adjusted
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   to fit different applications.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   If you want to shoot long distance,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   a $300 hunting rifle can get you out to 700 yards,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   where an AR-15 can never get you to.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   It can get you there, but it's not easy.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   You think you can get an AR to 700 yards?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Oh yeah, they do it all the time.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   You can get them to 1,000 yards, no problem.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   But you've got to know what you're doing.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   What's the terminal velocity of the bullet?
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Not much.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   It bounces off your cheek.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   Moving pretty slow.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Okay. So forgive me, but the point is that
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   if you want to do long-range shooting,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   you can get better guns to do long-range shooting.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   If you want to kill somebody more effectively,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   you get a bigger gun.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Yeah, get a shotgun at close range.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Nothing beats that.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   You will kill somebody with a shotgun
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   with double-op buck at close range,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   or a .308 that'll go through somebody.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   If you want a gun that's easier to shoot, that's cheaper,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   there are options that fill all those things better than an AR,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   but there's nothing that does pretty good
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   at just about all those things better than an AR,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   and that's why it's so popular.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Yep. I'll admit that when I first got into this,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   I was interested in everything but ARs.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   I thought that was old news,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   and then I completely turned around.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   So you keep talking about technology.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Last question for you.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   You keep talking about technology.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   What is the future?
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   The military is very conflicted on that.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   There's a lot of stops and starts in their efforts
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   to find the next generation of weapons,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   and there's talk about things like caseless ammunition.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   There's things like that,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   but honestly there's nothing on the horizon
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   that's really obviously going to replace this stuff.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   So what they keep coming back to is just modifications,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   but it's the same basic concept.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   In the civilian world, I don't see anything else.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Again, if your intention is to have a gun
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   that does certain things better, there are options out there.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Unfortunately, they cost a lot of money.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   All the guns that I want to buy are over $2,000.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I was going to say, for me, the bullpup,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   all of the cool new bullpup designs.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Yeah. My current obsession--
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Explain what a bullpup is.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   A bullpup is quickly--
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   it takes the action of the gun,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   where it actually loads and ejects the rounds.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   The chamber.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Okay. Yeah, it takes the chamber,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   and it moves it from in front of the grip
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   to behind the grip.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   So essentially what that means is that
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   for the same barrel length,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   it cuts about 10 inches off the overall length of the weapon.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Makes it more compact, moves the weight back,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   makes it easier to hold up on your shoulder.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Just frankly better in many ways in terms of using the gun.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Unfortunately, because of the smaller market
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   and maybe other factors in the manufacturing process,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   it's still pretty expensive.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I'm not sure if you can get much below--
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   I don't know, definitely over $1,000,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   and some of the nicer ones are closer to $2,000.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   But that may be the future.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Next generation is more emphasis on that
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   because there are a lot of benefits
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   when you're talking about tactical applications.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   But I don't see groundbreaking technology.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Perhaps in the manufacturing process,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   there'll be some improvements.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   But I don't see it yet.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Well, hopefully we've given you just something--
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   it's hard to go wrong in the AR marketplace,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   especially if you go purchase from a known quantity
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   or a known manufacturer.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   You can--just about any brand that you recognize,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   you're going to be fine.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   And it is a really, really valuable platform.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   One quick thing on the pricing,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   because I probably didn't make it clear.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   You can buy an entry-level complete rifle
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   for probably $500, maybe a little less, a little more.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But if you want something with a little bit better features,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   then you can get the same price with better features
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   by assembling the uppers and lowers.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   One of the common websites-- did we mention the website?
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Sure.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   All right, Palmetto State Armory is the big player in that game.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   And you can go to their website, and you
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   can get any variation you want.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   But they often have daily sales on these assembled uppers
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   and assembled lowers.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   You don't have to buy them at the same time.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   You can wait for the deal on the one you want.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   But what you'll find very quickly is that the cheapest
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   assembled guns, they generally limit
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   your ability to accessorize.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   So the big thing, for example, is the handguard.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   You get these cheap plastic handguards,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   the brown things that look like they're still in Vietnam.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   And you can't really mount anything on those
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   very easily, whereas an upgraded handguard, if you do it
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   yourself, it'll cost some money.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   But when you get it assembled from PSA,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   it's about the same price.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Other elements, like the stock, a nicer stock,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   or-- that's probably the big ones,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   the handguard and the stock-- or even the barrel quality.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Actually, I like the idea of stainless steel barrels,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   so I don't have to worry too much about rust.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   You may get a better barrel for the same price.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   So I'm not sure how you can get below that $450 to $500
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   mark with a complete rifle, but without building it yourself.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   And you probably don't want to save that much,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   but you can get more for your money by going that route,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   you know, separate the upper from the lower.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   So that's my recommendation.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Check out Palmer's Armor.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   And the biggest thing I would say,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   if you're not familiar with it, just ask around.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Find a buddy who has one and go shoot it.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   And get over the fear of it, and then ask them for advice.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Go to a gun show.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   If you go to a gun show, go to a gun shop.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Go to a local gun shop.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   That's what they're there for, is to help you
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   with those decisions.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   You're not going to be Rambo.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   You're going to be owning a quality and useful,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   very versatile rifle, which, hey, as an American,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   you should.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   You've honored me with your time and attention,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   with some ideas and strategies and tactics and techniques
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   in today's show, make a plan to take action on it.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   in and of itself, doesn't automatically lead
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   to a life change.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   So take action.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   Two, take something that was helpful to you
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   that you care about.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   in helping me to propagate the message
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   That helps the person that you are engaging with,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   and it also helps you because teaching others
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   is one of the most effective ways for you to learn
