[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   Today we say farewell to our friend,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.260]   pastor and author, Tim Keller.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480]   Tim passed away in New York City at the age of 72.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.540]   He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2020.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.800]   Over the years, Dr. Keller graciously appeared
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.120]   as a guest on this podcast,
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.920]   leaving us with nine rich APJ episodes
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640]   on topics like vocation or work,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240]   and on the themes of prayer and solitude.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360]   I'm thankful for the time that he invested with us.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.720]   Cancer for Dr. Keller was an old nemesis.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.480]   Back in 2002, he was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.000]   a battle he would fight between 2003 and 2004.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   God would heal and restore Keller,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.400]   but not before thyroid surgery
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.520]   knocked him out of the pulpit for three months.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.900]   A decade later, Keller preached a sermon
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.960]   on boldness in the face of death,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.560]   and recounted what he learned
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.520]   during that first cancer battle,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400]   opening up about his fears
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.120]   as he was rolled into the operating room.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.960]   In that moment, he caught a glimpse
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   of something other worldly.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   He saw the sheer magnitude of God's glory and God's joy
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.600]   beyond this world of pain and suffering
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.720]   and cancer and death.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.160]   I wanna play for you a sermon clip that comes to my mind
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.400]   on this day celebrating his life,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.920]   knowing that he has passed into the presence of God
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   and into God's incredible, unspeakable joy
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.560]   that the rest of us are left longing for.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.440]   Here's Tim Keller in 2013, answering the question,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.020]   where do we find courage for life's scariest moments?
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.720]   - To me, my favorite version of this,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   of this example of what real courage is
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.680]   comes out of this little passage
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.760]   near the end of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320]   It's a place where Sam,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.080]   but if you're one of the three or four people in the world
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.480]   never heard of Lord of the Rings, it's a story.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.600]   And there's these two little heroes,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.080]   and one is the master, one is the servant of the master.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.640]   Sam is the servant, and he loves his master.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.200]   And they're on this terrible quest,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   and at one point, his master is imprisoned in a tower.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160]   Sam rescues Frodo, his master,
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.080]   largely by screwing himself up and saying,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.720]   you are not going to hurt him, I'm gonna do this,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.800]   and you can't stop me, I'm the great one, here I come.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.920]   And he does rescue him.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.320]   Now, after that, they're still on their terrible quest,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   and the danger is still very real.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   One night, Sam looks up into the sky, and he sees a star,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.520]   and this is in the book, not the movie.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.400]   And this is what the passage says.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.160]   It says, "He saw a white star twinkle for a while.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.880]   "The beauty of it smote his heart,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.640]   "for like a shaft clear and cold,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.120]   "the thought pierced him that in the end,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.480]   "the shadow was only a small and passing thing.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.600]   "There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.800]   "His song in the tower had been defiance rather than hope,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.320]   "for he was thinking of himself.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.480]   "Now, his own sake, and even his master,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.460]   "ceased to trouble him,
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.200]   "and he fell into a deep, untroubled sleep."
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.860]   See, the author, Tolkien, is trying to say
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.080]   there's a difference between defiance,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.200]   which you screw yourself up, I can do it,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.640]   that's still, in the end, not the courage you need
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.400]   because you're looking at yourself.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.060]   Courage, on the one hand, is not looking at yourself
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.480]   and banishing fear, no, it's just letting the fears
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.220]   play their role, and not letting the fears
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.760]   play too much of a role by looking away from yourself.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.360]   Okay, you say, but then to what?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's even in the text that I just read.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.440]   It was defiance, not hope, hope.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.280]   "When Paul met Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.660]   "'Who are you, Lord?' he said, I asked.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.320]   "'I am Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you're persecuting.'
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   "Resurrected Jesus."
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.000]   Now, when we were going through Acts 9,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   the first account of Jesus, of Paul's conversion,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.280]   we talked a little bit about this.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   When Paul realized that Jesus had been resurrected
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.000]   from the dead, suddenly everything broke open.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.960]   Suddenly the meaning of his death made sense,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.240]   and hope for the future made sense.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.560]   Because if Jesus Christ really died on the cross,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.160]   taking our punishment, and he's now raised from the dead,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.880]   now when we believe in him, not only is our sins forgiven,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.780]   but now we have incredible hope about the future.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.560]   We're gonna be raised, and everything in this world
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.760]   is gonna be put right.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.440]   And there's not gonna be any suffering or death.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   That is an astonishing hope.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   Now, as I said, the first part of courage
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.640]   is looking away from yourself.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.800]   The world tells you, look at yourself and banish fear.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.920]   Okay, secondly, the second part of courage
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.640]   is looking toward hope, getting a hope.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.740]   Real courage is not the absence of fear,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.400]   it's the presence of joy.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   So much joy that the fear plays its proper role.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.960]   Well, how do you get that joy?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.520]   Well, before we get that joy, let me just tell you
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   that there is, I'd say, a second way out there in the world
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   that people are counseling each other to get courage.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.180]   I think the primary way is this sort of self-esteemism.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.960]   The primary way that the world tries to tell you
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.240]   to get courage is just tell yourself, no fear,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.040]   you can do it, summons up the blood, and go do it.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.960]   I do think that there's an alternate discourse out there,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.680]   and it's older, it's more ancient.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.960]   It goes back to the East, it goes back to the Greeks.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.640]   Cicero, for example, who was one of the Greek,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.600]   Greek Roman Stoics, actually, Cicero wrote a very famous
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.800]   couple of treatises on why you shouldn't be afraid
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   of anything, especially not death.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   You shouldn't be afraid of death, and here's what he says.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.720]   He says, "Courage makes light of death,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   "for the dead are only as they were before they were born.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.200]   "It encounters pain by recollecting that the great pains
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.080]   "are ended by death.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.800]   "Others we can usually control if they're endurable,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.480]   "but if they're not, we may serenely quit life's theater
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.680]   "when the play has ceased to please us."
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.400]   Now, what he's saying here is, he says,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.920]   "There is no reason to be afraid of anything,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.080]   "including not of death."
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.920]   Why?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   Because when you die, that's it.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.440]   It's like before, you're just not there.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.480]   Huh.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.760]   And so, what is he saying?
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   You shouldn't be afraid of anything,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.840]   because you tell yourself, I'm gonna lose it all anyway.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   No use crying over spilled milk.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.880]   When you die, that's it.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.320]   You know, I'm enjoying things, but everybody loses things.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.280]   What are they doing?
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.520]   You're still deadening your heart, aren't you?
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.880]   You're still deadening, there's a way of getting courage.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.560]   Not by deadening your heart to fear,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.480]   but by deadening your heart to love.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   Because when Cicero says, and it's not just Cicero,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   I've read it in the New Yorker, I've read it,
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.040]   so many smart, secular people today say the same thing.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.280]   There's no reason to be afraid of things,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.760]   no reason to be afraid of death.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.960]   When you're dead, that's it.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.480]   You know, there's no reason to be afraid of death.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.320]   Oh, no?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.640]   What is it that makes your life meaningful?
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.000]   Is it your health?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.840]   Partly.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.960]   Is it your wealth?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   Partly.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   Is it your success?
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.480]   Partly.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   But what if you had those things and you didn't have love?
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   What if you had nobody in your life to love you?
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.520]   Nobody in your life for you to love?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.680]   It would be meaningless.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.200]   What makes your life meaningful
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.920]   is people that you love and people that love you.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.360]   That's what makes your life meaningful.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.240]   And now you're gonna stand there, Cicero, or whoever,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.960]   and you're gonna tell me I should not fear a future state
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.560]   in which the one thing that makes life meaningful
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.440]   is taken away.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.480]   All love and all loved ones are taken away.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.360]   That's the state.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.640]   And you're telling me I shouldn't be afraid of that?
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.280]   Crazy?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.200]   Of course we should be afraid of that.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.640]   I'm sorry, deadening your heart to love
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.080]   is just like deadening your heart to fear.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.560]   It kind of works partly, but I don't know.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.120]   It's certainly not good for your heart.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.760]   Here's a better way.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.880]   Here's a better way.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.800]   George Herbert, 17th century Anglican priest,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.520]   incredible poet.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.720]   One of my favorite poems in the history of the world
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.680]   is his little poem called "Dialogue Anthem."
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.160]   It's a dialogue between a Christian and death.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.760]   I'm gonna read the whole thing through.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.560]   It won't be that hard to tell when Christian's talking,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.600]   when death is talking, 'cause when I'm death, I'll frown.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   Here's the Christian, it starts.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.400]   Alas, poor death, where is thy glory?
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.760]   Where is thy famous force, thy ancient sting?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.320]   Alas, poor mortal, void of story.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.800]   Go and read how I killed your king.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.560]   Poor death, and who was hurt thereby?
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.040]   Thy curse being laid on him makes thee accursed.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.520]   Let losers talk, yet thou shalt die.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.760]   These arms will crush thee.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.840]   And the Christian responds, this is the last part.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.440]   Spare not, do thy worst.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.880]   You shall only make me one day better than before.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   Thou so much worse that thou shalt be no more.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.840]   Okay, you wanna be fearless?
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.520]   Well, you wanna look out there and say,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.880]   nothing can really hurt me because of my hope,
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.960]   because of my infallible hope.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.840]   You wanna look out there saying,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.240]   even the worst thing that can happen to me,
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.840]   death, can only make me better?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.920]   Spare not, death.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.440]   Come, come on.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.120]   All you could do is make me better than I am now.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.880]   George Herbert has a great line where he says,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.200]   death used to be an executioner,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.280]   but the gospel makes him just a gardener.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   All it can do is plant you,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.080]   and you finally come up into the beautiful flower
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.920]   that you were meant to be.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.200]   You're just a seed and death all just plants you,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.800]   and then you finally become who you were meant to be.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.120]   That's not courage, the Ciceronian way.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.160]   Just kill your heart.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   Just say, you know, well,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.600]   we're gonna lose everything anyway.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.440]   Just deaden it.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.840]   That's not the Cicero.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.400]   This isn't Hercules.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.680]   This isn't King Arthur.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.960]   This is Jesus.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.080]   'Cause how can you know?
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.040]   How can you be utterly, utterly sure
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.520]   that you've got that hope?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.360]   How can you say to even death itself,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.080]   spare not do thy worst?
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.320]   I can tell you how.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.400]   You have to believe in the only God.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.640]   There's a lot of religions out there,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.840]   and they all claim God, God, God,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.360]   but the only God who has as one of his attributes courage.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.120]   Christianity is the only religion that even claims
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.680]   that our God has the attribute of courage.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.520]   Why?
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.800]   Because when God became Jesus Christ,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.960]   he became vulnerable.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   But he became human.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.080]   And when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.680]   when everybody was asleep,
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.800]   and it was dark, and there was nobody there,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.880]   and he realized what he was about to face.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.680]   I actually think the Garden of Gethsemane is the place
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.120]   where you see the greatest act of courage
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.960]   in the history of the world,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.640]   because by the time he got nailed to the cross,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.560]   you know, even if he wanted to turn around,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.520]   it would have been too late.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.320]   There he was, nailed to the cross.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.720]   But that night, he could have left.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.480]   In fact, he even thought about it.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.240]   He says, "My soul is overwhelmed to the point of death."
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.640]   What do you see in Jesus Christ?
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.920]   Do you see courage?
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.960]   You don't see him saying, "Bring it on."
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   The bloody sweat showed he was feeling fear.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.880]   He wasn't saying, "Come on."
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.920]   What was he doing?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.640]   Here's what he was doing.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.400]   "We're told all about it in Hebrews 12.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.480]   "Therefore, let us run with perseverance
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.080]   "the race marked out for us.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.520]   "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.920]   "the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.120]   "who for the joy set before him
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.480]   "endured the cross, scorning its shame,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.160]   "and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   "Consider him who endured such opposition,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.080]   "so you will not lose heart."
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.840]   There it is.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.080]   What was, he looked away from himself.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   And what did he look toward?
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.920]   Joy.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.120]   What was the joy?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.080]   The joy of pleasing his father and redeeming his friends.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.160]   The joy of pleasing his father and redeeming his friends.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.880]   The joy of that enabled him to have courage.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Listen, if you see him courageously dying for you like that
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.000]   so that you can say to death, "Spare not do thy worst,"
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.200]   then you can have courage.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.760]   One of the few times I needed courage,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.360]   God was very happy to give it to me,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.200]   and that was very nice.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.680]   When I was going under, being wheeled in
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.040]   for my only cancer surgery, I had thyroid cancer years ago,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.680]   and I do remember it was so nice.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.840]   I had a sense as I was going in
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.720]   that I suddenly had this sense that,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.280]   you know, the world is wonderful,
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.920]   and there's just this little,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.720]   the universe is this big ball of the glory of God,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.680]   and we're just trapped in this little tiny,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.040]   I remember it very clearly,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.560]   we're trapped in this little tiny speck of darkness,
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.520]   and even that's gonna be taken away eventually.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.840]   And therefore, no matter what happens now,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.280]   whatever happens with the surgery,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.000]   I'm gonna be all right, my family's gonna be all right,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.080]   the world's gonna be all right,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.120]   everything's gonna be all right.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.760]   It was very nice to have a moment of courage.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.800]   Now, I have to tell you, I haven't had many of those moments.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.520]   I can't hold onto them, but guess what?
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.000]   The courageous Jesus Christ holds onto me
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   and holds onto you, and if you look at him
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.760]   until the joy of his courageous,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.920]   of what he accomplished through his courageous act,
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.720]   by looking at the joy of what is now there for you,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   you'll face whatever you have to face.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.040]   - Real courage is not the absence of fear,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.000]   it's the presence of joy.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.040]   A moving testimony of the sheer magnitude of God's glory,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.240]   a clip from Tim Keller's sermon titled
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   "The Gospel and Courage," preached on May 26, 2013.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.080]   Couple years later, Dr. Keller took this story
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.400]   and wrote it into his book, "Walking with God
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.360]   "Through Pain and Suffering."
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.720]   I wanna read his published version as well.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.040]   Quote, "There have not been many times in my life
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.240]   "when I felt the peace that passes understanding,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.960]   "but there was one time for which I'm very grateful.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.160]   "It was just before my cancer surgery.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.880]   "My thyroid was about to be removed,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.320]   "and after that, I faced a treatment
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.000]   "with a radioactive iodine to destroy
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.880]   "any residual cancerous thyroid issues in my body.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.240]   "Of course, my whole family and I were shaken by it all
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.960]   "and deeply anxious.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.160]   "On the morning of my surgery,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.360]   "after I said my goodbyes to my wife and sons,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.680]   "I was wheeled into a room to be prepped.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.800]   "And in the moments before they gave me
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.440]   "the anesthetic, I prayed.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.960]   "To my surprise, I got a sudden, clear,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.920]   "new perspective on everything.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.520]   "It seemed to me that the universe
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.120]   "was an enormous realm of joy, mirth, and high beauty.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.240]   "Of course it was.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.680]   "Didn't the triune God make it to be filled
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.200]   "with his own boundless joy, wisdom, love, and delight?
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   "And within this great globe of glory
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   "was only one little speck of darkness, our world,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.040]   "where there was temporarily pain and suffering.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.360]   "But it was only a speck.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.920]   "And soon that speck would fade away
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.520]   "and everything would be light.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.760]   "And I thought, it doesn't really matter
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   "how the surgery goes.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.280]   "Everything will be all right.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   "Me, my wife, my children, my church will all be all right.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:18.720]   "I went to sleep with a bright peace on my heart."
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.080]   End quote.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.360]   I trust in these last days, Tim was given this courage
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.400]   and this vision again of the magnitude of God's joy
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.360]   enveloping everything else.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.920]   Dr. Keller escaped this speck of darkness
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.640]   for the high beauty forever beyond the shadow's reach
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.040]   and entered into the boundless joy of his master
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.720]   at the age of 72.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   Farewell for now, Dr. Keller.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.920]   (upbeat music)
