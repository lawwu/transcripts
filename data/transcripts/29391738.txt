[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.700]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.880]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.720]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.680]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.120]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.320]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.040]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.300]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.440]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.880]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.580]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.920]   - Well, listeners, welcome to January.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960]   I mean, it seems to me to be easily
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.800]   the longest month in the calendar
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.820]   because for many of us,
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.920]   it's darker than usual and colder than usual,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.880]   and we've left behind the glory
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.320]   and the brightness of the holidays,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680]   and now we are back into it,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.680]   and it sometimes can look just like a slog ahead
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.380]   for as far as we can see, but I've got some news for you.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   There are some ways that we can define or redefine success,
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020]   some beautiful ways of looking at what the Lord has done
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.620]   in our family over the last fall
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.620]   and what he can do with us as spring approaches.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.860]   So I brought one of my best friends,
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.940]   one of my best classical educator friends
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.580]   to share with us today, Brittany Lewis is here with us.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.780]   Brittany, thank you so much for joining me.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.060]   - Oh, it is a joy.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.100]   I'm so glad to be here, thank you.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420]   - You are one that I think people will enjoy hearing
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.540]   your heart for homeschooling families
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.540]   and your experience with your own family.
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.340]   And then two, I just know
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640]   that you have a really encouraging spirit.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.360]   So I know that a lot of us need encouragement
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.220]   to be happy about January and to be happy
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820]   about starting the second semester.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.820]   So I wanna ask you first, what is usually harder for you
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.700]   or for your family, starting school in the fall
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.240]   or restarting in January?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.880]   - Definitely restarting in January.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.780]   - Yes, I think so many people have said that to me.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.980]   Why do you think, why is restarting so challenging?
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.540]   - I think it's human nature that we look
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.540]   at the long summer break and then we're all ready for fall
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.280]   and we have spent time refreshing ourselves
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.660]   and remembering why we do this and setting goals
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.960]   and the new books and the new supplies and the new goals
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.040]   and looking forward to all that we're going to learn.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.300]   And then by January, we've celebrated
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.920]   a shorter Christmas break in which,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.380]   especially as homeschooling parents,
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.800]   it wasn't possibly very restful because we were busy
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000]   with all the Christmas things.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   I know that that's true for me at my house.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.720]   And often we're delighted to have out-of-town guests
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.380]   for long periods of time.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720]   And then it's time to get the books out
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   and it's cold outside and we have to take
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.920]   the Christmas decorations down and just restarting
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.440]   can be a little harder just gaining momentum, I think.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.080]   But I think there's some things we can do
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.680]   that help us refocus and be grateful
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.480]   and treasure that time and look forward.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.440]   - That's really good.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.280]   There are things that we can do
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.400]   to make the atmosphere seem better.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.560]   We light more candles in January
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.220]   and we turn on the gas logs more in January.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.640]   I try to put around a lot of warm, snugly blankets
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.280]   in January just so that almost anywhere
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.760]   you would drop down to read or to rest or to study,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000]   there's a blanket at hand.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.320]   So yeah, I agree with you.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.480]   There are some things that we can do.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.740]   I know from experience, 'cause I homeschooled
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.840]   through a whole lot of Januarys too,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.480]   lots of us moms and dads try at least
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.040]   to spend some time over the break
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   or at least as January rolls around assessing the fall.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.580]   Do you do that routinely?
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.600]   Do you still do that?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.100]   Assess the fall as you're beginning in January?
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.140]   - I do.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.600]   I did that when my kids were in foundations
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.020]   and essentials too.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.640]   And now that I have the last of my three
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   is in challenge three and I spend some time
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720]   looking at her blue book and talking to her
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.200]   and she self-assesses and we kind of think together
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.640]   about progress, but I don't just do that for her.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.740]   I do that for myself as well as her teacher.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.740]   I think about how I did this past fall
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.280]   and what she needs and where she is.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.680]   And then I also think about other categories
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   than just academics.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.800]   - That's great.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.640]   That is great.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.720]   And I wanna talk to you about that in a few minutes
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   more deeply.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   What's the purpose of assessing the fall?
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.400]   So come January, 'cause okay, so some people say,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.760]   "Oh, I just wanna forget that."
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.040]   I mean, let's just start fresh.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.180]   We're starting new.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.260]   I'm gonna not look back.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.320]   I'm just gonna press ahead.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.760]   I'm gonna look forward.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   What's the purpose of looking back over the fall?
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.080]   - I think it's so that we can count what is good
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.480]   and give our students well done
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   and maybe ourselves a well done on certain things.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.920]   And then also set some reasonable goals
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.440]   to meet academic goals and other kinds of goals we have.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.620]   I think that's really important.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.640]   I also think it's hard for students to see their own progress
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.040]   so that if we can help them,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.960]   that can really encourage them too,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.880]   because they might feel like they just barely made it
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.560]   through the first semester
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.080]   and it might be harder for them to see progress.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.780]   - That's so wise.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.520]   - Yeah, well, I just think students aren't great
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.960]   at assessing themselves yet.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.060]   They're developing that.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.400]   And we spent a lot of time and challenge
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.800]   asking for self-assessment,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   but I think that can be part of the problem
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.700]   and an opportunity really to move forward in hope.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.940]   - That's really good.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.540]   I think that you're right, that our students are,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.020]   and sometimes it's because they are so close to the process,
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.780]   they don't see that they have grown,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.040]   that it takes them maybe less time
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.200]   or less mom involvement to complete a lesson
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.760]   or that they are asking better questions
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.840]   or they are choosing better descriptive words
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   or that they are not needing as much direction
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.140]   for the what do I do next moment every day.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.580]   So I think that's really wise
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.660]   that we take some assessment time
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.300]   to help our students see how far they've come.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.120]   So what kinds of things did you look at
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.280]   as you assessed the earlier part of the year?
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.000]   I like it that you said,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.060]   you looked back over for challenge students,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.680]   the blue books that you did or that they completed
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.360]   as part of their challenge communities.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.680]   What else did you look at as you assessed
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   and what was your main focus in assessing?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.240]   - I think I look at my original academic goals
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.640]   for the student and then I think about
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.140]   where they are in learning the skills of learning
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.740]   so that they're prepared to learn anything,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.680]   which CC does a really wonderful job
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.320]   of giving our students and ourselves those tools.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.600]   And then I think about their progress in a certain subject,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   especially those ones that are troubling,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.900]   but also the ones where I see they're excelling.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.180]   So I think about where they are in each of the subjects
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.940]   and where they are in the skills of learning.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.400]   And then I also think about spiritual goals
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.320]   and heart training type goals and family wins,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.940]   celebrations, things we don't wanna forget
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.800]   that sometimes just taking a few minutes
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.160]   to look back and go, why was that project so hard?
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.320]   Or why did we feel like we fell short in this paper?
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.960]   And then also look at the bigger picture of,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   oh, well, we were throwing a wedding at that time.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.080]   - Yes, oh my goodness. - Or we got ill at that time
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.800]   or we were serving someone at church at this time
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.360]   or this is what was happening in the student's life
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.200]   for my life.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   And I think that's really helpful to give us perspective.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.340]   - That is so wise.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.340]   I know so often when we do these mid-year assessments,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.040]   and I guess I can only speak for myself,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.340]   but I've talked to a lot of friends
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.560]   and a lot of other community members through the years,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.280]   I feel like so often we look at what fell short
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.000]   of our expectations.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.040]   What didn't go as planned, what lessons we didn't finish,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.420]   which projects were not up to par.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.080]   Especially in the early years, I would look back and think,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.960]   look at all that curriculum that I bought
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.320]   and we never even got to it, we never even opened it.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   Why is it so natural to look at where we fell short
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120]   when we do these assessments?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.040]   - I think it's out of love for our families
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.620]   that we do this, our students,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.040]   because we take what we are doing seriously.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.840]   And so we want to do a good job.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.780]   It's often an experiment.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.840]   I wasn't homeschooled myself.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.320]   I wasn't classically educated myself.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.200]   And so I think because we love our kids
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.240]   and we love our families so much, we want to do a good job.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.540]   So we're naturally looking for the weaknesses first.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.540]   And that can be, maybe we're holdovers,
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.360]   maybe we're like struggling with perfectionism.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.240]   I know I'm a recovering perfectionist,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.760]   but I also think it's important to look at those things
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.320]   and to have an honest assessment.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.980]   But I also think we shouldn't neglect counting all the good
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.200]   and the gifts that we've been given together.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.760]   There are many, so I think you got to balance it.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.180]   - Yeah, that's really, really wise.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.900]   Okay, so let's take both of those.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   How does it help us not to beat ourselves up, right?
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.580]   It's never gonna be healthy or helpful
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.060]   for you just to beat yourself up as a homeschooling parent,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.340]   or to let your student beat themselves up.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.340]   But how does it help us to frankly face
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.300]   what did not go well?
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.000]   What can we learn from that kind of assessment?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.420]   - I think we can gain some wisdom
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.940]   by thinking about what didn't go well,
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.220]   thinking about where our student is,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.340]   and also thinking about where we as teachers need to improve.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.560]   We're learning too, through this progress,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.900]   this journey of learning.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.580]   And so I think it's helpful to see where we need to improve
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.940]   and to set reasonable goals for next time.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.520]   And I think that's the key of learning anything
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.940]   and teaching a student is we want it to be challenging,
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.220]   but we don't want it to be to drown the kid
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.480]   in something that was meant to nourish their souls.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.820]   And we want, that's a sweet spot that is hard
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.820]   to nail sometimes as a teacher, how much is too much?
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.720]   And we're told by CC to set our own academic goals
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.160]   for our students,
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.680]   which are all on their unique learning journeys.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.600]   We are too as learners on our own unique learning journeys.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.840]   And so we wanna think about where our students are
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   and help them take the next step
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.160]   so that we can continue to coach and encourage them
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   and mentor them and also not give them too many things
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.440]   to work on at once.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.280]   And also think about where we are.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   Do we need more time with a student?
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.000]   Do we need to plan things out better?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.440]   Do we need to anticipate things?
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.040]   We need to tailor the guide for our,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.600]   to meet our particular goals.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.580]   Are we thinking about too much what other students
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.320]   and other families are doing?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.140]   Because the Bible says to compare ourselves,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.700]   like that is foolishness.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.700]   We really need to look at our own selves
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.260]   and our own children and think about
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.880]   what we can do better.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.860]   And then I think spending some time praying,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.680]   talking to our students and asking for the Lord to meet us
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.280]   in that need, remembering we're not alone
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   is really important.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.460]   - Yes, that it is.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.920]   It's a joint endeavor,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.800]   especially as your children get older.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.880]   You are partners in this learning, right?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.220]   It's not just something you are doing
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.960]   to or for your child.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.060]   You become partners in learning.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.680]   It becomes a family culture that you are developing
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.520]   of learning.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.600]   I think that's really good.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.720]   I love that.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.600]   And I think that you're spot on, Brittany.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.320]   I think it is helpful to look honestly
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.520]   at what did not go well,
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.040]   not so that we beat ourselves up about it,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.780]   but so that we without, as much as we can,
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.240]   without the sting of judgment,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.180]   look at it and think, okay, that did not go well.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:52.060]   Did I as the lead learner not tailor that assignment well?
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.920]   Did I not take into account known learning challenges
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.360]   for me or for my students?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.380]   Or were there really unforeseen aspects
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.840]   to that assignment or that conversation
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.800]   or that book or that paper or that time of our life?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.960]   Were there unforeseen things that affected this
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.560]   in a way that maybe I could not have seen coming,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   but that now I can modify and change and go back and do?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.760]   I really like that.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.340]   So when you see that something didn't go well,
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.120]   you don't beat yourself up,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.740]   but you also don't ignore it and think,
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.460]   okay, well, I'm just not gonna look over there.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.680]   I'm just, we're gonna close the book on that
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.560]   and we're just gonna let that be passed
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.940]   and we're just gonna move on.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.660]   'Cause that's not helpful for the future.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.080]   - Right, and our students need a loving mentor,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.880]   a coach to keep them accountable and who better than you?
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.320]   Like the teacher at home, that's what they're craving.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.440]   I know I've seen students really wrestle with that
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.220]   and long for more accountability.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.280]   And I've been guilty of assigning something,
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.520]   not being super clear in instructions
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.500]   and then not assessing it very well.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.780]   And I think that is frustrating to a student.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.460]   It can feel like you're just doing things
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.760]   that don't really matter that much.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.180]   And so I want to think about like,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.740]   where are the opportunities I have
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.260]   to really pour into my students to mentor and coach them
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.860]   and have those really important conversations
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.360]   that no one else can have 'cause no one else knows them
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.720]   or loves them like I do.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.240]   - Yes, Brittany, oh, this is so good.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.920]   Assessment is not a tool to beat up our students.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.120]   Assessment really helps our students
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.480]   to look at what they have done or not done
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.680]   without beating themselves up, but thinking,
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.380]   huh, how could that have gone differently?
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.380]   How can I learn from what I missed last time?
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   How can I gird up my loins to do this in a better way?
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.420]   Wow, that's so good and so healthy.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.700]   And what a great skill to teach our students.
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.700]   If they could learn to honestly and without rancor,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.780]   assess themselves and adjust their stride
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.160]   as they move through life, instead of run away
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.920]   from what they did not do well or didn't understand
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.620]   or beat themselves up until they're black and blue
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.920]   and unwilling to try again.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.240]   Wow, that's super good.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.440]   Okay, that assessment where you frankly face
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.880]   what didn't go well, even if you're doing it right,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.620]   doesn't tell the whole story though, does it?
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.620]   So how can only looking at what did not go well
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.320]   be too limiting to be really helpful?
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.780]   I think it's like, you're not looking at the full picture,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.000]   you're just looking at this tiny detail part of the picture.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.140]   So we need to take time to count what is good
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.100]   and to collect the wins and to remind the student
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.860]   of their progress because like I said earlier,
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.620]   they're just not really good at judging themselves very well
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.760]   and seeing their own progress.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.200]   And that can be super discouraging.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.480]   It can feel like, especially January, February,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.340]   a student might feel that they're sort of treading water
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.700]   or perhaps they have a learning challenge or difference.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.900]   We have those in my family.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.840]   And so the student is constantly overcoming
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.160]   this lie in their head that says they're not smart enough
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.200]   or they're not as smart as the other person
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.740]   or this other student in class
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.920]   or they need to be more like so and so.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.680]   And it can be good to, iron sharpens iron.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.520]   We want students to sharpen each other
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.400]   but also I think just as their coach and mentor,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.780]   their teacher that loves them,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.380]   reminding them of where they were
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.180]   and showing them their progress is what we all need.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.060]   'Cause I think we long for that well done
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.060]   because the Lord made us that way.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.140]   And they need to have some well done.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.100]   They need to see these were good habits.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.280]   These were good routines.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.160]   This is, I saw you grow in confidence here.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.680]   I saw you own this over here.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.320]   I saw you serve over here.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.760]   I see your longing for the Lord, your time in the word
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.860]   that no one has to encourage you to do your prayer,
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.320]   your patience with others,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.000]   the way that you're learning to forgive,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.260]   the way you're serving family.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.280]   I mean like these are just things
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.500]   that we have the opportunity to encourage.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.320]   And sometimes I think we get into sort of a,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.740]   I don't know, just too focused on the negative
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.340]   and we forget to count all the things
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.160]   that the Lord is doing in our family's life
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.000]   and our students' lives.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.320]   - Right, oh this is so good.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.160]   I think, I tend to be,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.360]   and I'm sure that I burden to my children with this
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.020]   many times as a homeschooling mama,
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.980]   I tend to be a perfectionist too.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.120]   And I want everything to be good and beautiful
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.640]   and just right and I want everybody to fully understand,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.140]   I can remember thinking, I want you to fully understand
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.800]   what I have understood and I'm passing on to you
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.880]   and I want everybody to get it.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.540]   I want us to all be able to check off the boxes
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.220]   and cross all the T's.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.400]   And so for me, when I would do assessments,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.220]   I would look at how well did I pass this on
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.080]   and how well did you pick this up?
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.400]   And it's so easy for us to fall into that kind of trap.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   But here's the truth, there are other things
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.520]   that we can assess besides just saying,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.840]   well you did all your Latin exercises.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.800]   You got a 96% on your last math test or assessment.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:13.320]   You won the science fair.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.540]   You wrote all your essentials papers.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.540]   Instead of just looking, just assessing
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.680]   those kinds of milestones, what else?
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   You mentioned some great things that I jotted down
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.440]   because I think, oh that's really good to remember.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   Some other things, other things that are part
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.620]   of homeschool success like an attitude of service
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:41.620]   to somebody else or a habit of persevering.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.920]   What are some other things that we as parents
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   need to recognize as a success or something
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.060]   that needs to be assessed as we're thinking
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.200]   about what went right with homeschooling?
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.860]   - I think there's, I mean, we just need to keep academics
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.800]   as important as I think those are.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.400]   I love classical Christian studies.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.100]   We need to remember that it's for the benefit
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.740]   of the student's eternal soul.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.920]   I think we can get too focused on,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.660]   oh no, is my kid gonna be prepared for college
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.800]   or their future calling or I need to hurry up
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.100]   and get this done and instead I think we need to think
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.660]   about what is important eternally more than academics.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.400]   Where is my student with the Lord?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   Where is my student and their relationships
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.880]   with our family members and friends and people at church
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   in our CC community?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   Where are they asking really important significant questions
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.440]   and learning to read hard things and wrestle?
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.920]   How are they learning to be hospitable
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.840]   and to bear with others in love who might be hard
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.040]   to love in community?
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:06.680]   That habit of contented gratitude,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   those things are things that I hope that I'm growing in
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   as a Christian woman and what I want my student
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.660]   also to grow in.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.200]   So I think learning to happily steward scholarly gifts
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.440]   that we've been given is important.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.160]   I also think learning to respond with mercy
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.600]   to the failings of others, there's a--
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.420]   - And to our own failings, you know, we are not,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.640]   I am not merciful to myself.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.200]   I have tons of patience with children,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.380]   more patience with adults than I have with myself.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.280]   I have absolutely the least patience with myself of anybody.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.000]   - Yeah, absolutely, I mean, I feel that same way.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.740]   There's a prayer I love, it's from Every Moment Holy,
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.220]   volume one, it's a liturgy for students and scholars.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.800]   And a couple of those things I mentioned
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.840]   are from that prayer.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.560]   It's things that I've seen either my challenge students
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   or my daughter or I've grasped a hold of,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.460]   like keeping academics in perspective,
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.520]   because we're trying to do this for the glory of God.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.680]   And the Lord says, you know,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.240]   "Don't be anxious about the future,
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.220]   "don't be anxious about what you're gonna wear
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.280]   "or what you're gonna eat."
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.360]   I mean, I would say how you're gonna earn things
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.420]   or how quickly to get your college credits.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.240]   The whole world says that that's the thing
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   you must pursue right now,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.000]   but the Lord says, "Seek first the kingdom."
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.680]   And so, and all these things will be given to you.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.920]   And He says, "Rejoice, you know, always
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.020]   "and pray about the things that make you anxious
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.400]   "and abide in Him because He's going to fill us."
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.520]   I mean, like, these are the things
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.280]   that I most want my children to walk in,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.720]   because it's the only anchor.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.400]   I mean, Christ is our only anchor.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.520]   And so I remember Lee talking about
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.320]   how the world will tell you all these things
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.040]   that your kids need and that you need,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.860]   and they'll tell your kids they need all these things,
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.480]   but don't trade that opportunity to walk with them
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   and to guide them spiritually and to continue on.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.400]   And that's what encourages me in January
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.600]   is thinking about how the Lord might use
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.760]   our conversations, our studies together,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   our sharpening in community to make us more like His image.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.000]   - I love that.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   There are so many non-academic victories
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.620]   for us as parents to look back on.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.620]   There's so many non-academic wins to pursue.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's not all about getting the lesson done
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.120]   or even retaining the most information.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.700]   Look back over your fall and think,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.080]   did we spend more and more time talking together?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:13.600]   Like you said, do we routinely ask better questions now
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.240]   than we did last year?
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.120]   I love this.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.920]   I like to look back and think, okay,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   did my student tackle big or hard or new projects
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.720]   or subjects more readily?
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.640]   So was their confidence better?
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.160]   Was their determination better?
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.840]   Have they developed a better habit of saying,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.920]   yes, I will, instead of no, I can't at the beginning?
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.440]   Like you said, have we as a family developed
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.500]   good spiritual habits?
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.700]   Are we loving?
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.360]   If you just looked at the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.760]   are we loving?
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.980]   Do we project joy in the face of sorrow?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.640]   Is there more peace with situations
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.240]   that were previously nerve-wracking issues?
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.820]   Are we patient with other people?
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.760]   Are we patient with ourselves?
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.920]   Are we patient with, like you said,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.240]   that challenging member of our community?
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.680]   'Cause if you don't know who's the challenging member
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.300]   of your community, it might be you.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.660]   Are we gentle?
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.440]   Are your children growing in gentleness with one another?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.240]   Are they open to new ideas?
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.380]   Are they open to other people's ways of doing things
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.900]   or seeing things?
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:55.020]   Is your family getting better at pursuing balance in life?
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.300]   'Cause maybe you'll look back and say, you know what?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.120]   We didn't finish all of the Saxon lessons,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.240]   but every day we took a walk together.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.160]   So are you balancing life?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.540]   Are you better at that?
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.700]   And so I think, Brittany, what you and I are saying
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.660]   to the listeners is there are things besides academics
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.660]   that we need to assess.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.300]   And sometimes when we grow a lot in one area,
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.440]   we discover that we've neglected another area.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.240]   Or when we're assessing, we sometimes forget to assess
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   what you rightly called the eternal important things.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:46.320]   Such good suggestions that you have given us.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.520]   I really appreciate it.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.820]   And I know we're almost out of time.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.820]   I wanna ask you, what is one encouragement?
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.140]   'Cause you have homeschooled for a long time, like I have.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.600]   We've homeschooled for a long time.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.100]   So I wanna ask you, Brittany, what is one encouragement
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.380]   you have for mamas and daddies out there
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.000]   as we all begin again in this new year?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.780]   - I try to spend some time just remembering why.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.860]   What is our why?
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.020]   Why did my husband and I think this was important?
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.840]   What was the thing that's held us here?
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.320]   Because I think it can get lost in the details
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   or some upcoming academic challenges that we see
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.980]   on the horizon might make us a little bit anxious.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.140]   But remembering why we're doing this
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.580]   and filling up your own picture
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.100]   so that you can pour out to others, your children,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.700]   I think that's really important.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.500]   Spending time and the word in prayer is paramount
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:59.440]   for us as teachers and parents walking alongside our kids.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.800]   And then just remembering that it's a privilege
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.220]   that we have this other-sidedness
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.120]   that most of the world doesn't have,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.880]   that we know God's in everything we study.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.540]   We know it all relates.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.460]   And we can, I mean, what a better use of our time
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.980]   than to spend our heartbeats hunting for his fingerprints
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.660]   with our children.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.460]   Because the world's not gonna give them that.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.260]   Most schools that are out there, colleges,
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.380]   they're not gonna have that, careers, or even community.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.400]   And so we have this opportunity, these precious hours,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.100]   and you and I know how quickly those go by
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.580]   to seek first the kingdom with our children.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   And I think that would make January full of light, you know.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.300]   - That is so true.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   And you know, listeners, if there are some of you out there
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:59.860]   who are thinking, I think our family's gonna walk away.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.820]   I think we're gonna do something else.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.220]   You know, there are other options for us.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.580]   We're gonna pursue academics in a different way.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.820]   I hope that what Brittany has just said
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.180]   will cause you to pause and reflect
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:22.860]   on how homeschooling, the homeschooling journey
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   is not just about academics.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:34.180]   It's not just about teaching your children how to learn.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.260]   It's about nurturing their soul.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.380]   It's about drawing your family together.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.380]   I absolutely love what you said,
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.380]   that what we do as homeschoolers,
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   when we're doing it right,
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.380]   we are hunting for God's fingerprints on the world.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.180]   And what a joy, an incalculable joy, actually.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.620]   It is to do that with your children.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.180]   And so parents who are assessing
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.780]   whether or not you're gonna keep homeschooling
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.700]   or keep learning together classically as a family,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.540]   take a minute and consider everything
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.380]   that's a part of this homeschooling journey.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.900]   Brittany, thank you so much for the way
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.860]   you have poured encouragement and wisdom into us today.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.060]   - Oh, it's a pleasure.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   I'm giving what I've received from others and from the heart.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.020]   It's a beautiful thing that we get to do this together.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.500]   - It is, it is.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.020]   And listeners, parents, tutors, directors,
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.020]   if you have received some encouragement today
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.380]   and you think, okay, I need some help.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.620]   I need to level up my skills.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.980]   I need to become a better lead learner.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.620]   I need to become a better assessor
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.620]   of my students learning at home.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.300]   I have an idea for you.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.340]   We have something called the classical learning cohort
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.340]   and registrations for the spring semester are starting now.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.100]   So how it works is six times throughout the semester,
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.300]   you meet online with a small group of homeschool parents
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.660]   who are all on the same mission,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.140]   growing their understanding of classical education
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.980]   and developing those lifelong skills
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.860]   that really help us guide our students through learning.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.140]   The cohort would be led by an experienced mentor
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.220]   and you will walk through some hands-on assignments.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   You will work on giving and receiving classical assessments.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.820]   You will work on building an exordium and introduction
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.460]   and developing a review for all the things
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.820]   you want to pass on to your student
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.740]   that will really show you how to engage your student
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.580]   with every lesson.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.260]   Anyhow, if you wanna keep growing in your knowledge
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   and your skills as a classical educator
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.580]   and you really would like a small learning environment,
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.180]   the classical learning cohort is probably for you.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.980]   So like I said, registration for the spring semester
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.420]   has already begun and there are limited spaces.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.820]   So go ahead and sign up or look for more information
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.820]   at classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:54.500]   That's classicalconversations.com/cohort, okay?
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.700]   And I will look for you here next week
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.940]   so we can encourage and grow together.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.900]   Thanks you guys, bye-bye.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.880]   (gentle music)
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.380]   (music fades)
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
