[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Today I want to talk about learning to learn and some of my own systems and approaches to learning,
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.040]   machine learning and other things in my life as well. Now there are a lot of methods that we might
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.080]   talk about that may seem obvious and there are others that I believe, at least for me, are less
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   so. And in particular one very powerful thing for me, we'll definitely talk about that and hopefully
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.840]   a lot of these things will be either reinforcing what you're already doing or something new that
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   you can start applying. But of course at the same time we're all different people, we I think all
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.440]   have different approaches to learning that work best for us and for each person that is going to
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.960]   vary. So I wouldn't go into this video expecting to have this perfect template for learning how to
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.720]   learn that's going to work perfectly for you. It's probably more a case of taking some bits and
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.960]   ignoring other bits and applying it to what you already do. Nonetheless I do believe that this
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.080]   approach, although I don't believe I can cover everything in this one video because there is a
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.720]   lot to cover, I do believe what we will cover is at least a good foundation to tackling learning,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   machine learning and of course other things as well. So let's start, specific to machine learning
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.360]   I think it's very important that I share my sort of view of different things in machine learning.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   I think everything I need to learn seems to be somewhere on a scale of pure theory to pure
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.800]   application. Everything is kind of on that scale somewhere and I think both the theory and both
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.400]   the application are super important and I think when we're learning something it's pretty important
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:22.000]   to find a balance of both and a lot of the time I really have to remind myself of this so I don't
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   end up falling into one or the other too much. So I don't end up focusing purely on theory or purely
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.840]   on application. It's very important to have both of those because what you learn on the theory side
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   of things is always going to support and back up the things that you are actually building. So when
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   you're actually applying your knowledge. We'll talk a little more about that later but I just
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   wanted to cover that very quickly at the start just so we can kind of put everything in the
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:00.640]   scope of that scale of theory to application. So the first thing I want to cover is my general
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.480]   way of thinking when I am approaching something new to learn and that is to go shallow, deepen
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.640]   and then broaden. So this applies when you are learning to code, when you are machine learning
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.000]   for the first time or when you are just learning something new in machine learning or learning a
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.720]   new framework or so on. Now what I mean more specifically by that is going back to that
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.320]   scale that we have. I start with applying something. In most cases, not all cases,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.560]   but most of the time I will start with trying to apply something. So I will take a library or
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.760]   topic and I will try and create some sort of shallow high level tool with it or pipeline with
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   it. And using that you should hopefully build a little bit of an understanding of the overall
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   scope or almost like an overall high level map of this topic or library. And with that you can
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.040]   say okay I have this high level map and now I know okay the main components in whatever this is I'm
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.200]   learning seems to be these three or four things so I need to learn more about these things. And
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.280]   it's important we do this because a lot of people might skip this and if you don't try and understand
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   what you are applying more deeply there's a good chance that you're not going to apply it correctly
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.240]   or it's going to be a very sub-optimal thing that you're building. So I think it's really
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.880]   important to try and understand things more deeply and this is going towards a theory side.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.080]   Right so we're deepening our knowledge, understanding the theory behind whatever
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.880]   this application is. And then once we've deepened our knowledge we should be able to better
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.800]   understand the topic. Okay and this is where we broaden things so we then go back to the
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.720]   application side and we take what we've learned from the theory and reapply it to the application
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.000]   and hopefully at that point we've built something that's a bit more relevant. Now the reason that
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.760]   I start shallow is because for me I find jumping straight into theory is often overwhelming,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.360]   it's confusing and there's just too much going on. I find it really helps to have that high
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.600]   level view of everything first and then from there going in and focusing on little bits.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.520]   So starting shallow, keeping things simple as possible, then diving into the details
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.440]   and then coming back up and sort of broadening or fixing that more high level view that you have
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:00.560]   created. The next one is courses and projects. Now most people know and do study on courses and
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   this is 100% the way to go. You have platforms like Coursera and Udemy which are in my opinion
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.840]   amazing. You have a lot of things out there and then you also have a lot of free courses on places
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.400]   like YouTube. On my channel there are even a few free courses that you can follow along. So
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:30.480]   there really is a huge amount of content out there and whether you want to pay for it or not
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.840]   you can probably find something. However doing course after course is I don't think usually a
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.280]   good idea because courses are, they exist in their own sort of isolated world. The data is usually
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.800]   perfect, the approach to doing something it works because someone else has already done it and
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   they're showing you exactly step by step how to do it. So it's not always a good idea to just keep
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:05.280]   doing courses. Instead what I think really helps is doing projects. Okay so doing projects as well
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   as courses. Projects are really good because they emulate what you're going to be doing in the real
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.440]   world of applying machine learning. You're actually working on something, you're building something,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.840]   you don't know if it's going to work at the start but you're trying to figure it out. And what is
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.640]   very good in terms of your learning with these projects is one I think projects can be really
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.680]   fun and motivating. It's really cool to start a project and work on something and actually build
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.160]   something. Two they are very good at pointing out things that you don't know. So to build something
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.600]   you can't just skip like a component of whatever it is you're building, you need to be able to
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.520]   use it and apply it correctly. And if you don't understand that component you will realize very
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.440]   quickly that you need that component in order to build whatever it is you're building in your
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.560]   project. And without these projects a lot of the time you might not have noticed that you didn't
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.080]   really know anything about this particular thing or maybe you didn't even know that it existed.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   So I think projects are really good for pointing out what you don't know.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.440]   And another really cool thing about projects is at the end of the project you actually
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.080]   have something, you've built something. You can share it with people and you can be proud of
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.240]   whatever it is you've built, which I think is a really cool and fun feeling. As almost a
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.200]   continuation of the last point on projects, it's also a very good idea to see if you can try and
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:54.560]   contribute to open source projects. Now this is a pretty typical piece of advice where people say
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   okay you should contribute to open source and I'm including that as well because it's very good
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.360]   advice. If you can go ahead and start contributing to things, there are a lot of things that will
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:12.480]   happen. First you're contributing to the open source community, you're advancing machine learning
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:20.240]   as a field, which is really cool. Two, you are going to learn whatever library you are going to
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.320]   contribute to very well. You're going to understand it much better than the vast majority of users,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.120]   pretty much everyone other than the other people that also contribute to that library.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.800]   And you're also going to learn a lot of the best practices from what are often some of the best
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   ML practitioners in the world. So that is incredibly useful, even if whatever you
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.440]   attempt to contribute, even if it isn't accepted or even if it is accepted but heavily modified in
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:02.560]   some way, that doesn't really matter so much because either way you've learned and you have
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:10.880]   gained something from the experience. So I wouldn't worry so much about not feeling like
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.680]   you're good enough to contribute to open source because pretty much everyone, even the people that
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.160]   do contribute to open source feel like that, it's normal. Sure you're probably not going to be as
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:29.760]   good as some of the main contributors to these libraries but that's fine, the majority of people
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.800]   aren't, everyone starts somewhere so I would recommend just trying. Maybe it doesn't work out,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.960]   maybe it does, either way you're going to learn and you're going to grow from that process. So
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:51.680]   that's great, it's a win-win. Point number four is to write. So I write a lot and the reason that I
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:00.720]   wrote my first article wasn't to share anything with people or to try and make money from articles
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.320]   or anything like that. The reason that I first started to write was simply because I wanted to
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:16.000]   learn about these different things that I was writing about and the reason that I thought okay
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'm going to start writing articles is because I thought okay, I thought back to university or
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.760]   college and I thought about that learning experience of writing reports on different things
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:40.000]   and having these sort of coursework assignments and writing this report and when you are writing
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   those reports you realize what you don't know and you solidify the sort of thoughts that you have
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.040]   on all these different topics. You solidify them as you write them down on paper and that is really
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   good for trying to process something and understand something more deeply. So I really think that
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:15.840]   writing is one of the best ways to learn something more deeply and I'm not saying you necessarily
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:23.760]   have to write articles but if you just try and do something that emulates that university, college
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:33.200]   writing experience then I think it will probably help you a lot whether that's just personal,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:43.120]   handwritten notes or online articles. I promise you that writing will help your learning so so
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   much. And the final point that I want to share is to do what interests you. Now you have to be
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.640]   somewhat realistic with this, you can't just do whatever you want like I don't know play games
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:07.680]   all day, that's not what I mean. What I mean is when you are for example choosing what to study
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.760]   at university and you have all these choices try and go for something that you actually find
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.520]   interesting not something that you think is going to make you money or something like that. Of
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.440]   course be sensible and this is you know this is my advice it works for me it doesn't necessarily
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:35.920]   work for everyone or even most people I just know for me it has seemed to work. Just try and follow
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:44.160]   what is most interesting to you. Don't think so much about prestige or money or any of these other
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.480]   things just do what you want to do and I say that because to be good at something it helps so much
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.560]   to actually be interested in that topic and for me it wasn't until studying in my master's that I
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:06.640]   realized this and during my master's I got to choose a lot of the modules that I studied which
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.800]   was pretty much the first time I got to do that and I chose a lot of the really hard modules.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.280]   I was advised not to choose all of these hard modules because it would be too much but I chose
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:28.080]   them anyway because I thought they were super interesting and that year was you know I just
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.600]   got incredibly obsessed with what I was learning I was super interested and I found it really easy
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:42.240]   not because I didn't have to work much I worked like crazy I did you know I basically lived in
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:48.080]   the library I worked seven days a week pretty much every week maybe there was a odd day off
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:54.960]   probably less than once a month you know I worked like crazy but it was super easy because I was
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:05.200]   interested and that worked out really well I got really good grades stumbled into AI I did my thesis
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:14.800]   in NLP and it kind of led me on the path that has brought me to where I am now which is somewhere
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:24.160]   that I'm super happy with so doing or following what I was interested in was for me probably the
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.280]   best thing I could have done. Now of course everything varies person to person I don't
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.480]   know if it's the best advice for everyone but I really do think for me at least following those
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   interesting subjects interesting topics it just helps so much it makes everything super super
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:52.080]   easy. So that's it um you know there are a lot of different things to talk about when it comes to
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:59.440]   learning and I realized that whilst I was putting together what I was going to talk about in this
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:07.120]   video I dropped a lot of things so for sure in the future I'm definitely going to do more on this
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:15.600]   sort of thing if people are interested in it but for now I think those five points are generally
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   pretty much what I go by what I follow now so thank you very much for watching I hope it's been
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:31.280]   interesting and useful and I will see you again in the next one. Bye!
