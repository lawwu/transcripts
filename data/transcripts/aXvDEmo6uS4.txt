[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.460]   Today, we are going to talk about science-based protocols
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.460]   for sleep, mood, learning, nutrition,
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640]   exercise of various kinds, strength and endurance,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.020]   and hypertrophy.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.080]   And we are going to talk about some protocols
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.300]   that relate to creativity.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.260]   We're going to talk about behavioral protocols,
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.040]   supplement-based protocols,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.400]   all science backed by quality peer review literature.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.120]   The reason that we're holding this episode now
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360]   is that in the recent previous episodes,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   we've covered some pretty intense and in-depth topics.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.840]   We've talked about vision and how we see
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.420]   and how to get better at seeing and how to maintain vision.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660]   We've talked about hearing and balance.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.680]   We've talked about chemical sensing,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840]   and we had a guest episode
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.340]   that covered a lot of information
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.100]   about new and emerging technologies in neuroscience,
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.620]   as well as mental health.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.220]   That was the interview episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.280]   So given that we've covered so much detailed information
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.360]   in the previous 27 episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.200]   I decided that we would hold office hours.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020]   Office hours in the university setting
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.840]   are when students come to the professor's office
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.440]   or you meet outdoors on campus or in the classroom
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.480]   to review the material and questions from lecture
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.360]   in more detail.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   Now, unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.200]   to meet face-to-face in real life,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280]   but nonetheless, you've been sending your questions,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   putting them in the comments section on YouTube, et cetera,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600]   and I've prepared a number of answers
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.580]   to the questions that have shown up most frequently.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.960]   Now, in order to provide context and structure
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   to the way that we will address these questions,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.040]   I've arranged the science and science-based protocols
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.640]   that relate to various aspects of life,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.560]   such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.600]   anxiety, creativity, et cetera,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   into the context of a day.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.800]   Selecting the unit of a day
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.240]   in order to deliver this science information and protocols
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   is not a haphazard decision on my part.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.580]   It's actually the case that every cell in our body,
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.120]   every organ in our body and our brain is modulated
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.680]   or changes across the 24-hour day
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.040]   in a very regular and predictable rhythm,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.320]   and it's no coincidence that the earth spins once
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.600]   on its axis every 24 hours.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.480]   These two things are coordinated by virtue of genes
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.680]   and different proteins and things that are expressed
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.720]   in every cell of your body,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   and so selecting the unit of the day
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.160]   is not just a practical one,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   but it's one that's related to our deeper biology.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   You may have heard in my interview episode
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.660]   with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.180]   in order to juggle a tremendous workload,
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.400]   a full-time clinical practice, a lab of 40-plus people,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   a family of five children, et cetera,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.480]   breaks up his life into units of days,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.040]   and so today we are going to further dissect the day
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.360]   as a unit that one can manage and manage extremely well
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.340]   and, in fact, can optimize.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.240]   So we're basically going to talk about
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.120]   how to leverage science-based protocols,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.340]   and when I say science, I mean quality,
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.520]   peer-reviewed science published in excellent journals.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   We're going to talk about how to take that science,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.740]   convert it into specific protocols
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.520]   that break up along the course of a single day
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.140]   and direct certain types of behaviors
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.300]   in order to optimize the various features of life.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.720]   I will couch this in the context of what I do
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.920]   across a daily 24-hour rhythm.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   That doesn't mean that you have to follow this schedule
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.280]   at all or even in part.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.640]   It's just by way of example.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.600]   Any number of the different things that I described
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.040]   could be applied to any number of different schedules
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.680]   or frameworks, but if there's one truth
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.320]   that applies to all of us is that we all have to exist
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   within the context of this 24-hour rhythm
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.120]   that we all possess, so that's what we'll focus on.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.700]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.520]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.640]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.520]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.540]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.040]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.320]   that I believe are the very highest quality possible.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.760]   Developed by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.420]   Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses were developed
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.000]   with their intention to create sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.400]   that could be worn anywhere, so while exercising
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.320]   or while working, at home, while driving.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.720]   The reason I like Roca glasses so much
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.120]   is that, first of all, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   The optical clarity of the lenses is excellent,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.380]   and so I often just forget that I even have them on.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.780]   When I'm outside and I'm wearing sunglasses,
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.040]   they have this really terrific feature,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.880]   which is that I can move in and out of shadows
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.480]   or the cloud cover can change,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.960]   and I can see perfectly well the entire time.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.200]   You know, many eyeglasses and sunglasses that I've tried,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.880]   depending on what we call the ambient lighting conditions,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.760]   the local lighting conditions outside,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.440]   I have to take them off or put them back on.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.960]   It's really annoying for me, but with Roca glasses,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.760]   somehow, I'm assuming because they really understand
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.880]   the science of the visual system,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.400]   the eyeglasses and sunglasses work seamlessly
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.800]   with whatever environment you're in,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.440]   so that's absolutely terrific.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.120]   Another thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.680]   is that their aesthetic is really terrific.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.120]   Now, I don't think I'm alone in saying
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   that many performance glasses, as they're called,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.000]   end up making people look like a cyborg,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.920]   but the sunglasses are of the sort that, you know,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.780]   you can wear while running or biking or driving
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.280]   or out to dinner.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.440]   I don't typically wear sunglasses while out to dinner,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.280]   but you get the idea.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.900]   You can wear them anywhere, and they look very natural.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.920]   They have a huge number of different styles to select from.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.520]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.640]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A, .com,

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   your first order.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.640]   That's Roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.000]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.600]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.180]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.740]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.960]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.920]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.480]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.700]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.820]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.940]   With Inside Tracker, it alleviates a specific problem
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.920]   that's associated with most, if not all,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.440]   of the other blood tests and DNA tests out there,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.700]   and that problem is you get information back
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.020]   about the levels of various things, metabolic factors,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.620]   hormones, et cetera,
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.620]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.900]   With Inside Tracker, they have this terrific dashboard
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.800]   that allows you to both see your levels of hormones,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.660]   metabolic factors, and the rest,
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.740]   but also it suggests specific things that you can do
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.480]   with your nutrition, your exercise, and lifestyle,
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.700]   and so forth, in order to bring those levels
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.840]   into the ranges that are best for your immediate
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.460]   and long-term health.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.940]   In addition, they make the whole process
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.020]   of getting your blood and DNA taken very easy.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.500]   They'll even come to your home to take the sample.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.260]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.220]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.060]   and if you do that,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.300]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.460]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.180]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.860]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.780]   that are ideally matched to your sleep needs.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.580]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.640]   about eight months ago, and I can honestly say
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.820]   it's the best sleep that I've ever had in my entire life,
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.820]   and that's because the mattress was actually designed for me,
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.900]   and you can have a mattress designed for you.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.660]   If you go to helixsleep.com,
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.560]   they have this free, very brief two-minute quiz
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.140]   that asks you a number of questions,
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.940]   like do you sleep on your side or your back?
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.500]   Do you tend to run warm while you sleep,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.880]   or do you tend to get cold in the middle of the night?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.500]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.260]   and that's fine too.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.260]   After taking that quiz,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.880]   they will match you to a specific mattress
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.180]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.300]   I matched to the so-called Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.560]   because I wanted a mattress that was not too firm,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.420]   not too soft, and as I mentioned, I absolutely love it.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.160]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.240]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.660]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.900]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.540]   and you'll get up to $200 off your mattress order
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.700]   and two free pillows.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.820]   They also make these terrific pillows.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.100]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.020]   and you get to try out the mattress for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.980]   If you don't like it, they'll come pick it up,
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.100]   and they'll take it away, but I think you'll love it.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.340]   I certainly love mine.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.300]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.260]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.340]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.620]   So let's talk about how to apply
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.180]   quality peer-reviewed science to your day
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.500]   and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.600]   creativity, meal timing, et cetera.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.660]   As I mentioned earlier,
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.060]   I'm going to do this in the context of my day
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.880]   and what I typically do.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.180]   However, the specific protocols
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.460]   for any number of different things, sleep relaxation,
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.280]   meal timing, exercise, et cetera,
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.540]   any one or all of those could be rearranged
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.940]   to suit your specific needs.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.100]   I'm going to tell you what I do from morning until waking
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.060]   and even what I do while I sleep
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.260]   in order to optimize my sleep.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.500]   So let's start with getting up in the morning.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.660]   Now, for me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6 a.m.,
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.200]   6.30, sometimes as late as 7 a.m.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.500]   I don't typically sleep much later than 7 a.m.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.740]   The first thing I do after I wake up
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.240]   is I take the pen that's on my nightstand
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.140]   and the pad of paper on my nightstand
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.220]   and I write down the time in which I woke up.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.700]   Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.860]   I realize this is considered a sin
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.900]   and has certain hazards associated with it,
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.660]   but I put my phone on airplane mode
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.020]   about an hour before I go to sleep.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.380]   And then I set my alarm typically for 6.30 a.m.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.300]   And some days the alarm wakes me up,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.740]   other days I wake up before the alarm.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.520]   And yes, some days the alarm goes off
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.100]   and I hit snooze a few times.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.940]   And then usually by 7 a.m. I am up and out of bed.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.100]   The reason for writing down what time I wake up
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.240]   is because I want to know that average wake up time.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.980]   That average wake up time
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.860]   informs what's called my temperature minimum.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.900]   It tells me when my body temperature was lowest.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   The temperature minimum is the time in each 24-hour cycle
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.300]   that your body temperature is lowest.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.260]   I don't sleep with a thermometer in my mouth or elsewhere,
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   and I don't think you should either.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.660]   Instead, I know that the lowest temperature
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.860]   that my body will be at across the 24-hour cycle
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.060]   tends to be two hours before my typical wake up time.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.820]   And I want to know that number.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.220]   It's called our temperature minimum.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.580]   So if you're somebody that typically wakes up at 8 a.m.,
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.260]   then your temperature minimum is sometime around 6 a.m.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.660]   Remember, the temperature minimum
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.700]   is a time in the 24-hour cycle.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.640]   I don't care what my actual temperature is.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.220]   I care when my lowest temperature is.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.900]   And I know that that lowest temperature
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.000]   is approximately two hours before my average wake up time.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.860]   So I highly recommend that you write down when you wake up
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.940]   or track that in some way that works for you
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.080]   and use that as a reference point
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.460]   to determine your temperature minimum.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.780]   We will return to the temperature minimum
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.200]   and how you can leverage the temperature minimum
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.180]   for several things, shifting your clock,
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.060]   shifting your circadian sleep schedule and wake schedule,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.120]   also for shifting your eating schedule, et cetera.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.400]   We will return to that.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.320]   But even if you don't travel,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.900]   even if you don't care about things like jet lag,
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.820]   even if you sleep fabulously all year round,
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.540]   never have a poor night's sleep.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.960]   Knowing your temperature minimum,
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.340]   that time when your temperature is at its lowest point,
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.980]   is a valuable thing to know.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.000]   The second thing I do after I wake up
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.520]   is to get into forward ambulation,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.600]   which is just nerd speak for taking a walk.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.580]   I have a dog, and as many of you know, he's a bulldog,
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.420]   and he doesn't really like to walk,
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.080]   especially not in the morning.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.420]   But for humans and for animals,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.180]   there's a phenomenon whereby
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.400]   when we generate our own forward motion, forward ambulation,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.140]   visual images pass by us on our eyes, so-called optic flow.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.760]   And for those of you that are low vision or no vision,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.280]   the same phenomenon occurs in the auditory system.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.240]   Sounds pass by us in so-called auditory flow.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   Getting into a mode of forward ambulation
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   and especially experiencing visual flow
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.880]   has a powerful effect on the nervous system.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.920]   The effect it has is essentially to quiet
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.260]   or reduce the amount of neural activity
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.180]   in this brain structure called the amygdala.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.660]   Amygdala means almond,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.440]   and many of you have probably heard about the amygdala
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.000]   for its role in anxiety and fear and threat detection.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.840]   And indeed, the amygdala is part of the network in the brain
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.960]   that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.240]   It does a bunch of other things too,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.360]   but that's one of its primary functions.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.500]   There are now at least half a dozen quality papers
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.740]   published in quality peer review journals
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.040]   that show that forward ambulation,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.240]   walking or biking or running,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.080]   and generating optic flow in particular
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.200]   has this incredible property of lowering activity
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.720]   in the amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.640]   There are two papers that I'd like to highlight
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.480]   in particular that relate to this phenomenon.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.620]   The first one was published in the journal Neuron,
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.580]   and the title of this paper
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.760]   is "Whole-Brain Functional Ultrasound Imaging."
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.360]   That just means they have a cool technique
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.660]   to evaluate the activity of structures in the brain
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.240]   across the entire brain,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   reveals brain modules for visual motor integration.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.980]   What they found in this study,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.680]   and I should mention the first author is Massey.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.300]   This comes from Boton-Roska's group.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.180]   This was work done in mice,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.400]   but I will talk about other species in a moment.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.800]   What they found was essentially
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.020]   that when these mice walk forward
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.640]   and their eyes move from side to side,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.880]   which is a natural consequence of moving forward,
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.880]   so-called optic flow is flowing past their eyes,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.800]   many brain areas are activated,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.640]   increase in their level of firing,
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.760]   but the amygdala in particular reduced its levels of firing.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   That's a very interesting finding, but it is in mice.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.440]   However, another paper,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.680]   "Eye Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.080]   via Amygdala Deactivation,"
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.820]   was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.260]   a strong journal, and shows that, again,
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.320]   these eye movements, these lateral eye movements
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.780]   from side to side reduce activity levels
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.760]   in this fear/threat/anxiety center in the brain,
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.600]   the amygdala.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   Now, those are eye movements.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.680]   They didn't specifically look at forward ambulation,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.960]   and yet other papers have looked at forward ambulation,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.840]   and we know that forward ambulation, walking forward,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.480]   generates the sorts of eye movements that cause optic flow
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.160]   and reductions in amygdala activation.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.920]   So for me, this process of taking a walk each morning
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.580]   isn't about exercise.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.040]   It's not about burning calories.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.540]   It's not about any of that.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.440]   It's really about getting into optic flow
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.120]   and reducing the levels of amygdala activation.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.920]   Now, I don't have anxiety.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.580]   At least I don't have chronic anxiety
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.100]   or generalized anxiety.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.560]   I tend to have a lot of energy,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.580]   but at these points in the morning, I'm not very energetic.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.040]   Sometimes I'm sort of shuffling more than I'm walking,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.340]   in fact, and Costello is almost always shuffling,
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.960]   and I'm almost always trying to drag him
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.520]   first thing in the morning,
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.020]   but that walk is a particularly important protocol each day
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.720]   because it really serves to push my neurology
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.340]   in the direction that I'd like it to go,
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.320]   which is alert but not anxious,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.840]   and it's kind of a fine line sometimes,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.320]   especially as events surface throughout the day,
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.680]   emails come in, text messages come in,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.260]   get bombarded with a number of things.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.900]   I want to be alert and responsive.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.000]   I want to be able to focus,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.640]   but I don't want to feel anxious or reactive to these things.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.260]   So the forward ambulation and this optic flow
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.280]   is the way that I ensure, based on quality peer review data,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.440]   that my amygdala activation is slightly suppressed.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.540]   Now, at the same time, I also want the alertness.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.160]   I want alert and focused.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.020]   I don't just want to be sleepy or super relaxed.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.620]   I want to have a high degree of focus and alertness
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.120]   because I'm soon going to move into a bout of work.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.980]   I need to lean into the day.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.460]   So in order to do that,
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.960]   I make sure that the walking is done outdoors.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.440]   That might be sort of a duh,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   but many people get up and start moving around their house,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.360]   their apartment, and they don't go anywhere,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.640]   and just walking around inside,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.320]   it will generate some optic flow,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.080]   but nothing like the sort of optic flow
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.660]   that you can generate in larger environments,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.240]   like outdoors environments.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.320]   If you can't get outdoors,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   doing it indoors is perfectly fine,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.120]   but it's not going to have the same magnitude
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.840]   of positive effect.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.600]   Now, in order to get the alertness,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.840]   I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.880]   I know many of you have heard me talk about this ad nauseum
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.300]   on various podcasts and this podcast,
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.640]   but getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.960]   is absolutely vital to mental and physical health.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.940]   It is perhaps the most important thing
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.360]   that any and all of us can and should do
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   in order to promote metabolic wellbeing,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.500]   promote the positive functioning of your hormone system,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.840]   get your mental health steering in the right direction.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.120]   There are a number of reasons for this,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.780]   but before I get into those reasons,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.560]   let me just emphasize what the protocol is.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.200]   The protocol is get outdoors,
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.940]   ideally with no sunglasses if you can do that safely,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.760]   even if there's cloud cover.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.960]   More photons, light information are coming through that
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.280]   cloud cover than would be coming
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.720]   from a very bright indoor bulb.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.540]   So getting outdoors is absolutely key.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.920]   How long should you do this?
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   It's going to depend on the brightness of the environment.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.520]   It's going to depend on a number of different factors.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.600]   Two minutes would be a minimum.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.560]   10 minutes would be even better.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.440]   And if you can, 30 minutes would be fantastic.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.400]   Now it's a very bright day or you live in a place
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.960]   where there's bright sunlight, clear day on a snow field,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.220]   you would only need something like 60 seconds,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.360]   but most people aren't living in those sorts of conditions.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.280]   So getting outside for a 10 minute walk
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.600]   or a 15 minute walk will basically ensure
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.200]   that you're getting adequate stimulation
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.800]   of these neurons in the eye that are called
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.680]   the melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.820]   I know that's a mouthful.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.080]   These are neurons that don't care about shapes of objects
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.440]   or the motion of objects.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.120]   These are neurons that convey to the brain
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.600]   that it's daytime and it's time to be alert.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   And it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.100]   within every cell and organ of your body,
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.660]   from your liver to your gut, to your heart, to your brain.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.820]   It really sets things down the right path.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.600]   Early in the day, we experience a natural and healthy bump
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.360]   in a hormone called cortisol.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.740]   Cortisol comes from the amygdala.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.140]   That cortisol, as I mentioned, is healthy and normal
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.920]   and promotes wakefulness.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.760]   It actually promotes a healthy immune system.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.720]   So I know you've heard that stress and cortisol
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   disrupt the immune system,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.280]   but not the short little pulse of cortisol
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.560]   that you get each morning.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.320]   It's very important that that pulse of cortisol
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.140]   arrive early in the day.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.440]   I want to emphasize this again.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.680]   It's very important that that pulse of cortisol
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.360]   arrive early in the day.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.400]   And that pulse of cortisol is going to happen
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.520]   once every 24 hours, no matter what.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.440]   It's going to happen and you get to time it.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.600]   How do you time it?
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.920]   Primarily by when you view bright sunlight
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.280]   or bright light of another kind.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.960]   And we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.300]   So you want that cortisol pushed early.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.140]   If you wake up before the sun comes out,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.080]   it's fine to turn on artificial lights,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.000]   but then you would want to get outside as soon as you can
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   to get this natural light stimulation of your eyes.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.680]   And it does have to be to your eyes.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.480]   Just to really drill down into the details for a moment.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.080]   You don't want to stare directly at the sun
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.460]   or any light that's so bright that it feels painful.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.360]   If you feel like you have to close your eyes or blink,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.560]   please do, you don't want to damage your retinas.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.880]   The point here is to get the sunlight indirectly.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.760]   It's going to essentially be scattered everywhere
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.040]   through the cloud cover.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.400]   But you know from looking at a flashlight
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.720]   directly into that flashlight versus looking at the beam
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.960]   that flashlight generates on the ground,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.240]   that if you're standing in the shade,
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.400]   you're going to get less of that sunlight than you are
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.560]   if you're out in an open field.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.520]   So this is why the time outside it's going to need to vary
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.080]   depending on your particular environment.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.960]   But do your best to do this every day.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.200]   If you miss a day, no big deal,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.400]   but try not to miss more than one day.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.580]   Otherwise your mental and physical health
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.120]   will start to suffer.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.000]   And doing this each day costs nothing, it's just time.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.920]   You can combine it with the forward ambulation with the walk
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.840]   and the optic flow that I talked about before.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   And that's what I do each morning
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.600]   to generate a sense of alertness in my body
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.920]   and brain to generate a sense of calm yet alert.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.080]   And that's also what I do with Costello, with my bulldog.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.920]   People have asked me,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.480]   do these same mechanisms apply to animals?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.240]   Well, the reality is many of these mechanisms
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.200]   were actually discovered in animals
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.320]   and then were tested in humans
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.720]   and verified that they also exist in humans.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   Not always, sometimes it was the reverse
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.440]   where they were tested first in humans
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.120]   and then brought to animals.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.220]   But indeed your dog, your horse,
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.320]   I don't know what other animals are out there,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.520]   they need this.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.560]   Now, if you have a hamster or a nocturnal animal,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.840]   the reason why they like to run on their wheels at night
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.360]   is because they're nocturnal,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.440]   they don't like being in the light.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.900]   Light actually causes them to freeze, right?
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.280]   Actually, if you are into aquaria, you like fish,
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.200]   they always say don't overfeed your fish,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.440]   you'll kill the fish, that's true.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.800]   But guess what the fastest way to kill a fish is?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.020]   To keep the lights on 24 hours a day.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.280]   They also need circadian rhythms, these 24 hour rhythms.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.700]   So we'll do an entire month at some point about pet health,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.740]   but meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.500]   So now we have our first protocol,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.400]   which is to write down the time of day that you wake up.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.080]   The second protocol is to take a walk
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.240]   first thing in the morning.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.400]   And the third protocol is woven in with that walk,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.320]   at least for me, which is to get that sunlight exposure.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.920]   Now, if you can't get sunlight exposure,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.800]   you absolutely can't.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.260]   I don't necessarily recommend
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.860]   buying one of these dawn alarm lights.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.160]   And I'm sorry to say this,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.840]   but they're just vastly overpriced
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.740]   relative to what they are.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.700]   They're basically a bright LED.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.000]   I instead use, I have a pad that's a 930 lux light pad.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.140]   I think it was designed for drawing.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.700]   Those are available at a fraction of the cost
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.360]   that a morning light simulator would provide,
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.540]   and yet it's really bright enough, at least for me.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.620]   I tend to put it on my desk while I work each morning.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.920]   So here's a principle that you can leverage.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.540]   If you want to be alert, view bright lights
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.200]   and make those lights above you or in front of you.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.040]   If you want to go to sleep soon
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.080]   or you don't want to be awake for whatever reason,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.980]   try and eliminate your exposure to light.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.920]   And this is, again,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.960]   is not about exposure of the skin to light.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.840]   This is about exposure of your eyes,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.200]   of your neural retinas to light.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.320]   For those of you that are concerned about blue light,
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.840]   I want to emphasize that blue light
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.620]   is precisely the wavelength of light
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   that is optimal for stimulating these neurons in your eye,
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.960]   which set your circadian rhythms properly.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.740]   So you don't want to shield yourself from blue light
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.560]   early in the day or throughout the day
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.760]   or anytime you want to be awake.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.980]   In fact, that could have a number
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.900]   of detrimental consequences.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.720]   Fortunately, all those consequences are going to be reversible
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.840]   after a short period of time of making sure
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.740]   that you don't wear your blue blockers during the day.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.900]   Please, the time to wear blue blockers, if you do,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.640]   is at night and in the evening
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.460]   when you're headed towards sleep.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.280]   My colleague, Samir Hattar,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.180]   who is head of the chronobiology unit
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.380]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.160]   has spoken about this before on my Instagram.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.720]   We held an Instagram Live and I said,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.900]   "Samir, what do you think about blue blockers?"
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.400]   And he said, "I don't think that's a good idea at all
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.900]   "unless it's really late at night
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.460]   "and you're in a bright environment
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.620]   "and you're trying to limit the amount of bright light
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.060]   "that impacts the eyes."
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.680]   Eliminating specific wavelengths of light,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.500]   in Samir's opinion, and also in my opinion,
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.280]   is not a natural thing for the visual system
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.840]   and the brain to experience.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.960]   Some people get headaches while they work on the computer
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.880]   all day or staring at screens,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.900]   and so they get blue blockers thinking
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.300]   that's going to protect them from their headaches.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.540]   However, any protection that you get from headaches
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.960]   from blue blockers is going to be minimal
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.440]   in comparison to what's really going on there,
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.300]   which is that people are viewing devices
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.960]   and screens up close for too many hours
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.680]   throughout the 24-hour cycle.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   A better remedy would be to step away from that computer
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.480]   from time to time and to make sure
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.260]   that you can look far off into the distance,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.520]   ideally a distance longer than 20 feet,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.560]   like view a horizon, go out on a balcony,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.200]   things of that sort, take a walk around,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.500]   get into optic flow.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.220]   So if you're into blue blockers,
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.500]   make sure you're only wearing them
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.520]   in the late evening and at night.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360]   I personally don't wear blue blockers at all.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.920]   I prefer to just control my light viewing behavior
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   by doing this.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.320]   I do the other form of circadian control,
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.200]   which is to dim the lights.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.800]   And I do that because dimming the lights
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.280]   and setting them lower in the environment
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.640]   sets up the brain and body for sleep much better
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.560]   than simply just wearing some blue blockers, excuse me.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.120]   And please know if you do wear blue blockers,
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.880]   that if the light in your environment is bright enough,
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.180]   it doesn't matter if you're blocking out the blues.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.860]   These cells in the eye will respond
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.880]   to other wavelengths of light.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.840]   So I have no vendetta against the blue blockers.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.760]   And I fully expect the blue blockinistas to come after me
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.680]   with, I guess, blue blockers.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.200]   But as you do that, please understand
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.000]   that the biology points in the direction
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.880]   of get a lot of bright light throughout the day,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.480]   including blue light, and at night,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.580]   just limit the total amount of overall light
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.760]   that you're exposed to, including from screens.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   So then Costello and I get back from our walk.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.520]   Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.080]   Sometimes it was 60 minutes,
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.060]   depending on how slowly Costello was walking that day.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.800]   Indeed, many mornings,
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.600]   I'm the guy carrying his bulldog back up the hill.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.820]   My neighbors know me so well.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.680]   They know Costello so well that they've since stopped
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.100]   pulling over and asking if the dog is okay.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.800]   Sometimes they'll ask if I'm okay.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.200]   Nonetheless, we get back.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.420]   I give him his food.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.220]   I give him his water.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.000]   And I give me my water.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.600]   I'm a big believer based on quality peer review data
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.240]   that hydration is essential for mental performance.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.340]   Now, I confess, I don't really like drinking big glasses
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.140]   or big jugs of water first thing in the morning.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.840]   I don't know why, but my thirst doesn't tend
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.160]   to kick in first thing.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.200]   You may be different.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.520]   Either way, I force myself essentially to drink
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.240]   at least 16 and most days, 32 ounces of water.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.860]   I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.600]   As many of you know, neurons require ionic flow.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.240]   What that means is neurons need sodium,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.060]   they need magnesium, and they need potassium
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.800]   in order to function.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.980]   We do tend to get dehydrated at night,
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.800]   even if the day is not very hot.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.000]   I try and top off or I try and make sure
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.520]   that I'm hydrated early in the day before I begin any work.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.440]   So I make myself drink this water
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.640]   with a little bit of sea salt.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.480]   How much sea salt?
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.880]   If you really want to get detailed,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.660]   I suppose it's about half a teaspoon.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.200]   It's not much.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.440]   That's what I do.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.140]   And I drink that more or less room temperature.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.720]   I find that drinking really cold water
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   first thing in the day kind of like cramps up my insides.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.240]   So I don't do that.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.300]   At that point, I start thinking about
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.840]   and fantasizing about and craving caffeine,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.320]   but I don't drink that caffeine yet.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.620]   I purposely delay my caffeine intake
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.380]   to 90 minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.300]   Of course, I know when I wake up because I wrote it down,
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.360]   although it's pretty easy to commit to memory.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.240]   The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.580]   that induces a sense of sleepiness
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.920]   is the buildup of adenosine,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.640]   or as some people call it adenosine in our system.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.780]   The buildup of adenosine accumulates
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.660]   the longer we are awake.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.200]   So when I wake up in the morning,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.560]   when you wake up in the morning,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.440]   your adenosine levels are likely to be very low.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.840]   However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.640]   It's actually a competitive antagonist for you aficionados.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.560]   It sort of parks in the receptor
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.120]   that adenosine normally would park at
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.320]   and prevents adenosine from acting on that receptor.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.580]   That's why you feel more alert
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.400]   because it's essentially blocking the effect
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.020]   of this sleepiness factor that we all create
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.940]   called adenosine.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.000]   The reason for delaying caffeine intake
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.160]   90 minutes to two hours after waking
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.660]   is I want to make sure that I don't have a late afternoon
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.920]   or even early afternoon crash from caffeine.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.380]   One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.360]   is to drink a bunch of caffeine,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.160]   block all those adenosine receptors,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.800]   and then by early or late afternoon,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.720]   when that caffeine starts to wear off
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.760]   and gets dislodged from the receptors,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.280]   a lower level of adenosine
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.980]   is able to create a greater level of sleepiness.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.560]   It took me years to figure this out.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.020]   I used to wake up and I'd think,
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.960]   oh, I don't want to drink caffeine too close to bedtime,
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.060]   so I'm going to start drinking my caffeine really early.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.240]   I let my cortisol naturally come up in the morning.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.040]   I avoid drinking caffeine
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.800]   until about 90 minutes or two hours after waking.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.760]   And when I do that,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.720]   I find that I don't experience the afternoon crash.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.600]   At least I don't experience that crash
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.020]   unless I do something foolish
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.160]   like ingest far too much food at lunch
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.640]   or I stay up all night the night before.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.980]   But provided I don't do anything foolish like that,
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.400]   delaying caffeine at 90 minutes to two hours
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.120]   optimizes this relationship between adenosine
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.920]   and wakefulness and sleepiness
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.680]   in a way that really provides a nice consistent arc
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.160]   of energy throughout the day
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.200]   and brings energy down as I'm headed toward sleep
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.760]   and falling asleep.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.960]   My primary objective early in the day
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   is to get into a mode of being focused yet alert
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.320]   so that I can get work done.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.360]   I found that the best way for me to achieve that state
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.860]   is through fasting.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.480]   So I don't eat anything until about 11 a.m. or 12 noon.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.440]   I'm not absolutely religious about it.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   There are days when I'll have a few Brazil nuts
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.360]   or a spoonful or three of almond butter, for instance,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.400]   but most days I'm not doing that.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.300]   I'm just not eating anything.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.260]   I'm drinking some caffeine.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.560]   Caffeine source for me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.960]   Those are my preferred sources.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.680]   I tend to avoid coffee these days.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   Occasionally I'll have a cup,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.740]   but most often I stick to the teas.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.720]   I drink water as much as I feel I need to and want to,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.560]   and I also drink my athletic greens,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.040]   which is compatible at least for me with fasting.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.720]   Let's talk about why fasting works
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.120]   to create this heightened state of alertness
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.580]   yet calm brain state.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.760]   Fasting increases levels of adrenaline,
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.200]   also called epinephrine in the brain and body.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.720]   And when our levels of epinephrine and adrenaline
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.960]   are increased, we learn better, we can focus better.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.440]   There's terrific data supporting that.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.240]   You don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline, too high.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   That feels like stress and panic.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.300]   You get jittery, you can't focus.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.440]   But in its optimal range,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.840]   adrenaline really provides a heightened sense of focus
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.800]   and the ability to encode,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.240]   meaning bring in and retain, remember information.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.960]   And so since my job is mainly a cerebral one
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.440]   where I'm writing grants and working on papers, et cetera,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   I fast in the early part of the day.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.840]   I mentioned ingesting things like guayusa or yerba mate,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.520]   or in my case, athletic greens.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.800]   Many people ask, in fact,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.600]   there's a whole community and discussion boards, et cetera,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.400]   and YouTube comments on the internet
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.440]   about what breaks a fast and what doesn't.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.600]   The fact of the matter is
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.400]   that's going to be highly individual
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.340]   because it's going to depend
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.520]   on how sensitive your blood sugar is.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.480]   And more accurately, it's going to depend
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.760]   on things like your insulin sensitivity.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.440]   So for instance,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.560]   if you're somebody who gets up in the morning,
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.900]   hydrates and goes out for a six mile run,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.720]   you could probably eat a jar of almond butter
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.000]   and still be what's called fat fasted.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.900]   Your insulin levels will still be very low
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.660]   because even though that is a large volume of almond butter,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.300]   even to me and Costello,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.360]   that large number of calories come from a source
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.520]   that doesn't increase blood sugar very much
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.540]   and insulin very much.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.460]   Now, I'm not suggesting you do that,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.260]   but what I just described is a vastly different situation
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.060]   than somebody that ate their last meal at 2 a.m.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.580]   and that meal was essentially a feast.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.280]   And for that person,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.040]   fasting until 10 or 11 a.m.,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.800]   their blood sugar might still actually be pretty high
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.680]   or even low-ish such that they might eat one almond
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   and it would bump them out of fasting.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.520]   So you get the idea.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   It's going to depend on your recent eating history,
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.080]   your blood sugar history,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.280]   your glycogen stores, et cetera.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.920]   So if anyone tells you that breaks a fast or that doesn't,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.740]   that's kind of silly.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.760]   Would one grain of sugar break your fast?
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.600]   No.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.720]   Would an entire tablespoon of sugar break your fast?
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.560]   Yes.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.540]   You'll get a big blip in blood sugar and insulin from that.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.160]   However, how long that lasts,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.540]   how long it breaks your fast
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.080]   will depend on how glycogen depleted you are
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.780]   and a number of other factors.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.200]   So for me, I just keep it fairly simple.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   I ingest water, caffeine from yerba mate and guayusa,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.660]   and I drink my athletic greens with some lemon juice in it.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.940]   That constitutes my fasting.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.420]   And there are days when I do all those things.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.100]   There are days when I do none of those things.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.060]   Although most days,
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.840]   I would say about 355 days out of the year,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.780]   I'm ingesting water, caffeine, and athletic greens
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.720]   during this period of fasting early in the day.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.440]   And that's the period of time when I do my work.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.500]   One interesting fact about yerba mate and guayusa teas
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.860]   is that they increase release of something called GLP-1.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.000]   GLP-1 is related to glucagon.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.920]   Glucagon is a hormone that you can sort of think about
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.200]   as opposite to insulin and blood sugar.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.360]   It's more complex than that,
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.240]   but GLP-1 has a couple of positive properties.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.200]   One is it increases lipolysis
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.780]   and mobilization of body fat stores, so burning of fat.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.600]   In fact, there are now a number of clinical trials
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.820]   that are achieving good success,
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.100]   and there are drugs out there,
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.620]   only available by prescription, which mimic GLP-1
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.280]   and are being used to treat, quite successfully,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.740]   certain types of diabetes and obesity.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.680]   Now, I'm not diabetic,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.920]   nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.800]   but I figure as long as I'm fasting,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.160]   and as long as I like yerba mate and guayusa,
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.760]   which I do, they're delicious,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.300]   I'll tell you which type I use in a moment,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   I might as well increase my GLP-1
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.400]   because it's probably not as good as getting out
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.720]   and doing some cardio work.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.640]   But nonetheless, if I'm fasted,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.560]   increasing GLP-1 in my system,
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.120]   I'm going to be alert from the caffeine,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.800]   the adrenaline, et cetera,
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.920]   and I'm going to be burning body fat while I'm doing my work.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.320]   So for me, it's just an efficient biochemically rational,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.240]   or I should say grounded in quality biochemistry
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.120]   sort of approach.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.440]   Yerba mate comes in a lot of different forms.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.120]   There are a lot of different brands out there, et cetera.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.840]   I don't have any relationship whatsoever
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.360]   in a business sense to any of these brands.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.740]   Some of them are very smoky.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.760]   I, just because of something in my genetic makeup,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.320]   or I don't know, maybe it was some sort
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.480]   of Y chromosome associated lesion early in life,
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.040]   but I don't like smoky flavors.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.200]   So I'm not a Gouda cheese guy.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.420]   I don't like smoky stuff.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.160]   You may love it, but I tend to avoid smoky tasting mate's.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.020]   Instead, there's a particular brand
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.460]   that I just found on the internet called Anna Park.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.300]   I don't know Anna.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.320]   I don't know if she has a park,
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.080]   and I certainly don't know what Anna Park is,
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.200]   but for me, that's the best tasting Yerba mate.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.320]   Again, I don't have any relationship to them,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.920]   but it's affordable in the context of Yerba mate,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.560]   and it's the one that I use.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.700]   And I should mention along the lines of affordability
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.800]   and GLP-1 is there's a nice feature of Yerba mate,
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.160]   which is if you put it in a filter or a metal strainer
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.360]   and you pour hot water over it and then drink it,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.200]   keep the leaves.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.260]   The Yerba mate leaves can be used over and over again.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.200]   It seems that the GLP-1 stimulating aspects of mate
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.640]   actually are enhanced with subsequent pour overs.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   So there's something interesting about these teas
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.600]   that my tea aficionado friends tell me allows the tea
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.900]   to release more of some of the beneficial compounds
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.640]   by reusing the tea leaves.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.900]   Now, eventually it'll grow mold
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.040]   and other sorts of disgusting things.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.460]   You don't really want to run that experiment.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.400]   I would say you can use it for a day or two
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.720]   before it starts to go bad,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.540]   but that's a feature that will extend the life
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.040]   of whatever Yerba mate you happen to use
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.840]   if you decide to use it, and that's certainly what I do.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.520]   Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.080]   while I'm drinking all this Yerba mate,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.600]   'cause I'm not just sitting there thinking about
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.080]   all the GLP-1 circulating in my system.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.560]   I'm working.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.920]   A couple of things for optimizing workspace
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.440]   that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.820]   I've talked before about the fact that
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.920]   when our eyes are directed upward,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.800]   literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there,
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.760]   and when our eyes are directed upward,
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.720]   it creates a state of heightened alertness.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.920]   And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.360]   that create alertness and their control
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.320]   over the muscles of the eye and, believe it or not,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.920]   the eyelids.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.980]   Now, it's not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.560]   and you need to feel more alert,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.040]   that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.960]   although it will help support your levels of alertness.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.920]   The point here is that you can optimize your workstation
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.600]   in a physical way that leverages this aspect
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.720]   of the visual system and your level of alertness.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.420]   Since most of us want to be awake while we're working,
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.520]   try and position your screen or your tablet,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.960]   whatever device you happen to be working on,
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.060]   at least at eye level and ideally slightly higher.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.120]   If you think about it, most people are not doing this.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.740]   Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.800]   or are angling their eyes at their screen
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.200]   at about 30 degrees.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.920]   That is not going to support heightened states of alertness
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.480]   and optimal attention.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.360]   In fact, the opposite relationship between eye position
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.560]   and alertness is also true.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.100]   When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed,
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.160]   it tends to decrease our levels of alertness
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.240]   and increase our levels of sleepiness.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.600]   I really want to emphasize this,
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.680]   that there's a bi-directional or reciprocal relationship
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.000]   between the brainstem areas that control alertness
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.280]   and the eyes, meaning how alert you are controls
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.080]   how open or closed your eyes are, no surprise there,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.540]   but also that how open and upward directed your eyes are
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.780]   will increase your levels of alertness.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.320]   And if your eyes are pointed downward
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.780]   and your eyelids are hooded, like they're slowly closing,
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.400]   like Costello's always are, you'll feel more sleepy,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.560]   especially if you're somebody who tends to have
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.760]   that mid-morning sleepiness or mid-morning crash.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.840]   So what I do is I have a standing desk,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.080]   but I also prop the computer up
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.760]   such that it's at least at eye level.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   And I haven't figured out yet how to develop a workstation
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.180]   where the computer is above me.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.780]   I think the only way to really do that
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.900]   is actually to tilt one's body back,
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.320]   but actually that's not a good idea either.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.160]   They have done studies recording from areas of the brain
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.720]   associated with alertness, areas like locus coeruleus
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.840]   and the so-called reticular activating system.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.880]   They found is that depending on how reclined you are
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.560]   or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.780]   and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.920]   So body posture and whether or not you're upright
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.800]   or reclining will impact your levels of alertness
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.820]   in the predictable ways.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.660]   And where you position your eyes,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.080]   whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.260]   looking up or directly forward or looking down
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.900]   will dictate whether or not you are feeling more alert
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.980]   or more sleepy respectively.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.160]   So try and arrange a workstation or a position of your body
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.660]   and your chair or your standing desk, whatever it is,
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.900]   that allows you to work with a heightened state
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.360]   of alertness.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.680]   This is really, really key for me
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   because I found that when I would sit down,
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.120]   not only would my hip flexors start to get sore,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.080]   I'd feel tight in the back, et cetera,
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.640]   but if I was staring down at my screen all day
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.080]   or even for short periods of the day,
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.440]   I would start to feel sleepy
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.680]   and I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.080]   I also thought maybe I needed glasses.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.280]   I do wear readers at night, but it was really a problem.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.200]   And simply by getting the screen directly in front of me
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.220]   at eye level, it's been completely transformative.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.440]   So we're now at the description of my day
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.280]   and these protocols in which I would do
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.940]   a 90-minute bout of work.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.140]   Now, why 90 minutes?
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.040]   Well, the brain is going through these 90 minutes,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.500]   so-called ultradian cycles
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.200]   throughout the entire day and night.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.360]   Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.100]   to being less alert and then back to alert again.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.640]   Here's how it works.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.320]   At the start of one of these 90-minute ultradian cycles,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.300]   my brain is not quite engaged
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.880]   in whatever it is I'm trying to do.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.900]   Oftentimes, I have things jumping into my mind.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.860]   I've got distractions, et cetera.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.480]   I'll talk about how to deal with those distractions
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.260]   in a moment, but I set a timer for 90 minutes
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.500]   and I try and get a strong bout of work done
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.960]   inside of that 90 minutes with the full understanding
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.800]   that the entire 90 minutes is not going to be uniform
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.440]   in terms of my ability of focus.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.260]   There will be kind of peaks and valleys within that,
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.040]   but that 90 minutes is about what the brain can handle
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.320]   in terms of a dedicated effort for high degree of focus.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.140]   Some people can push out a little bit further.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.280]   Some people can't handle more than 10 minutes,
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.840]   but that's what I'm striving toward.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.960]   You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.800]   if you are focused.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.240]   So how do you increase that focus
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.060]   and how do you use the timer feature?
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.560]   Well, you can combine those.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.280]   I use a program called Freedom.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.100]   It shuts me out of the internet completely.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.720]   So that means no checking the markets,
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   no checking social media, no checking the news,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.340]   no checking email, none of that.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.060]   I get a dedicated bout of work done.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.300]   I confess, I don't allow myself to go to the restroom
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.200]   in that period of time.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.480]   Here's an interesting little tip
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.920]   that's grounded in physiology.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.680]   You have a direct neural connection from your bladder
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.300]   to your brainstem areas that increase alertness.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.960]   This is why when you have to go to the bathroom,
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.640]   when you have to urinate, it is extremely agitating, right?
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.920]   It can be very, very agitating.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.980]   I'm not encouraging you to get so agitated
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.680]   by filling your bladder so much
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.040]   and resisting going to the bathroom
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.360]   that you are uncomfortable and can't focus.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.360]   But I generally will just drink liquids
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.520]   and work away and work away,
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.560]   and I won't walk away to go use the bathroom
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.740]   unless I absolutely have to.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.960]   Sort of odd that we're talking about this,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   but this is one way in which I've learned
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.400]   to funnel my attention into whatever it is I'm doing.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.240]   Because as you all know,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.000]   the moment you sit down to do some serious work
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.420]   and you flip off the internet,
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.680]   all of a sudden it's as if the phone has a voice.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.520]   It starts calling you.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.980]   It's almost as if the restroom has a voice.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.900]   But we all are familiar with the fact
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.280]   that if we are focused on something,
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.800]   all that just kind of melts away.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.940]   So the goal is to get into what I call the tunnel,
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.600]   to really get into a tunnel of quality work.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.620]   The brain loves that state,
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.440]   but it's very hard for many of us to access.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.720]   My phone is absolutely off.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.880]   It's not on airplane mode.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.640]   It's absolutely off during this time.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.480]   If I've been struggling with that,
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.920]   and I confess, there are times when for whatever reason,
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.040]   something going on in life,
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.080]   it's been harder to put away the phone.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.880]   I will sometimes put it in my car.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.300]   I used to joke that I used to throw it up on the roof
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.360]   or something like that.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.400]   Look, I've done and I suggest people do whatever they need to
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.440]   in order to self-regulate that activity.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.660]   And if you're somebody that feels that you absolutely
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.340]   need to be on your phone and on the computer
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.100]   for this work bout or the work that you do,
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.440]   well, that's a different matter altogether.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.000]   This is just simply how I work.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.160]   So I will do 90 minutes,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.700]   and I do set a timer and I turn on the program freedom,
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.640]   locks me out of the internet.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.680]   If someone rings on the doorbell,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.740]   I will often shout not coming to the doorbell,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.580]   leave it there.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.720]   I mean, unless there's a real emergency,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.800]   I'm not going to step away from that work.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.280]   I learned how to do this when I was a graduate student
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.600]   under different conditions where I used to slice brains
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.040]   on what's called a microtome.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.400]   So I used to spend time just cutting very thin slices.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.440]   It's like a deli slicer,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.200]   but for a brain of various types of brains
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.960]   and I've sectioned through a lot of brains.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.040]   And we had a rule,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.440]   which is that when the blade hits the brain,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.900]   you don't stop pulling, even though it's very, very slow,
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.400]   even if a nuclear bomb goes off,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.760]   even if a fire alarm goes off.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.880]   Now, I don't want anyone burning to a crisp
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.480]   because they didn't step away from their workflow.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.320]   That would be foolish.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.920]   But that's the mentality that I've embedded in myself,
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.640]   that there's nothing more important
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.940]   than what I'm doing in that 90 minute block.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.840]   And that's what works for me.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.400]   You can try various other things.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.040]   That's what works for me.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.880]   In addition, I use low-level white noise.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.640]   This is something that is supported
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.860]   by quality peer-reviewed data.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.340]   We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance,
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.560]   but it turns out that white noise,
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.120]   which is essentially all frequencies of sound,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.560]   or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive,
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.200]   mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.120]   turned on at a low volume,
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.480]   not with headphones most of the time,
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.160]   puts the brain into a state
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.700]   that's optimal for learning and workflow.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.720]   And I covered two papers during that episode,
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.560]   one that showed that indeed,
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.420]   brain area is involved in attention,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.320]   brain area is involved in focus and cognition and memory.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.800]   Those are engaged to a greater degree
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.400]   when there is low levels of white noise
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.680]   playing in the background.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.440]   The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.700]   and showed that areas of the brain
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.840]   that are associated with dopamine release
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.600]   are increased by low levels of white noise.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.640]   Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure,
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.920]   but with motivation and craving.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.800]   So everything about this 90-minute block
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.200]   from the low levels of white noise
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.880]   to the position of my computer, how I'm standing,
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.920]   where my eyes are positioned,
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.760]   is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   And I have to say that while it can be a challenge
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.560]   to try and achieve this state and this tunnel of work,
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.480]   some days you start to get kind of addicted to it.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.900]   It feels really good.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.360]   It's like a workout for the mind.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.920]   And it is something that as you exit that 90 minutes,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.080]   you really feel like you've accomplished a lot
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.940]   because often you have,
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.020]   and it just feels deeply satisfying.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.340]   And I'm convinced that that's because of the release
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.980]   of neuromodulators like dopamine
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.740]   and the norepinephrine that's circulating in your system.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.760]   And I want to be clear
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.820]   that I'm not perfect about this 90 minutes.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.500]   Occasionally, I get drawn away.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.860]   Occasionally, something will happen
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.120]   or I'll go use the restroom
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.180]   or Costello will have a need
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.220]   or somebody will have a need that I will have to respond to.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.860]   But I really try and achieve this
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.280]   most if not every day that I'm alive
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.580]   because for me, that work session is kind of holy.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.680]   It's where I set up a relationship,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.400]   not just between me and the work that I'm doing,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.900]   but between me and my ability to control
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.860]   my own state of mind using these various supports
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.120]   of the white noise, et cetera.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.760]   But really, those supports are peripheral
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.580]   to the fact that I'm creating this space.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.560]   I'm funneling my brain into a state
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.860]   rather than allowing whatever events
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.340]   and contexts on social media and elsewhere
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.460]   might be occurring in the world
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.640]   that would yank me out of what for me is my purpose
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.520]   and my mission in life,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.420]   which is to do the sorts of work that I do.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.080]   There's a powerful way in which you can place the timing
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.400]   of this 90-minute workout in an optimal way.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.260]   You have access to a very important piece of data
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.580]   that dictates when this bout should start, more or less,
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.740]   and when it should end.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.660]   That piece of data is your temperature minimum.
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.840]   If you're somebody who wakes up on average at 7 a.m.,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.680]   well, then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.420]   And you can be reasonably sure,
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.460]   I won't underscore reasonably,
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.720]   but you can be reasonably sure that your best work
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.580]   is going to be done anywhere from four to six hours
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.300]   after your temperature minimum.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.940]   So for me, I tend to wake up around 6.30 a.m.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.960]   That means my temperature minimum is at 4.30 a.m.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.060]   You can add five hours to that.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:19.840]   So that means that a 90-minute workout could fall at 9.30 a.m.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.420]   and it would be fairly optimized.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.860]   Or I could do it at 10.30 a.m.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.500]   Or I could do it at 8.30 a.m., somewhere in there.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.700]   We can't say that it's exactly six hours
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.720]   after your temperature minimum.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.220]   You will find it, however,
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.940]   there is a precise and best time
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.660]   for you to do this 90-minute workout.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.020]   Whether or not it's five or six hours
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.060]   after your temperature minimum
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.120]   is going to vary from person to person.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   How do I know this?
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.120]   How do I know this relationship
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.900]   between temperature minimum and focused cognition?
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.420]   Well, temperature minimum defines the trough,
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:56.300]   the nadir, as they say, of your temperature
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.740]   across the 24-hour cycle.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.520]   And immediately after that,
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.900]   your temperature will start to rise.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.580]   That temperature rise is actually what triggers
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.420]   the initial cortisol release that you experience
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.700]   and wakes you up further.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.680]   And then, of course, that sunlight that you're getting
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.120]   is going to further enhance that healthy release of cortisol.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.380]   That cortisol will then provide fuel, if you will,
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.840]   for that increase in temperature.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.420]   And your body will continue to increase in temperature
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.940]   throughout the day toward the afternoon.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.220]   What you're trying to do in this idea
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.740]   of optimizing this 90-minute workout
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.980]   to a particular time of day
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.700]   is catch the portion of the steepest slope
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.300]   of that temperature rise.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.180]   Now, again, you're not walking around
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.100]   with a thermocouple or a thermometer
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.920]   in some orifice of your body,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.620]   so you don't have accurate information about temperature,
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.540]   but you can make very good guesses
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.980]   about when your body temperature is rising fastest
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.540]   by virtue of that temperature minimum.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.540]   So again, just to be clear, it's a 90-minute workout.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.040]   That's about what the brain can handle
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.780]   for a very intense workout.
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.080]   Do understand, again, that there are going to be portions
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.920]   of that 90-minute that your brain is flickering
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.820]   in and out of focus,
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.700]   other portions where you're going to be entirely focused,
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.020]   that's entirely normal.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.300]   But when to place that 90-minute workout,
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.840]   when to start it and when to end it,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.780]   will depend on that temperature minimum.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.300]   So if you're somebody who wakes up at 8 a.m. each morning,
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.180]   your temperature minimum is 6 a.m.,
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.020]   chances are you're going to want to start this workout
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:28.340]   somewhere around 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.060]   Now, some people wake up and feel very alert
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:31.900]   first thing in the morning.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.340]   They can really do their best work
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.760]   first thing in the morning.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.500]   Please, if that's you, continue to do that.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.020]   Leverage that time, use that time.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.380]   But if you're somebody who struggles to find focus,
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.380]   definitely let your physiology
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.400]   and this rise in your body temperature
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.680]   support your efforts to focus
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.520]   rather than trying to do your best work at times of day
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.460]   when your physiology is actually directing your body
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.980]   and your brain toward defocus
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.420]   and towards being more lethargic.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.940]   It just is setting yourself up for success
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.100]   when you try and capture this rising phase
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   of your temperature.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.080]   So up until now, we've been emphasizing practices
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.620]   that allow you to optimize your level of alertness
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.540]   and your levels of mental focus.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:20.260]   Data going back to the 1990s supports the idea
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.120]   that physical movement of particular kinds
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.420]   can support brain health and brain function,
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.580]   both in the immediate term and in the longterm.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.620]   Now, this is at a profound impact
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.360]   on the field of neuroscience,
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   but frankly, it's also at a profound impact
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.140]   on how I structure my day.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.300]   So after I've finished a bout of work,
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.780]   this 90-minute bout of work,
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.940]   I force myself some days, other days I want to,
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.220]   but I force myself to do some sort of physical exercise
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.780]   that is going to be supportive of my brain health
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.820]   and brain function and organ health
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.900]   and bodily function in general.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.340]   So I just briefly want to touch on
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:58.640]   what the structure of that exercise looks like,
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.940]   how it's structured within the day
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.340]   and how it's structured across the weeks, in fact,
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.160]   based on the scientific data
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.040]   and what the scientific data say is best or optimal
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.220]   in order to promote longevity of the brain,
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.740]   ability to focus, as well as cardiovascular health
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.520]   and all the other things that we know exercise supports.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.980]   Now, there are various forms of physical activity
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.740]   or what we call exercise,
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.220]   but those can generally be batched into two categories.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.200]   First is strength and hypertrophy work.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.460]   So physical movements that are designed
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.640]   to make you stronger and/or make your muscles larger.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:37.180]   There's also endurance work,
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.580]   physical exercise and movements that are designed
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.940]   to allow you to do more work over time
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.980]   or to extend the amount of time that you can do work
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.340]   of any kind, both physical and mental.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.780]   And we did two full podcast episodes
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.440]   on the details and the science
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.860]   and the protocols related to these topics.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.540]   We did an episode on the science
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.720]   of strength and hypertrophy,
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.060]   of building strength and muscle building,
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.100]   and that included a lot of protocols.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.400]   And we did an episode on endurance,
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.260]   how to build any one or all of the four types of endurance,
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.880]   which are muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic,
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.700]   long-distance endurance, et cetera.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.140]   So if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols,
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.500]   please see those episodes.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.920]   However, right now, I just want to emphasize
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.460]   how the data impact my day and how I structure my day
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.020]   in a way that I can incorporate physical movement
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.340]   in a way that supports my brain and health.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.620]   Basically, after I finish that cognitive workout,
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.300]   that 90-minute workout,
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:41.100]   I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.700]   The data all point to the fact that working out hard
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.660]   for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.140]   because of the way that it raises cortisol,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.580]   and cortisol can be a good thing
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.820]   if it's appropriately timed
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.480]   and in the appropriate low levels,
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.180]   but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.980]   throughout the day or have big spikes
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.080]   of cortisol repeatedly.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.000]   So keeping workouts relatively short
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.680]   can definitely help with that.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.340]   And certainly if you're training hard,
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.980]   60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.340]   And for many people, including myself,
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.520]   45 minutes or 50 minutes is probably even more optimal.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.900]   The basic design of this physical exercise
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.500]   is that it be approximately 60 minutes.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.640]   So maybe 60 plus or minus 15 minutes
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.420]   should be well within the margins
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.140]   of keeping hormonal health proper and not going too long,
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.580]   nor making the workout so short that it's not beneficial.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.680]   And essentially what the data tell us
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.820]   is that in order to optimize cardiovascular
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.220]   and brain health and other systems of the body,
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.860]   we want to exercise at least five days per week.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.660]   I know that seems like a lot.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   It certainly is a lot for certain people.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.320]   Some of you, you compulsive exercisers might gasp
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.880]   at the idea of taking two days off.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.860]   I personally find that taking two full days off per week
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.140]   is actually both beneficial
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:59.660]   to my exercise training performance, as well as pleasant.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.900]   I like those rest days.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.060]   But essentially the structure of the exercise regimen
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.780]   that works for sake of supporting health
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.660]   is going to be one in which there's a three to two ratio,
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:14.540]   where for a 12 week period or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.460]   three of those five workouts per week
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.260]   emphasize strength and hypertrophy,
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.000]   and the other two emphasize endurance.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.600]   Then after 10 or 12 weeks,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.120]   one switches over to a 10 or 12 week regimen
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.720]   of doing a three to two ratio
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.840]   where you're prioritizing endurance work.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.940]   So primarily the sorts of workouts
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.780]   that are described in the endurance episode
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.500]   and those protocols and the other two days,
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.780]   you're focusing on strength and hypertrophy work
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.760]   merely to maintain strength and hypertrophy,
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.220]   to not lose the strength and hypertrophy that you've created.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.580]   And there are a lot of data now supporting the fact
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.860]   that maintaining muscular health and bone health
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.500]   is supported by resistance training,
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.980]   weight training of various kinds.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.500]   It can also be done with body weight
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.260]   if you don't have access to equipment.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.580]   And of course, that doing cardiovascular endurance work
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.500]   is very beneficial both to the muscles of the body,
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.300]   the organs of the body, but also to the brain.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.740]   Many of you have probably heard
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.020]   that doing physical exercise of various kinds
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.700]   can support the production of new neurons in the brain.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:18.180]   Frankly, those data are specific to research animals.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.900]   As far as we know, increases in neuron number
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.440]   are not supported by exercise in humans.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.140]   There's a little bit of data that supports
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.140]   that maybe a few neurons might get created
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.460]   by running or weightlifting
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.780]   or things of that sort in human beings,
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.700]   but there's still a host of other reasons
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.200]   to have this hour or so per day
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.980]   where one is doing physical exercise.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.320]   And those include increased blood flow to the brain.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.880]   Remember, the brain is an organ too.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.900]   It's the most metabolically demanding organ in your body,
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.340]   and it's receiving those metabolic factors.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.100]   It's receiving its fuels by way of vasculature,
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.960]   of blood vessels and capillaries and veins
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.300]   and things of that sort.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.060]   So movement is very crucial
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.020]   to get your brain to function properly.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.100]   Movement of various kinds is very important
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.060]   to get your brain to function properly.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.660]   Resistance training turns out to be as important
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.180]   as endurance training because of the way
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.540]   that it stimulates the release of particular hormones
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.580]   actually from bones, things like osteocalcin,
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.060]   which can positively impact brain function
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.560]   and can support the health of existing neurons
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.540]   as opposed to increasing the number of neurons.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.220]   Turns out increasing the number of neurons
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.980]   may not actually be as beneficial as we think.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.000]   It all sounds great.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.260]   More neurons, more neurons.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.380]   Certainly more neurons is better than fewer neurons
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.740]   and losing neurons,
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.560]   but incorporating new neurons into existing brain circuitry
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.640]   is actually very challenging for the brain to do.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.000]   I make sure that after that work about,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.200]   I get this one hour or so of exercise five days per week
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.900]   because of the ways that it supports my general health.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.320]   And there are now hundreds of studies supporting the fact
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.000]   that both endurance work and strength training
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.340]   or hypertrophy training done in combination,
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.340]   meaning not necessarily in the same workout,
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.040]   but done across the week is immensely beneficial
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.120]   for the production of things
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.220]   like brain-derived nootropic factor,
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.340]   for limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6,
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.660]   for promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.860]   provided that exercise is of the proper duration
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.120]   and that it's not so intense
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.020]   that you're actually creating damage
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.940]   to the various systems of the body.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.540]   Now, where is the threshold
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:33.420]   between optimal sub-threshold and detrimental?
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.020]   This is a complicated theme
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.660]   if we don't put some structure around it.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.020]   So let's put a little bit of structure around it.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.060]   We already said that about 60 minutes,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.940]   so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.040]   is going to be optimal for all these health benefits.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.980]   What about the structure of the actual workouts?
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:53.340]   Well, we need to address this issue of intensity.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.940]   A good rule of thumb based on the literature,
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.740]   and I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.260]   prior to the strength and hypertrophy
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.660]   in the endurance episodes,
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.380]   and the literature that's published
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.700]   in quality peer-reviewed journals
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.780]   really points to the fact that approximately 80%
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.540]   of the resistance training you do
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.820]   should be resistance training
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.540]   that doesn't go to what they call failure,
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.000]   where you can't actually move the resistance anymore.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.700]   The other 20% can be of the higher intensity
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.580]   to failure type training.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.500]   Now, with respect to endurance work,
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.380]   one can build up endurance
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.480]   without having to log long, long mileage
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.380]   or extensive mileage in the pool or by running,
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.780]   and that's because there are these other forms of endurance
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.300]   that can build up, for instance,
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.900]   the capillary beds within the muscles.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.820]   Building up the capillary beds within the muscles
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.940]   will allow more oxygen utilization within the muscles,
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.360]   and thereby will increase your endurance,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.200]   both of the muscles,
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.060]   but also will improve brain metabolism
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.140]   and the way that the heart functions
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.500]   of cardiovascular function.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   That 80/20 rule of less than failure and work to failure
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.360]   in the resistance exercise regime can be transported
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.300]   or translated to the endurance exercise portion
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.460]   by focusing on that thing that we're familiar with,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.300]   which is the burn.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.020]   When we're running hard or cycling hard,
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.820]   we'll experience a kind of burning of the muscles
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.980]   that's associated with the lactate system.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.140]   During the episode on endurance,
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.020]   I pointed out that that burn is not lactic acid.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.560]   Contrary to common belief, it is not lactic acid.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.620]   It's associated with lactate metabolism,
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.080]   and again, about 80% of the endurance work
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.020]   should not incorporate that so-called burn,
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.660]   but if 20% of that work or so,
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.140]   I should say approximately 20% of that work
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.040]   does include the so-called burning sensation,
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.440]   that burning sensation actually triggers the activation
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.820]   of release of certain compounds and molecules from glia,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.140]   this brain cell type that supports neuron health,
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.080]   and actually the lactate system
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.500]   is its own form of fuel for the brain,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.220]   and so there's increasing interest
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.440]   in generating the lactate or pushing past
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.460]   that lactate threshold for small portion,
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.340]   20% or so of endurance work
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.540]   in order to support brain health and function.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.080]   So what does this all look like as a protocol?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.660]   Well, as I mentioned before, this three to two ratio,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.160]   so maybe you spend 10 weeks or so or 12 weeks or so
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.620]   focusing mainly on endurance work,
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.780]   three workouts per week on endurance work,
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.060]   80% of those workouts, meaning 80% of the time
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.060]   you're below that burn threshold,
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:32.100]   you are not experiencing a burning sensation,
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.840]   but that for 20% of it, you are,
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.220]   that based on the scientific data
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.860]   should support lactate metabolism, brain health, et cetera,
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.380]   as well as cardiovascular health and oxygen utilization,
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.540]   all the forms of endurance that we're aware of,
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.060]   and then the other two workouts
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.660]   would involve resistance training,
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.860]   again, with this 80/20 split,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.420]   where 80% of the work is not to failure and 20% is,
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.980]   and then maybe after 10, 12 weeks, you switch,
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.820]   where you start emphasizing strength and hypertrophy work
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.860]   for three of the workouts
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.680]   and endurance work for two of the workouts.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.580]   Now, of course, some of you will be able to train
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.960]   six days a week, or you'll compulsively need to train
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.800]   seven days a week.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.680]   If you decide to do that, please be aware
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.740]   that this cortisol threshold is a real thing.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.820]   So for me, the three to two ratio works out perfectly
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.580]   'cause I like two full days off a week.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.540]   When I take those really depends on my schedule
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.380]   and how I'm feeling.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.440]   Sometimes it's two days in a row,
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.480]   sometimes they're interspersed throughout the week,
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.640]   but in reviewing the scientific literature
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.580]   for those two episodes of the podcast
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   and in talking to people who are really informed
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.160]   in the world of resistance training and endurance training
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.020]   and how that relates to brain health and body health,
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.480]   this seems to be the most rational and grounded protocol.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.980]   So that's the one that I follow.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.080]   So on any given day, I finish that work block and I train.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.400]   I do some sort of resistance or endurance training.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.940]   I put those on alternate days or different days rather.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.340]   So we've now talked about the arc that spans
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:00.340]   all the way from waking to a morning bout of focused work
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.320]   to physical training.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.840]   I have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutrients.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.160]   One of the most common questions I get
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.220]   are what should I eat for my brain?
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.820]   Well, ironically enough, one of the best things
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.780]   you can do for your brain is to not eat.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.980]   But of course we all have to eat sooner or later
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.140]   and eating is wonderful.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.460]   I absolutely love eating.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.100]   I even enjoy the mere act of chewing.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.260]   But the question of what to eat is an important one
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.460]   as it relates to brain health and brain function.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.980]   Before we talk about that,
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:33.260]   I want to emphasize that training fasted
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.060]   actually has some immediate and long-term benefits.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   Prior to having my lab at Stanford,
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.660]   I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.660]   and had an appointment
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.980]   at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.180]   I had a colleague there by the name of Sachin Panda.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.660]   He wrote a wonderful book called "The Circadian Code."
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.140]   He runs a serious biology laboratory
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.300]   focusing on metabolism, circadian rhythms, and so forth,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.360]   as well as the effects of fasting.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.080]   Sachin and his book, "The Circadian Code,"
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.300]   describe how engaging in physical exercise while fasted
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.660]   can amplify the effects of that exercise,
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.100]   not just for sake of increasing the percentage
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.320]   of things like body fat burned, et cetera,
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.840]   but for cellular health, liver health,
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.820]   and the health of other organs.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.800]   So where possible, I do strive to do my workout
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.840]   without eating anything first.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.060]   However, some days I'm very, very hungry,
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.860]   and so I do ingest water, which contains electrolytes.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.100]   So that means sodium, magnesium, potassium,
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.560]   for the simple reason that sodium, magnesium, potassium
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.820]   are required for neurons to function properly.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.860]   It's part of the way they generate electrical activity.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.160]   As well, ingesting electrolytes, for me, can quell hunger.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.240]   And this points to a whole other topic
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.120]   we could do another episode on at some point,
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.040]   which is many times people will think
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.340]   that their blood sugar is low,
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.400]   and actually, that's not the case.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.380]   And frankly, one wouldn't want their blood sugar to be high.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.200]   You don't want your blood sugar too low,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.040]   but you also don't want it too high.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.200]   Very low blood sugar is terrible,
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.120]   but low-ish blood sugar tends to give us
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.200]   a sense of mental clarity and focus
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.520]   related to this adrenaline phenomenon
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.300]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.880]   In order to be able to focus on exercise or work
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.840]   or anything else, you need sufficient electrolytes.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.840]   And so many people find that if they
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.120]   simply ingest some water with salt,
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.480]   maybe a 99-milligram potassium tablet,
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.760]   all of a sudden they feel very mentally clear
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.320]   and able to do physical work and mental work.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.360]   So what I do is prior to this morning exercise,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.840]   although it's now late morning in this way I'm describing it
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.920]   and typically it does occur late morning,
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.160]   I'll have some water with either,
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.880]   so maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.560]   with a 99-milligram potassium tablet,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.480]   or these days I'm fond of taking what's called Element,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.840]   LMT, Element.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.640]   I learned about this from Lex Friedman's podcast.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.240]   I know many of you are familiar with Lex.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.260]   He's an excellent podcast, excellent scientist.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.520]   I don't have any business relationship to Element.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.280]   They're not a sponsor of the podcast,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.300]   but Element is a product that essentially contains
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.840]   electrolyte, sodium, potassium,
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.400]   as well as magnesium malate,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.240]   which has been shown to offset things
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.160]   like delayed onset muscle soreness.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.520]   That form of magnesium doesn't make people drowsy.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.480]   It's not an anxiolytic like some other forms of magnesium.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.320]   An anxiolytic is just one that reduces anxiety.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   So whether or not it's Element
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.960]   or whether or not you're just putting a little bit of salt
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   into some water and ingesting that prior to training,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.440]   that can be an excellent way to ensure
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.400]   that you're able to complete the physical exercise,
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.940]   even though you haven't eaten anything.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.800]   And I confess some days I will eat a little bit
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.440]   before my workout just because I can't seem to resist eating.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.520]   I want to mention the use of stimulants
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.800]   before physical training.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.120]   This has certain benefits and certain drawbacks.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.540]   The benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.560]   because things like caffeine
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.320]   can increase the release of dopamine,
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.200]   can increase the release of epinephrine,
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.480]   can reduce that adenosine level in the bloodstream.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.120]   So some people use caffeine before training
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.320]   in ways that benefit them.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.060]   It can also increase fat oxidation and kind of fat metabolism
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.360]   and things if that's your goal.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.020]   I am not a particular fan of ingesting stimulants
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.120]   before training because of a whole set of problems
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.680]   associated with most forms of stimulants
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.360]   in the form of energy drinks, et cetera.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.760]   I am not a fan of energy drinks.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.900]   I did a decent portion of a previous episode
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.600]   on food and mood on energy drinks
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.980]   and some of the detrimental things they contain.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.420]   Rather, I try and train simply by ingesting
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.300]   the caffeine sources I mentioned before,
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.540]   guayusa, mate, some electrolytes, some water.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.660]   Occasionally I'll have an espresso or a cup of coffee
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.740]   before I train.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:51.460]   And on rare occasions, I should emphasize rare occasions,
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.140]   if I really need help increasing my motivation
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.260]   or I decide I want to push extremely hard,
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.580]   I will ingest something like alpha-GPC.
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.980]   Alpha-GPC supports the release of a neuromodulator
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:05.020]   called acetylcholine, so 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.460]   has been shown to increase physical performance,
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.280]   but also cognitive performance.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.840]   Some people might not be interested in ingesting anything
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.080]   to improve their physical performance or anything at all,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.820]   but they might be addressing
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:18.380]   how they can improve cognitive performance and focus.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:21.320]   And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant way to approach that.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.000]   Again, definitely check with your doctor
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.580]   before taking anything or stopping to take anything,
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.420]   but alpha-GPC has been shown in various studies
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.020]   to improve cognitive performance
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.480]   and in people who have age-related cognitive decline,
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.420]   there have been some positive benefits reported
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.740]   in quality peer-reviewed journals.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.780]   If you want to explore those references,
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:44.140]   please go to examine.com, please put in alpha-GPC,
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.660]   go to the Human Effect Matrix,
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   and there you can find details of those studies,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.620]   references to PubMed, et cetera.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.980]   So let's talk about food timing first.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.300]   As I mentioned, I eat my first meal sometime around noon,
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.160]   plus or minus an hour for the reasons we've discussed.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.780]   The volume of food is also important.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.480]   If you eat a large volume of anything,
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.280]   because it diverts blood to your gut,
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.800]   you will feel lethargic
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.560]   and you will have less blood going to your brain.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.400]   That seems like a simple and trivial fact,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.480]   but if you want to be able to think,
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.820]   you can't ingest large volumes of anything into your gut.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.840]   So the discussion about what foods give you energy
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.520]   is kind of moot if you eat enormous volumes of that food.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.100]   Now, the volumes are going to depend on you
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.780]   and your needs and your activity levels.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.280]   I'm going to discuss what I do in terms of food content,
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.000]   but I'm not going to discuss food volume.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.660]   I sort of know where that mostly full, like 80% full line is
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.120]   and I usually eat a little bit past that, frankly.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.480]   And I'm able to maintain a decent degree of alertness
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.440]   into the afternoon.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.280]   And that's my goal.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.800]   And I think that's the goal of most people
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.640]   to not work out in the morning or do some work
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.280]   and then just collapse into a slumber
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.340]   that lasts all afternoon,
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:02.440]   but to be able to generate alert, calm, focused states
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.020]   throughout the day.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:08.300]   So for lunch, I do emphasize slightly lower carbohydrate
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.580]   or low carbohydrate intake for the simple reason
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.460]   that adrenaline and dopamine
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.840]   and their associated neuromodulators
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.960]   are going to support alertness.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.740]   So for me, I fast up until about noon.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.800]   Then I eat a lunch that consists of some sort
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.600]   of protein thing, like some meat or some chicken
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.720]   or some salmon and some vegetables, et cetera.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.700]   And if I've exercised previously,
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.140]   which I do, as I mentioned, five days a week,
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.040]   then I will ingest some starches.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.200]   I'll ingest some bread, excuse me, or rice
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.000]   or oatmeal and butter and nuts and things like that.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.340]   I will consume the various food groups, as they say,
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.520]   but I will keep the total amount of carbohydrate
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.120]   a little bit on the low side.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.640]   Or if I haven't trained, I won't have any carbohydrate
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.680]   at all, not because I'm ketogenic,
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.640]   not because I'm anti-carbohydrate,
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.600]   not because I'm on a pure carnivore diet, far from it,
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.600]   but because starches cause the release of serotonin
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.000]   in the brain and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.840]   Now, I should mention that about 25% of individuals
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.020]   have genes that encode for enzymes that allow them
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.160]   to eat large amounts of carbohydrate
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.240]   and not suffer from this lethargy,
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.500]   this kind of sedation from carbohydrates,
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.780]   but I don't have that gene.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:34.300]   And so for me, eating a noon-ish meal
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.620]   that is not enormous, but is decent in size,
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.920]   but that is mainly protein, healthy fats,
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.140]   and low-ish carbohydrates or no carbohydrates
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.600]   is what allows me to achieve heightened states of alertness
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.800]   throughout the day, which is what I need for my purposes.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.280]   So just knowing that meats and nuts support alertness,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.960]   provided you don't eat too much of them,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.880]   that vegetables are healthy for us
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.360]   and therefore we should eat them,
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.880]   and I happen to like them as well,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.680]   and that carbohydrates tend to have
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.080]   a kind of sedative-like quality to them,
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.280]   that should help you kind of guide your food choices
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.960]   in an intelligent way that's grounded
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.860]   in the scientific literature as it relates to alertness.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.900]   Now, what about components of foods
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.480]   that are not about alertness, but are about mood?
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.720]   We did an entire episode on mood and food,
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.480]   and it's very clear based on now dozens of studies
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.480]   that ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.900]   is going to support healthy mood
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.820]   and even can act as an antidepressant.
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.880]   More than a dozen studies have shown
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.200]   that ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams per day
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.700]   of the EPA form of essential fatty acid
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.520]   is as effective as prescription antidepressants
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.200]   in relieving depression.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.100]   And if you're somebody
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.520]   who requires prescription antidepressants,
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.400]   Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.960]   it can allow people to take lower doses
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.880]   of those medications, which in many cases
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.520]   is a positive thing or a good thing to do
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.220]   because of the side effect profiles
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:04.880]   that many of those drugs carry.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.520]   So I find these data remarkably compelling.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.640]   I mean, here we have a food or a substance from food
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.720]   that can improve our mood and our sense of wellbeing,
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.160]   and it does that by way of increasing
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.620]   certain neuromodulators in the brain,
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:20.760]   in particular dopamine,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.160]   but also some other related neuromodulators.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.440]   So if you're eating fatty salmon regularly,
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.840]   if you're eating krill regularly,
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.560]   meaning if you're a whale,
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.400]   if you're ingesting foods
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.240]   that tend to have a lot of omega-3s,
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.980]   you probably don't need to supplement with omega-3.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:42.820]   Most people are not ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3s,
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.880]   and I'm certainly one of those people.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.360]   Despite an effort to eat good foods
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.120]   and whole foods, et cetera, and unprocessed foods,
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.480]   I've made the choice to ingest
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.760]   at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.080]   I do that in the form of fish oil
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.640]   and the EPA/DHA combination fish oil.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.160]   But the threshold of 1,000 milligrams
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.280]   is not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil,
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.680]   it's 1,000 milligrams of EPA.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.480]   Now, for those of you that don't want to consume fish oils
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.080]   and prefer to get your omega-3s from non-animal sources,
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.500]   there are non-animal sources,
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.000]   various forms of algae, et cetera.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.840]   You can just look that up online
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.020]   and you should be able to find that.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.480]   There are also a number of foods
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.640]   that include these essential omega-3s.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.260]   We did an episode on food and mood
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.520]   where I go into more detail than you could ever want on that
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.440]   as well as some additional recommendations.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.580]   We also did an episode on thyroid function,
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.980]   this hormone that's important for metabolism,
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.160]   and that pointed to the importance
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.700]   of getting sufficient iodine,
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.200]   which you should naturally get
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.520]   from the salts you're ingesting
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.220]   provided you're ingesting enough salt.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:47.000]   I'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp or seaweed,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.380]   although I don't mind the taste of seaweed,
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.000]   I don't ingest it regularly,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.560]   but ingesting sufficient selenium or selenium
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.080]   has been shown to be important
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.300]   for proper thyroid production, thyroid function,
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.160]   which is why I tend to eat a few Brazil nuts each day,
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.720]   typically with my lunch or sometimes before my workout,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.820]   doesn't really matter.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:10.400]   The point is that the volume, the amount, the content,
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.440]   and indeed the ratios of protein to fat to carbohydrates
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.920]   are going to impact how you feel,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.260]   and they're going to impact your brain health.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.600]   And of course, the timing.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.520]   We know that allowing periods of 12 hours or more
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.980]   each 24-hour cycle where you're not ingesting anything
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.680]   is beneficial for your brain and body health.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.640]   That's what Sachin Panda and his colleagues' work
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.020]   has shown over and over again in these quality studies.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.980]   So when people ask me, "What should I eat for my brain?"
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.660]   More often than not, it's really a question
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.140]   of how you're structuring your day,
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.660]   when you're eating for the first time,
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.400]   how long you're allowing yourself to fast
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.020]   each 24-hour cycle, and also whether or not
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.420]   you're getting sufficient omega-3s,
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.920]   whether or not you're getting sufficient selenium
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.420]   to support things like thyroid function,
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.660]   which has an impact both on the metabolism of the body,
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.420]   but also the metabolism in the brain.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.300]   And when I say metabolism, I don't just mean burning energy.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.440]   I actually mean the rebuilding of things.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.380]   So in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone,
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.680]   we talked about how metabolism means not just the breakdown
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.060]   of fats and carbohydrates, but also the building up,
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.240]   the repair of muscle tissue, the repair of bone,
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.820]   the reinforcing of bone, and the repair
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.100]   and the buildup of brain tissue.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.220]   And so those are the things that I emphasize
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.080]   because they're so strongly supported
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   by the scientific data done in mice, studies done in humans.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.380]   And basically, there's a lot of biochemical evidence
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.620]   that supports everything that I just described.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.200]   Along the lines of health and wellbeing,
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.100]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention hormones.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.340]   Hormones have broad effects on the body and brain.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.280]   We did an entire month on hormones.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.740]   If you want to hear about any of those hormones in detail,
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:53.820]   we talked about testosterone
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.320]   and optimizing testosterone, estrogen, et cetera.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.060]   The sex steroid hormones,
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.500]   which include testosterone and estrogen,
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.500]   which of course are present in varying ratios,
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.900]   but in both men and women and in kids,
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.500]   they are manufactured from cholesterol.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.360]   We hear about cholesterol as this terrible thing,
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.160]   but they are actually made from cholesterol.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.820]   And so if you don't get sufficient levels of cholesterol,
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.480]   that can be problematic for your hormones
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.780]   and that can be problematic
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:25.500]   for your brain and your body health.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.340]   So without going into too much detail,
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.680]   I'll just point to a couple of things that I do
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.300]   that at least from my blood work
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.740]   and from my subjective experience
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.140]   have been very beneficial for me
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.860]   that some of you might want to consider.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.780]   First of all, I'm not shy about my love for butter.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.820]   I will eat pats of butter directly.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.140]   I believe if people are going to eat cheese
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.840]   without a cracker, I will eat butter without a cracker.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.060]   Butter is high in cholesterol, so I don't eat a ton of it,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.200]   but at least for me and for my lipid profiles, it's fine.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.500]   Butter has cholesterol,
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.620]   which is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.320]   and men and women need testosterone and estrogen
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.700]   in order to feel good and to be able to think.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.180]   You do not want your estrogen too low
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.820]   or your testosterone too low.
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.840]   So I eat butter in order to ensure
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.100]   that I get sufficient cholesterol.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.920]   Butter also has some other things that are beneficial,
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.700]   various small fatty acids that are interesting
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.780]   in terms of their effects on metabolism, et cetera.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.880]   You can look those up, the benefits of butter.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.420]   But again, volume is important and you can't overdo it.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.580]   Costello incidentally loves butter as well.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.380]   Along the lines of hormones and testosterone,
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.180]   get a lot of questions about this, I think,
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.060]   because a lot of online communities
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.840]   are sort of obsessed with testosterone.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.540]   And I just want to emphasize that yes,
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.040]   having sufficient levels of testosterone
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.380]   is vitally important for brain function
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.560]   and having sufficient levels of estrogen
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.100]   will allow your brain to actually function.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.340]   It turns out that estrogen is one of the main ways
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.420]   in which the brain maintains longevity
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.540]   and maintains its ability to think.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.820]   So we should all be seeking optimal testosterone levels
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.260]   for ourselves, both testosterone and estrogen.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:11.440]   And many of the things that we've discussed up until now,
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.460]   morning sunlight, exercise, fasting,
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.640]   those can support testosterone and estrogen
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.700]   in meaningful and positive ways.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.440]   I get a lot of questions about hormone optimization.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.780]   We did an entire month on this topic.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.260]   We did an entire episode on testosterone
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.400]   and estrogen optimization.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.220]   I just want to briefly highlight two things
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.580]   that could be relevant.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.780]   And then if you want more details,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.940]   please go see that episode.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.700]   The first is that testosterone
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.620]   can exert its various functions
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.420]   only in its unbound form, free testosterone.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.460]   We all make a particular binding protein
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.860]   called sex hormone binding globulin
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.680]   that essentially binds up testosterone,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.320]   prevents it from being free.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.460]   This sounds like a terrible thing,
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.300]   but actually it's a good thing
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.420]   because it allows testosterone to be transported
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.300]   to the various tissues, including the brain,
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.960]   where it can exert its various functions.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:10.420]   For those that have lower than desired levels of testosterone
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.900]   or too much sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.120]   it turns out that 400 milligrams per day
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.880]   of something called tongkat ali,
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.980]   which is a form of ginseng,
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:21.160]   can actually help increase levels of free testosterone.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.900]   Many people experience a positive subjective effect
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.180]   and some objective effects as well,
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.160]   meaning increases in free testosterone
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.900]   when they do blood analysis.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.140]   There are some data on that,
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.060]   not a ton in the peer-reviewed literatures,
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:37.800]   and again, always approach these with a sense of caution
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.880]   and definitely talk to your doctor.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.100]   If you want to learn more about that,
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.420]   you can go to examine.com.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.060]   There's a lot of information there listed about that.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:48.180]   The other compound that's relevant both to men and women,
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.020]   or I should say people that are trying to optimize
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.620]   testosterone and/or estrogen is Fidogia.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:56.040]   Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.860]   that increases the levels of what's called
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:58.740]   luteinizing hormone.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.580]   Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's released
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.900]   from the hypothalamus within the brain
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.240]   that travels to the gonads,
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.980]   either the ovaries or the testes,
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.560]   to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.940]   And Fidogia agrestis has been shown,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.500]   albeit in a limited number of studies,
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.280]   to increase levels of luteinizing hormone
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.260]   and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.980]   in ways that some people find beneficial.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.160]   So I just want to mention those two.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.920]   And again, if you want a lot more information
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.720]   about hormone optimization,
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   please see the episodes on hormone optimization.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.560]   A key aspect to the midday meal,
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.960]   if you want that meal to benefit you,
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.520]   is to take a brief walk afterwards.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.360]   It turns out that brief walks of five to 30 minutes
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.320]   after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.360]   and actually can accelerate and improve nutrient utilization,
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.040]   which is essentially the same as metabolism.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.840]   But nonetheless, that's something that I do
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.800]   after I finish my noon meal.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.640]   I do force myself to stand up and go outside
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.620]   and take a brief walk.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.600]   That also gets me again into optic flow.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.840]   It also has another benefit,
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.160]   which is that I am giving my brain and thereby my body
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.600]   more information about light and time of day,
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.740]   which is always better than less information
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.200]   about light and time of day.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.920]   Much of our circadian rhythm and our health rhythms
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.540]   and all of our cognitive rhythms, et cetera,
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:25.080]   are supported by our cells knowing where they are in time.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.460]   And light is the primary zeitgeber,
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.200]   that's German for timekeeper,
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.960]   is the primary way in which the body learns information
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.620]   or about what function should be turned on
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.220]   and what function should be turned off.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.520]   So getting that morning light pulse,
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.400]   but then also leaving the house or apartment or workplace
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.960]   and getting out for a few minutes after lunch
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.600]   is beneficial for metabolism,
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.720]   beneficial for nutrient utilization,
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.480]   and beneficial for all the organs and tissues of the body
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.240]   because you're getting that outside light exposure.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.500]   Now I'd like to shift our attention
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.920]   towards science-supported protocols
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.160]   that increase the effectiveness
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.560]   and our performance in everything.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.320]   And by everything, I mean sleep,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.400]   I mean physical performance,
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.160]   I mean mental performance,
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.740]   I mean less anxiety, all the things, truly all the things.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:16.980]   And that is something called non-sleep deep rest.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.360]   Non-sleep deep rest or NSDR is an acronym that I coined
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.760]   as an umbrella term to encompass many protocols
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.100]   that all have been shown in one form or another
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.320]   to support better brain and body function.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.920]   Now these protocols have names that you've heard before,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.440]   things like meditation, things like yoga nidra,
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.060]   and things like hypnosis.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.160]   All of these protocols and these activities, however,
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.360]   share something in common,
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.840]   which is they involve a deliberate
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.720]   and directed shift in one state,
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.880]   and the shift tends to be toward
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.160]   a state of deeper relaxation.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.520]   We certainly don't have time now
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.000]   to dissect out the literature on all of these.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.800]   There is ample literature,
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.480]   I should say there is robust and ample literature
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.040]   supporting the fact that a regular meditation practice
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.960]   is beneficial, but meditation itself has many forms,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.400]   transcendental meditation, loving kindness meditation,
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.800]   third eye meditation, walking meditation.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.100]   Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked about
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.580]   many times before, which involves simply lying down.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.600]   It doesn't involve any movement,
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.200]   no down dogs or up dogs or anything.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.080]   It just involves lying on your back
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.440]   and doing some specific long exhale breathing.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.040]   There are a lot of yoga nidra scripts out there
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.040]   that are quite good, but there's one NSDR-type protocol
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.440]   that has been shown by the greatest number
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.200]   of scientific studies to promote
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.620]   not just states of deep relaxation,
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.360]   not just states of heightened focus,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.140]   but also to accelerate plasticity
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.080]   and learning within the brain, and that's hypnosis.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.880]   And I've become increasingly excited
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.200]   and interested in hypnosis as a tool
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.680]   and not just a tool of any kind,
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.600]   but a tool that really can be directed
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.760]   toward particular goals and outcomes.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.300]   And I think that's really what sets hypnosis apart
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.900]   as an NSDR, non-sleep deep breath protocol,
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.080]   from things like naps or things like yoga nidra
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.960]   or things like meditation.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.400]   And I certainly believe and understand
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.060]   that meditation naps and yoga nidra
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.760]   can be directed toward less anxiety, et cetera,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.760]   but hypnosis is unique in that it's very directed.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.920]   The essence of hypnosis is for the person, you,
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.020]   to guide your brain toward a particular outcome or change.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.940]   So I'd like to point out a particular resource.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:40.720]   It's a completely zero cost resource, which is reveri.com.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   That's R-E-V-E-R-I.com, reveri.com, obviously is a website,
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.160]   where there are links to an app
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.280]   that's available in Apple and Android.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.620]   This is a hypnosis app,
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.220]   but this isn't just any hypnosis app.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.720]   This is a hypnosis app
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.160]   that contains multiple hypnosis protocols
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.040]   that are all backed by very high quality science.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.160]   The science was done by my colleague
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.720]   and our associate chair of psychiatry
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.920]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.460]   That's David Spiegel is responsible for that work.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.720]   I'm not associated with that scientific work.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.440]   They've examined what brain areas
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.260]   get activated during hypnosis,
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.540]   what the outcomes are for various hypnosis protocols.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.860]   And within Reverie, you will find hypnosis protocols
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.800]   for enhancing your focus, enhancing creativity,
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.600]   reducing pain, getting better at sleeping, reducing anxiety.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.660]   Most of these are about 10 or 15 minutes long.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.060]   Some of them are extremely brief, one minute long.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.580]   They have a one minute hypnosis that you can do.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.920]   Those one minute hypnosis scripts work best
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.540]   if you've been doing the 10 and 15 minute ones
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.900]   regularly or semi-regularly.
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.560]   It's a really wonderful resource
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.980]   for which there is a lot of peer-reviewed published data.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.500]   One study I'd like to emphasize in particular
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.360]   is Jiang et al, J-I-A-N-G.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.520]   That is a reference you can find
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.600]   on the reverie.com website under our research.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   And the title of this paper is Brain Activity
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.800]   and Functional Connectivity Associated with Hypnosis.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.920]   And it was published in the journal Cerebral Cortex.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.800]   What this paper essentially shows
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   is that specific areas of our brain
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.820]   that are involved in executive function,
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.800]   which is associated with our ability to focus,
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.400]   as well as what's called the default mode network,
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.300]   which is sort of the way that your brain idles.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.300]   Does your brain tend to idle
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.780]   at a level of high anxiety or calm,
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.560]   as well as activation of a brain area
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.380]   called the insula, that's I-N-S-U-L-A.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.240]   The insula is extremely interesting.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.880]   Hypnosis has been shown to activate the insula,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.360]   which can enhance our sense of interoception,
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.320]   our sense of internal state,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.260]   which might sound like a annoying thing.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.480]   You don't want to be thinking about your heartbeat
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   or your breathing.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.880]   But what's really interesting about hypnosis
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.840]   is that it increases areas of the brain
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.780]   that are responsible for deep relaxation,
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.200]   focus, and self-awareness,
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.760]   this interoception, simultaneously.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.160]   And that's very unusual compared to other states
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.200]   and other states of any kind.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.480]   So I've made it a practice, a daily practice, in fact,
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.960]   that after lunch and after this walk,
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.960]   I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script,
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   because what I found is that in contrast to naps
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.220]   and in contrast to other forms of NSDR,
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.480]   it really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation,
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.240]   but also to then exit that state
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.000]   in a very focused and deliberate way
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.040]   that allows me to lean into my afternoon in an alert way,
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.960]   in a way that I can function and do mental work
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.400]   and interact with people, et cetera.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.880]   So there's no brain fog, there's no grogginess.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.600]   And I want to emphasize that the hypnosis
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.860]   that I'm referring to here and that Reverie provides
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.080]   is not stage hypnosis.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.640]   This isn't you being programmed to squawk like a chicken
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.800]   or do anything against your will.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.320]   This is you teaching your brain how to access
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.500]   these focused, relaxed, interoceptive states.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.040]   This is also an extremely valuable aspect to hypnosis
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.760]   because it can increase plasticity,
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.120]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.960]   It's essentially opening up pathways
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.980]   that allow you to change your brain
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.480]   in the ways that you want.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.880]   And it's very directed toward particular outcomes.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.160]   So I am an, as you can probably tell,
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.380]   I'm very enthusiastic about hypnosis
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:17.480]   as an optimal NSDR protocol.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   And so I do that every single day.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.260]   There are days that I don't manage to do it
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.840]   for whatever reason, I forget,
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.540]   or interference from email or et cetera,
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.720]   but that is essentially how I enter my early afternoon.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:33.560]   I do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.540]   in the form of a Reverie hypnosis.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.440]   Again, a completely zero-cost resource to you.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.960]   There are excellent data.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.840]   All those data can be found on the Reverie site.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.920]   And you can also learn a lot more about hypnosis
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.040]   and what sorts of hypnosis protocols
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.620]   might be optimal for you.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.800]   So if you are looking for a science-backed, zero-cost,
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:56.120]   very effective tool for getting better at focusing,
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.260]   better at sleeping, better at all the things
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.120]   that I believe people want,
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.860]   I do believe that is the best tool
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.980]   that one can access at this point in time.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.840]   So then after I exit hypnosis,
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.120]   usually give Costell a little scratch behind the ear,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.040]   and then I make sure that I hydrate.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:15.800]   Hydration, again, is vitally important for brain function.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.120]   It's vitally important for all bodily functions.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.720]   And I often forget to do it.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.240]   So I've just sort of linked the drinking of water
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.000]   to my hypnosis practice.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.680]   As soon as I'm done, I hydrate.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.440]   And then I tend to focus on another work bout.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.180]   So this would be, for me, sometime around 2.30
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.620]   or three o'clock in the afternoon,
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.500]   when normally I would be quite sleepy and passing out.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.080]   However, the protocol of shifting my morning caffeine
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.500]   to 90 minutes, two hours after waking,
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.280]   as well as the use of this hypnosis protocol
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.020]   has really allowed me to move through the afternoon
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.880]   in a way that I don't experience that dip in energy.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.920]   Every once in a while, I'll feel kind of sleepy
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.740]   or kind of out of it.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:59.640]   But I've been really pleasantly surprised
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.000]   at the extent to which one can avoid that afternoon dip
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.800]   if you do certain things properly
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.860]   prior to the arrival of two or three p.m.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.880]   Now, if you're a napper and you want to nap, no big deal.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.720]   Naps can be wonderfully beneficial.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.320]   Here are the rules around napping
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.560]   according to the sleep science.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.120]   Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.120]   I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.420]   my colleague in the Stanford Sleep Laboratory,
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.620]   as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley,
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.800]   whose name I'm sure most of you are familiar with,
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:29.020]   wrote this wonderful book, "Why We Sleep."
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.240]   Naps should be 90 minutes or less,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.460]   and 20-minute naps are fine,
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.120]   but not longer than 90 minutes.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.560]   And there are essentially two varieties of people,
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.720]   people for whom napping interferes
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.960]   with falling asleep later that night and staying asleep,
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.560]   and people for whom the nap does not interfere.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.160]   You have to decide who you are.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.660]   And if you're somebody who can nap
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.440]   and not have any trouble falling asleep and staying asleep
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.600]   later that night, well, by all means nap.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.860]   Just make it 90 minutes or less.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.860]   Again, these 90-minute cycles are really a vital constraint
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.480]   that we should all obey.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.340]   If it's 91 minutes, don't worry.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.940]   You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears,
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.820]   but if you're starting to sleep for an hour or more
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.140]   in the afternoon, that can be problematic.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:14.220]   If you're somebody who can nap for 10, 20 minutes,
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.380]   that's probably better than getting a full 90-minute cycle
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.940]   unless you didn't get enough sleep the night before.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.800]   But you really have to figure out what's right for you.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:22.860]   There's a lot of variety there,
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:25.300]   but that's essentially what the science says.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.880]   Now, whether or not you nap or whether or not you do not nap,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.800]   a key protocol for sleep health and wakefulness
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.360]   and metabolism and hormone health
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.520]   is viewing light in the afternoon.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.320]   So here's the reason for doing this.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.580]   As we progress into the evening hours,
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:47.140]   there's a phenomenon where our retina, our eyes,
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.360]   become very sensitive to light,
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.560]   such that if we view bright lights
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.780]   or even not-so-bright lights
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:58.600]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.300]   that is strongly disruptive, very disruptive,
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.860]   for our dopamine production.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:06.960]   It can really screw up our sleep.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.040]   And it's actually been shown in data
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.840]   from David Berson's lab at Brown University,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.560]   one of the foremost circadian biology laboratories,
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.540]   as well as Sami Tarr's laboratory
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:19.240]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.880]   that viewing bright light or even not-so-bright light
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.620]   between these hours of 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:29.360]   or even 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. can disrupt learning and memory,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.120]   can disrupt the immune system,
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.160]   and can disrupt mood in very long-lasting ways.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   There are ways to offset that, however,
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.200]   what I call your Netflix inoculation.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.360]   For those of you that like to stay up late on the tablet
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.720]   or computer or watching Netflix,
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.080]   getting a little bit of afternoon light in your eyes
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   somewhat counterintuitively can prevent this disruption
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.800]   of bright light later in the evening, at least somewhat.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.160]   What do I mean by that?
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.480]   Well, if you view light as the sun is starting to go down,
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.100]   so if you step outside around 4 p.m., 5 p.m.,
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.920]   again, what time exactly will depend on time of year
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.440]   and where you are located on our planet,
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.160]   but as the sun starts to head down,
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.000]   you don't necessarily have to see the sunset.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.880]   It'd be lovely if you could.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.300]   Sunsets are beautiful,
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:23.240]   but if you can get outside and see the sun as it arcs down,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.720]   or if you can't see the sun directly,
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.420]   get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon hours,
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:32.160]   so maybe 4 p.m.-ish, and do that for 20, 30 minutes,
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.800]   maybe reading outside or taking a walk.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.900]   I walk the dog again.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.360]   That's my protocol in order to get that evening light.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.260]   What it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.800]   in the late evening hours,
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.960]   which allows you to buffer yourself against
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.740]   the negative effects of bright light later at night.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.440]   Now, it won't allow you to blast your eyes
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.280]   with bright light.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.520]   You still need to dim the lights in the evening,
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.960]   but there's a very nice study that was published
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.180]   in "Scientific Reports" that illustrates
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:06.220]   that if one does this, if you go outside and view sunlight
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:10.320]   in the evening hours for anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes,
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.040]   and I realize that people have a range of constraints
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.760]   on their schedule, but from 5 to 30 minutes,
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.640]   what happens is that your melatonin rhythm
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.980]   stays appropriate.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.640]   Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin,
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.140]   but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.120]   It's actually prevented by light,
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.240]   and melatonin is the hormone that allows you
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.960]   to fall asleep easily.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:36.260]   Now, I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.120]   I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.560]   from your pineal.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.640]   So the protocol is very simple.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.040]   Get outside in the afternoon or evening
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.800]   for 10 to 30 minutes.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.420]   Take your sunglasses off, get some bright light,
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.840]   get some natural light in your eyes.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.760]   If you can't do that, probably better to just stay
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.440]   with standard artificial lights inside.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.800]   Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.740]   Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.640]   People are popping on blue blockers at four o'clock
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.800]   in the afternoon because you're worried
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.520]   that blue light is going to disrupt your sleep.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.140]   Well, you're making your eyes more sensitive
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.500]   to any light that you might see later in the evening,
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.120]   blue light or otherwise.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.940]   So get that afternoon light.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:20.440]   So what you'll probably notice is that the optimal protocols
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.860]   for optimizing your brain and body health and performance
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:27.280]   and sleep, et cetera, are actually really simple.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.520]   But just because they're simple does not mean
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.900]   that they are not powerful.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:32.160]   In fact, they are very powerful
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.380]   because they leverage the most powerful technology
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:37.500]   that exists, which is your nervous system.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.340]   You know, we always think about technologies as devices,
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.640]   and indeed there are some wonderful devices out there.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   Some people are really into tracking their sleep
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.560]   and their sleep time.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.440]   If you're into that, great.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.220]   That's not something that I personally do,
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:51.560]   although I keep telling myself that I should do that.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.480]   There are devices that can control brain waves
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:55.320]   and things of that sort.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.920]   But what we are talking about today are really basic things
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.140]   that we can all do that can steer our neurology
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.360]   and our biology in the directions
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.720]   that are going to support workflow,
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.040]   that are going to support hormones,
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.480]   that are going to support brain function.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.640]   So this afternoon light viewing is yet another example
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:16.760]   of leveraging a technology that you were born with
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.760]   and that you will die with
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.380]   and that you will have every day in between
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:24.300]   in order to tweak the hormones of your system,
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.080]   in this case, the hormone melatonin,
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.000]   so that it's released at the appropriate times
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.560]   and not at the wrong times.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.520]   Because we know that when hormones and systems of the body
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.000]   are well aligned with the 24-hour schedule,
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.200]   beautiful things happen.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.800]   And when they are misaligned, terrible things happen.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.640]   Sometimes those terrible things are subtle at first,
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.940]   but disrupting your circadian rhythms is really bad
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.120]   for every system in your body.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.100]   Getting it right, and as you can tell,
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:52.140]   getting it right doesn't take much,
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:55.040]   can really serve to quote unquote optimize you.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:55.960]   When I say optimize,
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:58.160]   I mean, it puts you into a better mood overall,
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.880]   better state for learning, et cetera.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.060]   So get that afternoon light as well.
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.140]   So at some point in the evening,
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.440]   I eat that thing that we call dinner.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.340]   And while it feels sort of strange to talk about my dinner,
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:13.260]   the reason I want to talk about my dinner
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:15.740]   and what I eat for dinner is that for me,
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.140]   dinner, of course, is about eating.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.720]   I'll mention again, I love eating,
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:24.540]   but also about optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.100]   So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.380]   I'm not one of these people that will eat anything
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:34.380]   or avoid eating anything simply to benefit from that.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.620]   I do enjoy food very, very much.
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:40.140]   And so my dinner generally is comprised of things
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.180]   that are going to support rest and deep sleep.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:46.220]   And that means starchy carbohydrates.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.140]   It's absolutely clear that one of the major ways
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.980]   that we can increase serotonin,
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   which helps in the transition to sleep,
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:56.140]   is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.060]   Now I realize that starchy carbohydrates
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:00.300]   are kind of a demonized term nowadays,
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.460]   and everyone's anti-carbs,
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:05.860]   but we really should distinguish between refined sugars
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:07.220]   and complex carbohydrates.
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:08.580]   And we did an episode about this.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:10.100]   We talked about how refined sugars
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.660]   disrupt not just metabolism,
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:15.620]   but they actually disrupt some of the neurons in the gut
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.820]   that sense fatty acids and amino acids
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.220]   from fats and proteins.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:22.260]   But those same neurons can actually respond to sugar
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.580]   and create a situation where
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.100]   you actually start craving more sugar
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.500]   because those neurons in your gut
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.860]   communicate via a nerve pathway for your aficionados
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.740]   called the vagus nerve,
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:34.760]   and a little cluster of neurons
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.700]   called the nodose ganglia, N-O-D-O-S-E.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:41.540]   Nodose ganglia, so right next to the corner of your jaw,
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.020]   and can trigger the activation
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.520]   and the release of dopamine in your brain,
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.400]   which basically makes you crave more sugar
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.260]   independent of how something tastes.
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:50.420]   So when I say carbohydrates,
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.340]   what I really mean is starchy carbohydrates,
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.760]   non-refined sugars.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.100]   And in the episode about food and mood,
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.700]   and metabolism as well,
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.980]   I referenced a really spectacular lecture
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.240]   by Dr. Robert Lustig,
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.540]   who's a pediatric endocrinologist at UCSF,
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:09.960]   UC San Francisco, absolutely spectacular talk.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.640]   You can find it on YouTube easily,
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.900]   where he talks about the science of refined sugars.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:18.080]   And this isn't in any kind of conspiracy or paranoid way.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.160]   This is really the medical and scientific literature.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.620]   So my dinner is carbohydrates and some protein.
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.540]   So maybe some chicken or fish or something like that.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.900]   Maybe some eggs or sometimes just pasta
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:30.800]   or just rice and vegetables.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.220]   And that's because I enjoy those foods,
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:37.480]   but also because I want to increase the amount of serotonin
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.920]   in my brain so that I can actually fall asleep that night.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.980]   Many people who are on low carbohydrate diets
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.380]   struggle with falling and staying asleep.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.380]   And that's because it's hard to achieve
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.360]   heightened levels of serotonin,
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.120]   which are necessary to enter sleep.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.720]   I should also mention that melatonin and serotonin
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.280]   fall in the same pathway.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.760]   They are related hormones and neuromodulators.
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.960]   We won't go into their biosynthesis now,
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.720]   but essentially what we're talking about
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.200]   is a system that's biasing us towards rest and relaxation
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.220]   as opposed to wakefulness.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.400]   You might ask, well, can't I just take serotonin?
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.240]   Can't I just take 5-HTP or a precursor to serotonin
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.080]   or tryptophan?
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.640]   And indeed you can.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.480]   However, many people, including myself,
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.360]   find that when they supplement with serotonin
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.680]   in the evening or at night,
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:24.160]   that can cause problems in the architecture
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.240]   or the structure of sleep.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.360]   It can cause a lot of people,
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.640]   including me, to fall asleep very fast,
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.340]   sleep very deeply for three or four hours,
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:33.680]   and then wake up and have a terrible time
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.800]   falling back asleep.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.540]   And that effect, at least for me, can last several days.
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.620]   It's really disruptive.
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.840]   So I don't like to supplement with anything
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.560]   that is directly dopamine or a precursor to dopamine
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.060]   at any time or directly serotonin
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:49.440]   or a precursor to serotonin.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440]   Rather, there are other things
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.020]   that can enhance the transition to sleep safely,
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.680]   which we will talk about in a few minutes.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.560]   But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.560]   for that specific purpose of generating a sense of calm.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.380]   And of course, carbohydrates are delicious.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:07.000]   And because I'm doing some physical training,
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.440]   and presumably you are as well,
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.000]   I hope you are 'cause it's so beneficial to one's health,
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.760]   that's also going to replenish my glycogen stores,
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.060]   which is one of the primary fuel sources
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.120]   for moving one's muscles and moving around
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.220]   and doing exercise, as well as for the brain
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.600]   and for cognitive function.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.320]   So low carbohydrates throughout the 24-hour period
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.400]   are not something that are attractive to me.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.760]   I realize that some people will do much better
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.920]   on a low carbohydrate or even ketogenic diet,
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.440]   but for me, and I do believe for most people,
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:40.120]   creating a situation of maybe fasting
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.520]   and then low carb or no carb diets
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:45.160]   for states of alertness and focus
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.640]   at one portion of the day,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.600]   and then ingesting starch carbohydrates
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.420]   for sake of inducing rest and relaxation
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:57.320]   is a at least scientifically rationally based protocol.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.000]   It's grounded in real neurochemistry.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.160]   It's grounded in things that we can point to and say,
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.120]   ah, this food substance, this thing can support my brain,
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.320]   not directly because it's some magic substance
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.740]   that's going to make all my neurons extremely robust,
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:16.080]   but rather it's going to support sleep,
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.440]   which is perhaps the foundation
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.840]   of all mental and physical health.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.480]   In fact, we can point to sleep as the primary way
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.400]   in which we can ensure our overall health,
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.080]   including our brain health.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.340]   So let's talk about sleep and how to access sleep,
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.800]   how to fall asleep easily,
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.560]   and how to make sure that the sleep we have
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.740]   is of sufficient duration and quality.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.900]   One way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature
[01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.000]   that's necessary to fall and stay asleep.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.760]   So as I mentioned earlier, in the early parts of the day
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.960]   after waking, our body temperature is rising,
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.160]   and that continues throughout the day.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.900]   And then sometime late in the afternoon,
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:56.720]   our temperature peaks, and then it starts to drop.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.100]   That drop in temperature of one to three degrees
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:01.520]   is vitally important for us
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.320]   to be able to fall asleep easily.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.680]   One way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:10.560]   is to accelerate that drop in temperature.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.520]   And one way to accelerate that drop in temperature
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.800]   somewhat counter-intuitively is to use hot baths,
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.160]   hot showers, or if you have access to one, a sauna.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.000]   Now, this is counter-intuitive because you'd say,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.360]   well, hot baths, so it's going to heat me up.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.040]   But actually, if you are to get into a sauna
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.700]   or a hot shower or a hot bath and then get out,
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.680]   your body is going to engage particular mechanisms
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.080]   for cooling itself off that are going to allow you
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.760]   to drop your temperature more quickly
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.640]   and fall asleep more easily.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.720]   And this is why many people find that falling asleep
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.080]   after a nice hot shower, bath, or sauna
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.080]   is really, really easy and really terrific.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.640]   It's sort of a natural state
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.700]   that follows hot baths, saunas, and showers.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.740]   So how would you do this?
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:58.020]   Well, we did an entire episode on this topic as well,
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:00.160]   the use of sauna for sake of growth hormone release.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.100]   If you want to check that out and all the details,
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:05.940]   you can look at the episode on growth hormone.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.080]   You will experience a growth hormone release
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.240]   from sauna, hot bath, and hot shower,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.560]   provided they are done for sufficient duration
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.840]   and sufficiently high temperature.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.240]   For all the details of that, please go to that episode.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:18.140]   It's all laid out there.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:19.040]   It's all timestamped.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.840]   It's all captioned in English and Spanish, et cetera.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.320]   But basically what we're talking about
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:25.360]   is 20 minutes in the sauna,
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.120]   or if you're one of those folks
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.040]   who's really chasing growth hormone release,
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.280]   you could do 20 minutes,
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.960]   then get out of the sauna for 10 minutes
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.680]   and just cool off at room temperature
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.000]   and then get back into the sauna,
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.360]   then get out and then shower or dry off and head to bed.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.660]   Shorter bouts of sauna will work also.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:46.180]   The longer bouts of sauna cooling, sauna cooling
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:48.760]   have been shown to lead to huge increases in growth hormone,
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.760]   and growth hormone, of course,
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.720]   is involved both in muscle growth,
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.020]   but also growth and metabolism of all tissues,
[01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:57.640]   fat metabolism, and repair of various tissues.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.880]   So it's not just about growth.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.800]   You hear growth hormone, you think hypertrophy,
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.440]   but the enhancement of metabolism and health and repair
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.040]   in a number of tissues.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.640]   So that's one way you can leverage heat
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.640]   toward the transition to sleep
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.800]   by the ways in which exposure to heat
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.040]   actually cools off your body.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.000]   Now let's talk about actually getting to sleep,
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.840]   and let's talk about behavioral protocols first.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.880]   It is absolutely true
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.640]   that keeping the room very dark is beneficial.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.040]   Some people, including myself, have thin eyelids,
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.640]   and it doesn't take much light
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.800]   to wake up the brain and body.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.240]   So keeping a room very dark is essential.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.240]   The other thing is keeping the room cool.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.440]   You've probably heard this before.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.680]   Keep the room cool, get under warm blankets.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.920]   But rarely is it discussed
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:41.720]   why keeping the room cool is useful.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.520]   The reason keeping the room cool is useful
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.680]   for getting into and staying asleep
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.920]   is that throughout the night,
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:51.200]   there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed,
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.800]   so-called REM sleep, that's a healthy paralysis,
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.960]   presumably so you can't act out your dreams,
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.840]   but there are portions of the night where you can move.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.200]   And one of the more important movements
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.000]   that you do in the middle of the night
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.080]   is put your hand out or your foot out,
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.680]   or you take your face out from under the covers
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.560]   as a means to cool yourself,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.440]   and you do this while you are asleep.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.040]   If you are in a cool room,
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.840]   you can put yourself under the blankets to stay warm,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.840]   and then if you want to cool off,
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.640]   you can simply remove a limb
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.640]   or you can toss the covers off entirely.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.820]   However, if you are in a room that's too warm,
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.000]   it's very hard to cool off.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.800]   You would need a bucket of ice water
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.160]   or to get up and turn on the air conditioning
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.280]   or something of that sort, or turn on the fan.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:37.040]   So it's a simple but non-trivial way
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.400]   in which we can improve our entrance to sleep
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.760]   and staying asleep.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.920]   So keep the room cool or cold and get under warm blankets.
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:48.120]   And if you want to understand more
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.800]   about why putting a hand out or a foot out
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.520]   is valuable for cooling,
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:55.920]   I did an episode on the role of cooling
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.620]   in something called heat dumping or bringing heat
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.960]   into the body through the palms, the face,
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:03.800]   and the bottoms of the feet.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.240]   You've got these portals, these radiators, if you will,
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.400]   that allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:12.660]   I don't want to go into the details now,
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:14.120]   but that episode is entitled
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.480]   Supercharge Your Exercise with Cold.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.840]   This is based on work that was done by Craig Heller's lab
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.540]   at Stanford University.
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:22.560]   Absolutely incredible data
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.360]   showing that the proper use of palmer cooling,
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.040]   so the palms or the upper half of the face
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.000]   or the bottoms of the feet can vastly,
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.480]   I mean, vastly increase the volume of exercise
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.520]   that one can do and still recover from that exercise
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.120]   and derive benefits from it.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.440]   But this method of cooling for exercise
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.160]   is grounded in a basic physiological function
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.640]   of our palms, the bottoms of our feet and our face,
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.860]   which is to dump heat or to allow cool
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:50.200]   to pass into the body.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.200]   So that's why in the middle of the night,
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.440]   as long as you're not in REM sleep,
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.160]   if you get too warm, you put your foot out
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.520]   or you put your arms out,
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.340]   you're actually allowing cooling of the body
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.920]   through what are called AVAs,
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.360]   arteriovenous astymoses is the technical name,
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.640]   that are in the palms, the upper half of the face
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.760]   and the bottoms of the feet.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.080]   And that's a very efficient way to cool off your body,
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.960]   so you do that subconsciously.
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.840]   Now, there are things that one can take
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.320]   to enhance the transition to sleep.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.520]   I am not a fan of melatonin
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.300]   for enhancing the transition to sleep
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:26.140]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.440]   One, dosages of melatonin are far too high
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.160]   in most supplements.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.140]   Melatonin can have some negative effects
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.960]   on the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.140]   That's a serious concern.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:40.120]   Third, melatonin's role during puberty or around puberty
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.100]   is to suppress the onset of puberty.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:44.200]   So that's concerning.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.840]   I don't know that people should be taking this hormone
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.160]   that has all these other effects.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.920]   The other reason is that melatonin
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.260]   will aid the transition to sleep,
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:52.280]   but it won't keep you asleep.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.560]   And many people that take melatonin
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.400]   find that they fall asleep more quickly,
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.600]   but then they wake up unable to fall back asleep.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.640]   Three compounds that could be very beneficial
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.540]   for aiding the transition to sleep
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:05.520]   and for which there are wide safety margins,
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.100]   although please do check with your physician
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:11.080]   before taking anything, are specific forms of magnesium,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.120]   something called apigenin and theanine.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.740]   Magnesium comes in many forms.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.480]   Magnesium malate has been shown to improve
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.320]   recovery from sore muscles.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.200]   For instance, magnesium citrate
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.900]   is an excellent laxative, for instance.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.440]   Magnesium threonate, that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:32.600]   threonate and magnesium biglycinate
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.720]   have transporters that allow them
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.760]   to cross the blood-brain barrier more readily
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.280]   than other forms of magnesium.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.080]   And there within the brain,
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.920]   they promote the release of a neurotransmitter called GABA,
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.660]   which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:47.560]   which shuts off the forebrain to some extent.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.600]   It doesn't shut off completely,
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.200]   but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination,
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.820]   planning, and what we call executive function.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:58.020]   So for many people taking 300 to 400 milligrams
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:01.000]   of magnesium biglycinate or magnesium threonate,
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.520]   and there I'm referring to the elemental magnesium
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.280]   for you aficionados, many people find
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.860]   that doing that 30 to 60 minutes before sleep
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.200]   can aid them in falling asleep,
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:14.080]   can really help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.680]   Some people, however, achieve some gastrointestinal
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:21.600]   discomfort from magnesium and therefore should avoid it.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:24.240]   Magnesium threonate and magnesium biglycinate
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:27.160]   for many people work, however,
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.400]   and when coupled with apigenin and theanine,
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.840]   provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.380]   that seems to be very effective
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:38.680]   in aiding the transition to sleep.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.640]   So apigenin is the substance that's found in chamomile,
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.440]   and 50 milligrams of apigenin taken 30 minutes before sleep
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:50.120]   can act as another way to shut off the forebrain
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.300]   and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety,
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:55.340]   and allow people to fall and stay asleep.
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.280]   I did a podcast with Dr. Daria Rose.
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.040]   She's got an excellent podcast
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.380]   that I highly recommend you check out,
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.560]   covers a number of different health,
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.880]   scientific, and other subjects,
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.540]   and she's a PhD in neuroscience,
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.320]   terrific scientist, et cetera.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.200]   She's a big fan of apigenin, as am I.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.960]   And then the third compound is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.920]   Theanine is a compound that can also increase GABA,
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.200]   but also increases activation
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.940]   of something called chloride channels.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.320]   Chloride channels are another way
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:30.440]   in which neurons turn themselves off or turn each other off,
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.980]   not turn each other off in the way
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:33.560]   that we're typically heard, like that turns me off,
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.800]   but turn them off and then shut them down,
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.860]   lower their levels of activity.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.840]   So magnesium threonate or by glycinate,
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.440]   apigenin and theanine in combination can be very effective
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.060]   for aiding the transition to sleep.
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:47.720]   And I realized that not everyone wants to take supplements.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.600]   I certainly am not pushing any of these.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:52.640]   I would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.220]   and stay asleep for the duration of time that they want
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.060]   without any supplemental help.
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:59.400]   But I do think it's important to point out some things
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:01.300]   that lie somewhere between doing nothing
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.840]   and taking prescription drugs,
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.180]   because many of the prescription drugs
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:08.480]   associated with sleep, and you all know what those are,
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:10.340]   carry other side effects.
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:15.120]   They can create bad dreams, often very disturbing dreams.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.660]   They can be addictive or at least habit forming.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.640]   They can create grogginess in the morning.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.780]   Some are safer than others.
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.480]   There's a variety of them out there,
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:25.480]   but for those that want to explore supplements
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.640]   and how they can impact sleep,
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.160]   this combination of about 300, 400 milligrams
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:31.840]   of magnesium threonate or by glycinate,
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.480]   50 milligrams of apigenin,
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.280]   and 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine alone
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:39.660]   or in combination have been beneficial to many people.
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:42.560]   And there are excellent studies to support those statements.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.920]   Again, I suggest you go to examine.com
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.960]   and look up the human effect matrix
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.440]   for each of those compounds and you can explore them.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.860]   One of the more interesting aspects to magnesium threonate
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.080]   and by glycinate is that it seems to have
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.040]   some neuroprotective effects as well.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.200]   There aren't many studies on it,
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.280]   but the few studies that are there point to the fact
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.660]   that magnesium threonate and magnesium by glycinate
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:05.800]   can also support neuron health and neuron longevity,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.960]   which is just an added bonus in my opinion.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.280]   Now, what if you wake up in the middle of the night?
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.480]   This is a very common occurrence
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.840]   and there are two general themes
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.720]   around waking up in the middle of the night
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.380]   that one can use tools to counteract.
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.440]   The first theme is if you're somebody
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.600]   who is tired in the evenings
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.340]   and you're kind of pushing yourself to stay awake,
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.940]   so you're going to the party
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:31.460]   or you're pushing yourself to study your work
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.880]   when in fact you'd like to get into bed at 8, 30, or 9,
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.160]   and then you're falling asleep around 10, 30, 11
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.040]   and waking up at 2, 30, or 3 in the morning
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.860]   and you can't fall back asleep,
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:42.640]   chances are that your melatonin pulse
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:45.080]   was initiated early in the night.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.080]   So that melatonin pulse started probably around 8, 30, or 9,
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.080]   but you're staying up, you're battling that melatonin.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.160]   And then sometime around 2, 30, or 3 in the morning,
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.240]   that melatonin is no longer present,
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.120]   it's sufficiently high levels in your bloodstream
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.200]   and you're waking up,
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.920]   you're getting your morning cortisol pulse
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:07.300]   shifted into those wee hours of the morning.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.920]   You may not like this advice,
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.560]   but one of the things that you can do to offset that
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.860]   is to simply go to bed earlier.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.240]   By going to bed earlier,
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.440]   you're going to get the longer duration of sleep.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.120]   But I realize that there are social reasons
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.160]   and work-related reasons why going to bed at 8, 30, or 9
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:25.600]   is not necessarily beneficial to your life.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:29.500]   So in that case, you might be one of the rare individuals
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.680]   for whom getting a little bit more bright light
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.600]   in the evening could be a good thing.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:36.960]   So this would be around the hours of 7 or 8 p.m.,
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.780]   and in that way, causing that pulse in melatonin
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:45.780]   to be delayed because again, light inhibits melatonin.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:47.240]   Now, the other thing is,
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:49.060]   many people wake up in the middle of the night
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:52.500]   because of anxiety or because they have to use the restroom.
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.200]   It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights,
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.380]   but keep the lights dim.
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:57.760]   But if you flip on those lights,
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.200]   try and flip them off as soon as possible
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:01.960]   and try and get back into bed.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.960]   And if you have trouble falling asleep again
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.440]   and you absolutely need to sleep,
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.060]   that's where these NSDR,
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.720]   these non-sleep deep rest protocols
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.080]   can really be beneficial.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:13.300]   Even though the NS, the non-sleep part,
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.940]   might make you think that they will prevent you
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:19.960]   from falling asleep, rather than trying to fight your mind,
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:21.800]   trying to fight anxiety,
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.360]   which is always a terrible thing to do.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.000]   I always say it's very hard to control the mind
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:25.820]   with the mind.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.480]   Look to the body, and that's what NSDR scripts do.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.380]   Things like yoga nidra, even the sleep hypnosis
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:33.420]   done in the middle of the night,
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.160]   if you wake up and want to fall back asleep,
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.160]   oftentimes will help you fall back asleep immediately.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.200]   And if they don't,
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.000]   they will at least put your brain and body
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.920]   into a state of deep relaxation
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.180]   that more closely mimics the sleep state
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:48.920]   that you ought to be in than the awake ruminating,
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:51.480]   stressing about the fact that you're not sleeping state.
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.240]   So if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:55.000]   really try and get back to sleep.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.920]   And if you can't do that by doing, for instance,
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:00.320]   long exhale breathing, which can work,
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.020]   use some other tool of the body to shift the mind.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:05.720]   And the tools that I'm recommending
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.440]   are of the non-sleep deep rest variety.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.480]   So now we've essentially traveled around the clock,
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:14.400]   so to speak, from the time where one wakes up
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.980]   until the time they start working,
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:20.400]   until the time they exercise, eat lunch,
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.760]   do an NSDR, head to sleep, get to sleep,
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:27.120]   maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et cetera.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:30.400]   I want to emphasize that although people's schedules vary,
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.520]   most people are doing more than one or two workouts per day.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.600]   And indeed, I'm doing more than one
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.160]   or two workouts per day.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:41.120]   I really emphasize that morning 90-minute work block
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.140]   because I think most people would agree
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:46.440]   that there's a portion of each day
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.620]   in which we need to do the hardest thing
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.380]   or the most important thing,
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:54.780]   or the thing that demands the most of our cognitive self.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.360]   I position that early in the day,
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.640]   and I position everything around that
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.680]   in order to ensure that it happens
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:03.600]   and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.960]   And yes, I make sure that it happens every day.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:08.820]   And that brings about two other important points.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:12.380]   First of all, we do have this thing called weekends,
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:16.060]   and I tend to take one day off per week, not both,
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:19.960]   much to the dismay of people in my life and Costello.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:24.000]   But nonetheless, there is something called weekend drift,
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.520]   which is that we can be very regimented
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.000]   on a Monday or a Tuesday,
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.120]   and then even if we're good about maintaining a schedule,
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.980]   Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, et cetera,
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:35.420]   most of us, I would hope,
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:37.800]   would alter their schedule somewhat on the weekends
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:40.880]   in order to recover and get some additional rest.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:43.480]   And I want to emphasize, I absolutely do that.
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.520]   I take one day per week where I go full Costello,
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.120]   where I essentially do nothing in a structured way.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.160]   At least if I have my way, I'm not making any plans.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:55.200]   I'm completely free to explore what I want to do
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.500]   and when I want to do it.
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:57.800]   That's not the way life works out.
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:00.440]   Oftentimes there are social engagements and other things
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.680]   that get in the way or that I enjoy,
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:04.360]   and that breaks up the day.
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.260]   But I do take rest.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:08.880]   I don't think that one has to follow the same schedule
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:09.840]   every single day.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.600]   However, I do think there are a few things
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.240]   that people should do every single day if possible.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:18.280]   And those are get morning sunlight,
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:20.120]   because if you don't, your circadian rhythms
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:21.520]   and your health, et cetera, and your mood
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:23.440]   are going to start to drift
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:26.840]   and to try and get sleep on a regular basis.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.480]   And of course, some of the greatest of things in life
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.320]   happen after 10 p.m.,
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.940]   and some of those even involve sleepless nights
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.000]   of various kinds.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.720]   I certainly don't want to discourage people
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.560]   from having a social life or from having a robust party life
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.720]   if that's your thing, or for enjoying life,
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.360]   because that's certainly one of the main things
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.760]   that we should all be pursuing is to enjoy life.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.840]   The only point I want to make about sleep
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.360]   is that if you happen to stay up late,
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:59.180]   it's still best to get up at your regular wake-up time.
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:01.280]   It's a very simple solution to a problem
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:02.520]   that a lot of people have,
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.320]   which is they stay up till two or three in the morning,
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.720]   and then they tend to sleep late,
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:07.780]   and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:11.040]   Try on most days and most nights
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.120]   to wake up at more or less the same time
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.920]   and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time.
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.860]   In fact, I was talking to Matt Walker about this recently,
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:21.300]   and he was also surprised to see these new data,
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:22.840]   and I was surprised to see these new data
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.860]   that emphasized that if you get a poor night's sleep,
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:29.080]   or if you're up late the previous night for good reasons,
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.960]   many people feel like they just want to go to bed
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.020]   early the next night,
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.480]   but it turns out that's not the best thing to do
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.540]   for your immediate and long-term health.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.860]   Try and stay up to the point
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.380]   where you would normally stay up and then get to sleep.
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:41.940]   If you go to bed a couple hours earlier,
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:43.380]   it's probably not going to kill you,
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:46.900]   but try to not go to bed, for instance, at 6 p.m.
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:48.560]   because you were up the entire night before.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.840]   That can really be disruptive.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.660]   The other thing I want to emphasize is that
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:57.440]   even though that morning 90-minute work block is so vital,
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.440]   of course, there's a second work block,
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:01.380]   and in fact, I described one in the afternoon
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:02.620]   after the NSDR.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.820]   For me, that's reverie hypnosis.
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:08.780]   There's a 90-minute work block in which I drop in again
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.740]   in a no internet connection, no phone kind of way
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.660]   to complete some work that's important to me.
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:18.180]   So combined, that's just three hours of focused work,
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.180]   which may not seem like a lot,
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:22.140]   but if you were to dissect your day
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.760]   and kind of look at the arc and structure of your day,
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:28.660]   I'd be willing to bet that if we added up
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:31.400]   the total period of time in which you were in
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:33.760]   what Cal Newport would call deep work,
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.580]   really focused, dedicated work,
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:39.040]   that it would probably amount to about three or four hours.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:42.060]   If you can squeeze in another 90-minute work block,
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:44.720]   or if you can get four 90-minute work blocks,
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.820]   well, then more power to you,
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:48.300]   but I think most people find that one or two
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:51.360]   of these really deep focused 90-minute work blocks
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.380]   are about what one's schedule and even mind can handle.
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:56.940]   And of course, throughout the day,
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.440]   there are other things happening
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.820]   outside of those 90-minute work blocks.
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.360]   I'm checking my text messages, I'm checking my email,
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.060]   I'm responding to various demands,
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.000]   I'm working and tending to life.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.060]   So while I've carved some boundaries
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:13.580]   or delineated some boundaries around those work blocks,
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.500]   and I'm certain that if you do too,
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:16.800]   you will benefit from them,
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.640]   they are certainly not the only periods of time each day
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.640]   in which I or I believe other people
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.220]   should be trying to learn or trying to focus.
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:26.380]   And I want to emphasize that even though my job
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.620]   is to discover knowledge and distribute knowledge
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:30.680]   because I'm a scientist,
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.980]   I realized that 90-minute work blocks
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:35.280]   of the sort that I'm describing
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:37.920]   may not apply specifically to the kinds of work you do
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.780]   if you're an artist or a sculptor or you build furniture
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.220]   or whatever it is that you happen to do,
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.140]   you teach children or they teach you,
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:45.900]   whatever it happens to be.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:50.340]   Of course, please adapt and modify what I've described today
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.780]   in ways that best serve you and your schedule.
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:55.580]   What I've tried to do is provide you a picture
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:58.660]   of the 24-hour schedule that I follow
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:01.720]   and why I do certain things at particular times
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:03.660]   and why I do those particular things.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.500]   And I've really tried to emphasize the scientific rationale
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:09.300]   behind those things, the peer-reviewed data.
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.420]   In some cases, I pointed out the specific papers.
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:14.240]   In other cases, I've referred to large bodies of work
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:16.060]   that support these practices.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.940]   When I say large bodies of work,
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.060]   I'm a big fan of looking to the scientific literature
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:23.920]   and asking where is the center of mass
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.720]   for a particular topic?
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.720]   For instance, where is there 50 or 100 or 1,000 papers
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.180]   that, for instance, support morning light viewing
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:38.900]   in order to optimize melatonin secretion later in the day,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.960]   cortisol secretion early in the day,
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:43.140]   mood, metabolism, et cetera.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:47.640]   If one were to put into PubMed light, metabolism, and mood,
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.540]   you would literally get tens of thousands,
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.360]   maybe even hundreds of thousands of studies.
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.720]   So when I say the center of mass,
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:56.960]   what I've really tried to do is examine the literature
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:00.940]   and figure out where there's a sort of a directive protocol
[02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:04.180]   that emerges from all these various studies that used,
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:06.800]   in some cases, animals, in many cases, humans,
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:09.840]   and explore different what we call dependent variables.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.920]   Some studies were looking at effects on blood sugar,
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:13.340]   other on mood.
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:16.540]   So I hope that makes clear why the rationale
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:18.280]   behind what I provided today.

[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.820]   During today's episode, I describe various supplements
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:06.980]   that one might want to consider taking.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:10.780]   We've partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com,
[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:12.760]   because Thorne supplements are known to be
[02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:15.720]   of the very highest stringency and quality.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.160]   When I say stringency and quality,
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:20.080]   that means the quality of the individual ingredients,
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.340]   as well as the amounts of those ingredients match precisely
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:25.280]   with what's listed on the packaging.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.860]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I personally take,
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:32.600]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:34.820]   and there you'll see all the supplements that I take,
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:37.720]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:40.660]   or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
