[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   Today we talk with David Platt,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.520]   who turns 40 years old in just a couple of weeks.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.160]   And no one knows how to pack life into a few short years,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.440]   like David Platt packs ministry into a few years.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   I just went back and looked at the last 12 years
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.480]   of his ministry, it's remarkable.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.060]   In 2006, at the age of 26,
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.280]   he became the lead pastor of the church at Brook Hills,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   named the youngest megachurch pastor
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.640]   in America at the time.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.680]   There he launched Secret Church,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880]   which is an intensive Bible study
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.080]   that has become popular around the globe.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.280]   In 2010, he published the New York Times bestseller,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.520]   "Radical, Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream."
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   He launched the online resource site radical.net
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.360]   about 10 years ago.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.160]   And in 2013, he helped launch the first Cross Conference,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.880]   a very strategic missions conference.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.440]   In 2014, after some significant experiences
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.680]   on the mission field,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.220]   and seeing the desperation of the globally lost,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.760]   he returned to the States
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.000]   and felt led to leave pastoral ministry
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.640]   to become the president
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.960]   of the Southern Baptist Convention's
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480]   International Mission Board,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.400]   a massive missionary ascending organization.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.600]   He moved to Virginia,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.880]   and from what I hear, he brought significant change,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.280]   not least of which was much needed financial reforms.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.140]   Then in February of 2017, he returned to preaching,
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520]   this time at McLean Bible Church, a DC area megachurch,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960]   officially becoming the church's teaching pastor
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.680]   in September of last year.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.080]   Initially, he aimed to do both,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.360]   to preach and to lead the IMB,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880]   but early this year in February,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.480]   he said it wasn't gonna work,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.240]   and he intended to resign from the IMB
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.760]   once the SBC could find his replacement.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.480]   We recently reached out to David
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.760]   to hear his heart for local churches
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.800]   and how he views the local church as home base
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.660]   in the advance of global missions.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.960]   It's a pattern he sees in the mission of Paul.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.940]   - He's with those elders from the church at Ephesus,
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.340]   a love for the local church,
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060]   a desire to preach the whole counsel of God
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.180]   in the local church,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.740]   and that's coupled with a zeal,
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.340]   an ambition to see Christ preach
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.300]   where he's not been named.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.700]   And so I just came to the conclusion,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.660]   okay, if I'm gonna preach as pastor in a local church
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.380]   and build up a local church in that way,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860]   then I need to find a different way
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.140]   to serve for the cause of global missions.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.420]   So that's when I asked the trustees of the IMB
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.380]   to begin searching for a new president.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.580]   I'm still serving in both these roles now.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.260]   Lord willing, we'll do so until a new president is found,
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260]   at which time I wanna be supportive of that leader, the IMB,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.820]   and then I'll continue serving as teaching pastor
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.980]   at McLean in DC,
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.140]   just shepherding that church to glorify God
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.100]   by making disciples and multiplying churches
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.940]   among the nations.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.380]   Okay, so I wanna do that faithfully in this local church
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.060]   and alongside the other elders and pastors there.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.300]   And then I'm just exhilarated as I think about
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.420]   how through writing, preaching,
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.020]   leading radical the ministry,
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.380]   which is intended to serve other churches on mission
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.980]   and other avenues the Lord might open up.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.900]   I wanna leverage my life as a pastor
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.180]   for the spread of God's glory among the nations.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.620]   I actually have a conviction.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.260]   I've said this throughout my time in the IMB
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.780]   that pastors of local churches
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.420]   possess responsibility for global missions.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.900]   And George Pentecost said 100 years ago
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   to the pastor belongs the privilege
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.220]   and responsibility of the missionary problem.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.860]   And basically what he was saying is
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.980]   mission organizations can and should do what they will
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.140]   to organize, but facilitate mission in different ways.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.940]   But it's the responsibility and the privilege
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.940]   of every pastor to fan a flame for God's global glory
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.540]   in the local church.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.620]   And I just think when pastors are shepherding
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.900]   local churches for God's global glory,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660]   it changes everything.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.140]   And I was in Psalm 96 this morning.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.780]   This is not just for missionaries.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.620]   Like declare His glory among the nations
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.100]   as marvelous deeds among all the peoples
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.420]   and praying for the Eritrean Tigray people,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.220]   like over a million of them,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.860]   0.05% know and believe the gospel.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.700]   Most have never heard.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   Like we as pastors must shepherd churches to change that.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.300]   So I wanna do that personally
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.660]   and then encourage churches to be a part
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.220]   of changing that reality.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.660]   - Yeah, that's so good.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.860]   So you turn 40 years old in a couple of weeks.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.580]   Congratulations on that.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.540]   Offer us some midlife reflections
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.100]   on being roughly halfway home, Lord willing.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.300]   As you look back, what would you say
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.940]   are your biggest regrets?
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.260]   And as you look forward, what would you say
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.820]   are your biggest future hopes ahead?
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.700]   - Wow, that's a sobering question.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.900]   You know, when I think about it,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.700]   one, I don't presume, obviously,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.700]   I know you know this, but I'm halfway home.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.580]   Like I've made it this far by God's grace.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.940]   I don't presume upon tomorrow.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.140]   So I wanna make the most of today.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.980]   And that's it.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.700]   I have, especially in light of just some transition
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.060]   ministry-wise that you referenced,
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.020]   I found myself praying just in a fresh way
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.980]   that I praise God.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.460]   When I look back at the last 40 years,
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.940]   like what a picture of grace in my life.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.140]   Like I would not be having this conversation
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.660]   with you right now if the Lord has not been so gracious
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.860]   when he asked about my regrets and my bigotry.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.260]   Regret is just my pride,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   my seemingly relentless focus on myself.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.940]   I'm just the most prideful person I know.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.020]   And I shudder to think where I would be
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.980]   without God saving me from myself
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.300]   time and time and time again.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.540]   So I find myself looking to the future and it's like,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.980]   Lord, please keep saving me from myself.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.860]   So I've prayed though in that,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.500]   that all that by God's grace I've had an opportunity
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.100]   to be a part of in these past years
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.540]   would only be a precursor of what is to come.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.060]   Like when I think about my dreams,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.380]   looking toward the future,
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.580]   sometimes people ask like,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.540]   are you less radical than you were writing about
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.980]   however many years ago?
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.940]   I wanna be more radical.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.580]   It's interesting, a little background behind
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.420]   even the name of that, the title of that book,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.100]   it came from a conversation I was having
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.420]   with Brother Andrew.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.020]   So God smuggler, smuggling Bibles
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.140]   and all of his life going into hard places around the world.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.900]   I was on a phone call with him one day
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.740]   when I was in the process of writing this book
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.420]   and I asked him, so I can't remember how old he was
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.500]   at that point, but pretty advanced in years.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.020]   And I asked him, I said,
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.860]   Brother Andrew, if you had to do it all over again,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.020]   what would you do?
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.220]   And what would you change?
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.660]   And he said, without hesitation,
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.460]   he said, I'd be more radical.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.660]   He said, not radical for the sake of being radical,
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.420]   but radical for the sake of the gospel.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.140]   And I think like that's my art.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.140]   Like I don't wanna be radical
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.060]   for the sake of being radical, whatever that means.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.660]   Like I want to be absolutely committed
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.900]   for the sake of the gospel
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.740]   to making Christ and his glory known in the world.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.740]   So I wanna love God with all my heart, my soul, my mind,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.660]   my strength in the days to come.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.620]   I think I love him more today than I ever have.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.740]   And I just want that to continue to be the case.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.780]   Obviously I wanna love my family well.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.820]   I look at my wife and my kids.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.900]   I wanna, I'm in Deuteronomy right now,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.860]   in my time with the Lord.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.260]   I just wanna pass the word and works of God
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.980]   down to the next generation and their kids.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.780]   I wanna love the church well.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.020]   I am so thankful for the stewardship.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.100]   It's overwhelming that just the stewardship
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.340]   of pastoral ministry.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.380]   I wanna love, lead this church well
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.540]   and leverage my life for the spread of the gospel
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.140]   to the nations and all of that.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.140]   Like I would say a big theme in my prayer time recently
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.620]   has been, it's based on Psalm 90,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.900]   to just to number our days and make in a heart of wisdom.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.860]   Like I have just found myself leading
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.980]   in this next stage of life ministry
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.940]   for wisdom and courage.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.500]   So those two things in particular,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.060]   I don't want one of those without the other.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.980]   I don't wanna be courageous and foolish like that.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.820]   That's not good.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.500]   I also don't wanna be wise and timid.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.340]   I don't wanna be wise and courageous.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.060]   I wanna have a wisdom to discern the will of God
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.780]   and I wanna have courage to walk it.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.460]   I wanna do all that God puts on my heart to do.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.940]   As I look at next stage,
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.020]   I just wanna do all that he puts on my heart to do,
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.020]   just praying in a Psalm 90 17 kind of way
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.020]   for his favor and the establishment of the work of my hands.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.580]   So, and I'm pretty exhilarated about shepherding,
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.780]   on one hand shepherding local church,
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.380]   but love the Lord and make disciples there in DC
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.580]   and from DC to the end of the earth.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.860]   And then looking to leverage opportunities
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.500]   to be a part of, I just see a world of urgent,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.860]   spiritual and physical need,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.940]   unreached and on top of physical need.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.500]   And I wanna see the church with the gospel,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.020]   glorifying Christ and all that
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.380]   and leveraging my life toward that end.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.420]   - Amen, that is just such a constant theme
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.220]   in your life and ministry over these very fruitful years.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.780]   Thank you for that.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.380]   Speaking of looking back,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.180]   what advice does 40 year old David Platt have
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.420]   for 20 year old David Platt?
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.220]   What would you say?
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.700]   - I would say, so I think three words come to mind.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.900]   One is surrender.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:52.300]   Just lay your life before the Lord every day,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   deny yourself, like, Lord, save me from myself,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.100]   save me from my dreams, plans,
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.300]   but I wanna do whatever you want me to do.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.260]   I wanna go wherever you want me to go.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.340]   I just think, I was actually at the Cross Conference
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.140]   one night in our worship
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.540]   and this Matt Boswell, he's leading musical worship.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.380]   And he just paused at one point and he said,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.940]   just think back on God's faithfulness in your life
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.300]   for a minute and just thank him, praise him.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.820]   And I just was overwhelmed with a point of tears
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.140]   because I'm sitting surrounded by all these college students
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.500]   and I'm thinking 20 years ago,
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.860]   I never could have imagined some of the things
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.420]   the Lord has done, how he's led.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.420]   And I just wanna be open to however he wants
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.300]   to lead my life.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.860]   So surrender, second word, abide.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.860]   Like, I think the key in it all is abiding in him,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.580]   in his word, in prayer.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.580]   Like, I've not regretted in the last 20, 40 years
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.860]   for that matter, anytime spending the word,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.780]   anytime spending prayer, fasting, just seeking the Lord
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.980]   and walking in obedience to his commands.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.300]   I just, I don't know what all the coming years
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.140]   that the Lord gives them to me hold,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.660]   but I'm trusting that if I'm surrendered to him,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.260]   totally just my life before him and abiding in him,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.100]   then the third word that comes to my mind is rest.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.700]   Like, I can rest that he will lead, he will guide,
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.940]   he will direct my life for his purposes.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.940]   And in the end, I wanna finish faithful.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.140]   I think 1 Corinthians 4, one and two,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.220]   what is required of us as servants of Christ
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.180]   and stewards of the mysteries of God
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.340]   that we be found faithful.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.660]   That is my prayer.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.620]   So my encouragement would be to my 20 something self
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.380]   or other 20 something, or anybody for that matter,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.260]   like surrender to the Lord, abide in him and rest,
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.340]   just trust him as he leads and guides and directs
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.340]   and Lord willing, our lives will be spent for his purposes.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.300]   - Amen, so good.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.700]   Thank you for taking time to talk with us today, brother.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.100]   I really appreciate it.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.060]   - Well, I just know I am incredibly thankful.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.420]   You're not asking me to say this at all,
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.820]   but I would just say, I look back at my life
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.020]   and there's no question that the ministry of Pastor John,
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.460]   desiring God has had a huge and formative effect
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.420]   on my own mind, my own heart, my own relationship with the
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.060]   Lord in ways that I am indebted to God for his grace
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.100]   and then through you all.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.900]   So yeah, just thank you for the impact you've had on me
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.980]   and countless others like me.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.260]   - Thank you for the accommodation and the encouragement.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.100]   I appreciate it.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.940]   Thanks, David.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.780]   - Thanks Tony, see ya.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.820]   - All right, goodbye.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.980]   That was David Platt from his office.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.140]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.820]   The Ask Pastor John podcast will return on Monday
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.660]   with Pastor John.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.620]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.780]   (upbeat music)
