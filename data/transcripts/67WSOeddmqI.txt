[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Go back in your Bibles to Romans, chapter 5, and I remind you of what we read earlier
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:20.680]   in this service, Romans 5:8, that God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.640]   yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.840]   It was definitely a cross of love.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.280]   There are so many facets of the cross.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   There are so many angles, so many perspectives regarding the death of Christ.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.320]   But one that is powerful, if it's understood, is laid out for us in the portion of Scripture
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.000]   I read to you earlier.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   And it is the comparison between
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.560]   -
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.740]   "Adam and his impact, and Christ and His impact."
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.060]   The reason this comparison even comes up in the book of Romans is because a question arises
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.620]   as Paul presents the gospel, and the question is this: when he speaks about the death of
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.480]   Christ being all that is necessary for our salvation, having been validated by His resurrection,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:37.920]   the question that immediately follows that is, "How could an act by one man have such
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.820]   a massive effect on so many people throughout all of human history?"
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.360]   That's the question.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.400]   The Christian gospel says Christ died for the sins of the world.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:07.360]   How could any act that any one person did effect so many?
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   And Paul answers that by bringing up the impact of Adam.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:26.320]   If you look back at chapter 5 and verse 12, you read, "Through one man sin was made."
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.500]   "Through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.560]   all men, because all sinned."
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.820]   What Paul is saying there is that we were represented by Adam, and because he sinned,
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:56.240]   that one sin, the entire human race was impacted.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   It impacted forever the entire human race.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.960]   And that is Paul's example of the fact that the act of one person can have a massive effect
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   on many others.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:26.160]   Adam's one sin caused all in the human race to be born into corruption and death and judgment.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:41.720]   And as one act by one man cursed all of humanity, so one act by the Lord Jesus Christ causes
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.820]   all who are in Him to be raised to righteousness and eternal life.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.080]   All who were in Adam when Adam's sin died, all who were in Christ when Adam's sin died,
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.620]   Christ died, are impacted by the one act of each man.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.040]   Go down to verse 15, and let me take you through this in a way that I hope will encourage you.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.380]   You will notice several times in this passage the phrase "much more."
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.740]   It's in verse 9, "much more."
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.040]   It's in verse 10, "much more."
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.520]   It's in verse 15, "much more."
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's in verse 17, "much more."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.940]   It's in verse 20, "all the more."
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:40.060]   What that is all saying is that while Adam had an effect, Christ had much more of an
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060]   impact.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.040]   That's the comparison.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.780]   So let's see that comparison unfold, starting in verse 15.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.760]   But the free gift is not like the transgression; for if by the transgression of the one the
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.920]   many died.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.000]   Much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.180]   abound to the many.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.040]   The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand, the
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   judgment arose from one transgression, resulting in condemnation; but on the other hand, the
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.900]   free gift arose from many transgressions, resulting in justification; for if by the
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.840]   transgression of the one death reigned.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.620]   And reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.240]   the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.400]   So then, as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.220]   through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.760]   For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.800]   the obedience of the one the many will be made righteous.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.480]   The law came in so that transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:16.820]   all the more, so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.880]   to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   This is an amazing, powerful comparison.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:37.320]   Paul is going to show us that one man's act can affect everyone, as illustrated by Adam.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.440]   What Adam did affected people disastrously; what Christ did affects them blessedly.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   Now Paul uses contrasts here, and they have some distinctions, but they're a little overlapping.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.600]   I'm not going to take a lot of time, but I want you to see them, because I want you to
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.020]   come to the Lord's table tonight with a rich understanding of the wondrous work that he
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.040]   did at the cross.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:12.660]   The first contrast is as to the effectiveness of each man's act, the effectiveness of Adam's
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:21.580]   offense compared to the effectiveness of Christ's gift.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.520]   And verse 15 lays that out: "The free gift is not like the free gift."
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.160]   Now, the free gift is not like the transgression.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   There's a great distinction.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   This is the first much more distinction: "For if by the transgression of the one the many
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:44.100]   died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.900]   abound to the many."
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.840]   The free gift is not like the transgression, meaning that the free gift that came through
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.440]   the death and resurrection of Christ is not like the free gift.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.680]   The first is not like the transgression in Adam.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.460]   Transgression - strong word - per optima, meaning a full deviation, a trespass, an offense
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.920]   against God.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:20.680]   It was a powerful thing because as a result of it, Paul says, "Many died, many."
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.360]   The many is also the all.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.640]   If you go down further in the passage, as you'll see in a few moments, he uses "all."
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.380]   Here he uses "many" and "many," and later "all" and "all" in order to make his comparisons
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380]   clear.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.980]   "As a result of Adam, many died."
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980]   How many?
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.160]   "All who were in Adam."
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:55.280]   As a result of the charisma, the grace gift, the righteous act of Christ, "many."
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.820]   Many received forgiveness.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   How many?
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.440]   "All who were in Christ."
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.040]   All who were in Adam died by virtue of his deed.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.400]   All who were in Christ live eternally by virtue of what Christ did.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.660]   Now, how is the effectiveness of each act by one man different?
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.580]   Clearly, distinctively different.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.340]   By the transgression of Adam, what does it say in verse 15?
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.200]   "They died."
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.000]   "They died."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.840]   The sin of Adam killed the human race.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:38.100]   The one sin of that first man became the ground for the death of all human beings, and we
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.360]   know that because everybody dies.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   The many in verse 15 in the comparison is the all in verse 18, where you have the condemnation
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.120]   of all men compared to the justification of all men.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:05.660]   In the case of the many, it's all, and in the case of the all in verse 18, it's many.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.020]   You have to nuance your understanding of those terms.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:16.440]   But we do know that the sin of Adam killed the human race, and for the sake of analogy,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.780]   Paul keeps his comparisons, many, many, all, all, even though it is in the truest sense
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.040]   all who died.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.180]   And only many who live in Christ, for the sake of comparison, he uses those two terms
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.240]   interchangeably.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   The parallelism here is laid out in the one statement in 1 Corinthians 15:22, "As in Adam
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.580]   all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive."
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.680]   All who were in Adam died; all who were in Christ in His death were made alive.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.960]   The sin of Adam polluted all his posterity in sin and guilt.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   And ruin and judgment, the whole race represented by Adam as the head, and the consequence of
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:11.200]   his sin were on all his progeny, all who were, as it were, represented by Adam.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.900]   Much more, much more.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.960]   Jesus Christ does much more.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.880]   If the effect of Adam's sin was death, the much more is the effect of Christ's work is
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880]   life.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.220]   The evil gift of Adam is death; the grace gift of Christ is life.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.840]   Therefore, this is much more.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.340]   Christ is more powerful to save than Adam was to ruin.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.640]   Adam had the power to kill.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.220]   Much more, Christ has the power to make alive.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:51.440]   And Paul piles up his expressions regarding the "much more" in verse 15: "It is much
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.800]   more grace of God.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.500]   It is the gift of grace."
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:02.700]   It is in verse 17, again, the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.580]   This is the "much more."
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.580]   By one man, everyone died.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:17.140]   By one man, everyone in Christ receives eternal life.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:23.100]   And you have to notice that at the end of verse 15, it says, "This gift by the grace
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.720]   of the one man.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.540]   Jesus Christ abounds to many, abounds."
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.620]   He's using language here that is superlative.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.600]   It's over and above.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   It excels.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.820]   It's better than, superior than, more than.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:46.260]   And it's a way of saying that the evil from Adam has been more than conquered, more than
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.200]   neutralized.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.480]   It has been completely overpowered, completely canceled.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.640]   In Christ.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.080]   "For his received righteousness, holiness, reconciliation to God, and eternal life."
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.160]   Paul said to Timothy, and this is a way to understand it, that in the death of Christ,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:13.380]   he abolished death and brought forth life and immortality.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.800]   Sin in Adam destroyed by death.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:24.560]   Grace in Christ blesses by life.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.620]   Destruction or blessing.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.120]   It's eternal death or eternal life.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:35.080]   Yes, the impact of one act by one person.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.320]   Adam's effect can be nullified.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.160]   All who are in Christ have that nullified.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:52.720]   Christ's effect can never be nullified, because he purchased for us eternal life.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.480]   So the effect.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:01.540]   It's a perfect example of what Christ has done far surpasses, far beyond the damage
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.000]   that Adam did.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.100]   A second comparison is also one that looks at the actual extent of the distinctions between
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.100]   the two.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.660]   Let me have you look at that in verse 16.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.400]   The gift, that is the gift of salvation in Christ, is not like that.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   He says it again.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.920]   It's not like, again, as in verse 15, "Is not like that which came through the one who
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   sinned.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.520]   For on the one hand, the judgment arose from one transgression, resulting in condemnation;
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:47.880]   but on the other hand, the free gift arose from many transgressions, resulting in justification."
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.320]   So first of all, there is a huge distinction between an act that brings death to everyone,
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.000]   and an act that brings life to everyone.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.360]   Here he says it another way.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   Adam produced condemnation; Christ produced justification.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.460]   That's back to verse 16.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.940]   What is meant by the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:20.880]   For on the one hand, the judgment arose from one transgression, resulting in condemnation.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.240]   Not only did Adam's act sentence us to sin.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.540]   We have sin and corruption.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.860]   But it resulted in condemnation.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:38.480]   But on the other hand, what Christ did resulted in justification.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   Condemnation is to be declared unrighteous.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.240]   Justification is to be declared righteous.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.160]   Condemnation came by one sin, Adam.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.200]   Justification came by one Savior.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:06.900]   You could say it this way: "Condemnation came by one sin committed by Adam.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.760]   Justification cancels millions of sins.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.200]   The one transgression demanded the condemnation of all, nothing less.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.340]   But the free gift of justification is of such massive character and nature that it operates
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.080]   with regard to all."
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.400]   "All the sins of all those who are in Christ."
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   One sin in Adam damns the human race.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:45.040]   One righteous sacrifice by Christ forgives the numberless sins of all who are in Christ.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.460]   Condemnation determined by one sin.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.000]   Justification determined by one sacrifice for sin.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.560]   It makes everyone guilty.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:03.700]   Justification makes everyone righteous.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:11.060]   Grace is greater than all our sin, far greater.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:20.380]   The damage that Adam did by one sin set loose millions and trillions of sins, but the one
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.920]   act of Jesus Christ covers it.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:32.360]   It covers those sins for all who are in Christ.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.480]   Just think about it this way: if the whole human race suffered death because of Adam's
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:49.960]   sin and Christ bore the wrath of God for trillions and trillions of sins, how immense
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.840]   was that sacrifice?
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   How immense was that sin-bearing?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.040]   How incalculable was his suffering under the wrath of God?
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   If just one sin was bad enough to damn the entire human race, what must be the horror
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:23.760]   of being punished for all the sins of all people who would ever believe in one afternoon?
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.720]   The answer is, "The only thing that will ever be forgiven is the one who has sinned."
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   The earth will be the one that will be forgiven.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.060]   The righteous act of another makes you a king.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:22.440]   The distinction is great.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:38.300]   If what Adam did put you in bondage to sin, what Christ did gave you a throne in His kingdom.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.220]   The results of the grace, gift, and righteousness.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.800]   Completely overpower the results of sin.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.840]   Sin in Adam set us against God, and death reigned over us.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:59.780]   Righteousness in Christ set us right with God, and we reign over sin.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.800]   We reign not only in the future, but we reign in life now because sin no longer has dominion
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.140]   over us.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.720]   This shows up in another contrast.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:18.880]   This distinction, verses 18 and 19: "So then, as through one transgression there resulted
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.480]   condemnation to all men, even so through the one act of righteousness there resulted justification
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:32.180]   of life to all men, and then this: for as through the one man's disobedience the many
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:40.220]   were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one the many will be made righteous."
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:48.500]   The contrasts are between life and death and condemnation and justification, and now obedience
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.980]   and disobedience.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.740]   Disobedience corresponds to condemnation.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.380]   Obedience corresponds to justification.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.900]   Adam disobeys, and down comes condemnation.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.300]   Christ obeys, and down comes justification.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.600]   One man's disobedience.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.500]   One man.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.500]   One man.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.080]   His disobedience doesn't appear to be a mortal sin.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   He ate something he wasn't supposed to eat, but that was enough to make many sinners,
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.020]   the whole human race.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:31.200]   On the other hand, the obedience of one, a willingness to go to the cross and be a sacrifice
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.500]   for sin, overpowered that disobedience.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   And the obedience of Christ.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   The disobedience of one.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.500]   made us righteous.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   Why?
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.860]   Because His obedience is imputed to us.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.340]   We've said this through the years.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.620]   If you're a believer, your sin was imputed to Christ on the cross, and His righteousness
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.740]   was imputed to you, so that when God looks at you, He sees Christ.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.800]   All Adam's people are marked by disobedience.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.140]   All Christ's people are marked by obedience.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.160]   One man Adam, one man Christ.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.220]   The whole human race falls into one of those two categories.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.760]   They're either in Adam or in Christ.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:29.000]   In Adam they are dead, and they are condemned, and they are disobedient.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.680]   In Christ they are alive, and they are justified, and they are covered by the very obedience
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.780]   of Christ.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.620]   Christ is the one who is the Lord of all things.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.660]   He's the one who is the Lord of all things.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.160]   He is the one who is the Lord of all things.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.620]   He is the one who is the Lord of all things.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.100]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.280]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.400]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   He is the Lord of all things.
