[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.000]   All right, let's move on to some questions about deep work.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   Our first question comes from Jamie.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.000]   Jamie says, if you work a 9 to 5 job
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.780]   and would like to study part-time for postgraduate
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.120]   studies, what time management strategies would you suggest
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280]   or type of planning would you do,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.800]   as well as what techniques would you
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.280]   use to learn the information faster?
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.800]   Well, Jamie, if you're going to do academic work
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.960]   and you have time constraints-- like you have here,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.200]   you have a 9 to 5 job and you have to fit this around--
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.360]   deploying a strategy that I call the student workday
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.480]   is probably going to be particularly important.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.960]   Now, this is an idea that I used to expound back
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   in the early days of my blog when
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.880]   I was talking primarily to students
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.320]   who had busy schedules.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.900]   And the idea behind the student workday
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.760]   was to look at the classes you were taking
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000]   and then identify, what is the work that I know
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   has to happen on a repeated basis?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880]   Is it a reading assignments that have to get done every week,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.160]   a lab report that has to get written up every two weeks,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.320]   a problem set that has to be solved weekly,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   or whatever it is?
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   Figure out the work that you know happens repeatedly
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.840]   and answer the question of, when am I going to do that work?
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.520]   Same time, same days, every week.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640]   You actually put that on your calendar,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.480]   just like you have your dentist appointment or meeting
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.320]   a friend for drinks.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.640]   You have to figure this out.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   Now, you work a 9 to 5 job, so you might not
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.680]   have a lot of options, but the work has to get done.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.960]   So identify where that work is going to happen.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   Maybe you have an 8 AM to 9 AM block on a day
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.960]   that you work from home, and that's
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.000]   when you do the first draft of your problem set,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.200]   and you do that on Mondays.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.040]   And then after dinner, you do a 6 to 7 30
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   block to finish off that problem set.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.960]   Maybe you take 90 minutes out of the middle of the days
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.800]   on Wednesday to do your reading assignments,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.880]   because again, maybe you have some flexibility,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.720]   and you can find that time, and there's
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   a conference room in your office that you can go to that's
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.560]   quiet and a good place to do that work.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   But you figure out, this is all the work that
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.280]   has to get done on a regular basis.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.120]   This is when I do it, this time, this day.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.360]   I don't have to think about it.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760]   It's routine.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   Advanced tip here, throw in where that work happens.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.200]   OK, as long as I'm fixing when it happens,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.080]   why don't I also throw in where?
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.600]   So that I can find locations I associate just
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   with that work, and it leads to me shifting into a deep work
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.640]   mode quicker.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240]   So I go to this library to do this work.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   I have a home office in my basement for that work.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.680]   You want that ritual and routine surrounding this work.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.440]   What I'm trying to do for you here, Jamie,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   is get rid of any on the fly decision
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.200]   making about what should I do today, what's due soon.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.960]   That's what's going to get you in trouble.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.800]   If you just fly by the seat of your pants and say,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   oh man, I got something due tomorrow,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.240]   and I was at work, and I went to dinner,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.680]   and I went to the gym, and it's 8,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.440]   and it's going to take four hours,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   that's where you get into trouble.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.800]   So find when and where that work is going to happen.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640]   Fix on your calendar.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.800]   Stop thinking about scheduling.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.160]   Now what happens if you can't fit it?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.200]   It's just not reasonable.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.720]   You're taking up every evening, and it's
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   taking up all your hours, and you have no give.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.000]   You have no time for exercise.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.080]   You have no time for dinner.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   Well, now you are facing that productivity dragon.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   This is the reality.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.520]   I don't have time.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.200]   If you don't have time, you have to see you don't have time.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.600]   This happens more than you would think.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   There's a semi--
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.320]   well, famous to me--
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   I'll say important to me-- blog post I wrote years ago.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.360]   It must have been like 2008, maybe even 2007.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.280]   And it was about a student I was advising at MIT.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.040]   She didn't work a 9 to 5 job, but the number of activities
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   that she was involved with might as well have been a 9 to 5 job.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.640]   We went through this exercise.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.760]   What's everything you need to do on a regular basis?
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.200]   Let's find time for it on the calendar.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   And we couldn't fit it.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640]   We ran out of room.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.760]   And I said to her--
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.880]   her name was Lena--
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.760]   Lena, you obviously are doing too much.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.080]   I'm looking at this calendar.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.640]   We cannot actually fit the work.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.400]   The work is the work.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.240]   We can't fit it in.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.700]   We made it as efficient as possible.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.200]   We can't fit it in.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.920]   But she couldn't bear say no.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.880]   She couldn't sit and bear say no to things.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.600]   She couldn't take things off of her plate.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   The next semester, she had to go on leave for mental health.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.080]   It just completely overwhelmed her.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.680]   So I always say, you've got to face the productivity dragon
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.800]   here.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.880]   When am I going to do it?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   If you have time, good.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   And if you don't, you might want to rethink this plan.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.200]   Only then, once you know when this work is going to happen
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   and where it's going to happen, and it all
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.040]   fits nicely into your schedule, and you're not
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.280]   thinking about scheduling, and you're not
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.120]   making decisions on the fly, you're not staying up
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.040]   late all night because you forgot about your problem set
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.120]   until late the night before, once you've done all that,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.520]   then care about your study habits themselves.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.560]   You want to make these blocks as small as possible
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.520]   while still getting the work done well.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.920]   That comes down to how you study.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.080]   I would recommend my book, How to Become a Straight A Student,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   for a deep dive on how the most efficient students get
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.600]   their work done.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.000]   I will just give you two very brief hints about what
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.720]   you're going to find in there.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.920]   Hint number one, your work accomplished as a student
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   is the product of the time you spend
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.880]   and the intensity of your focus.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.680]   So if you are trying to do your schoolwork
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.960]   with a low intensity of focus, i.e.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.880]   you're looking at your phone, you're looking at email,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.600]   you're looking at Slack, you have the TV in the background,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.040]   it's going to take a lot more time in that equation
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.880]   to get the same amount of work done,
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.160]   versus if when you work, you're 100% focused,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.760]   that intensity of focus is maxed out,
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.040]   the time required to get the work done is going to go down.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.640]   You need to hack that equation if you're
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.960]   going to get this work done with a 9 to 5 job.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.520]   Two, banish the word study from your vocabulary.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.600]   That's way too vague, that's way too emotional.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.520]   You got to be instead incredibly specific.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.400]   For this type of work, how am I going to do it?
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.960]   And what evidence do I have that this
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   is the right way to do it?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.560]   How to become a straight A student will get you
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.600]   all those details, it'll walk you down that path,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.520]   but those are the big picture summaries
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.440]   of what you might find.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.840]   All right, so summary, schedule all your work in advance,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.360]   you know when it's going to happen.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.980]   And then two, get very serious about your work habits
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.680]   once that time set aside.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.920]   That's your best bet to succeed with studies,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.800]   with a full time job, without making your life
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.640]   into a joyless grind.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
