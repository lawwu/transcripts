[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 5 and verse 32, the
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.160]   32nd verse, in the fifth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. "And we
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.880]   are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.120]   given to them that obey him." Let me read from verse 29. "Then Peter and the other
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.600]   apostles answered and said, 'We are to obey God rather than men.' The God of our
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.720]   fathers raised up Jesus, whom he slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.600]   with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance to Israel
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.640]   and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him." We interrupt our
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.400]   studies in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians because it seems to me to be a
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.840]   very great importance at a time such as this particularly that we should all be
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.840]   clear as Christian people as to what we mean by "witsambi," what it represents in
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.240]   the history of the Church and its message therefore for the Church at this
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   present hour. And we do so this morning in terms of this statement here in this
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.000]   32nd verse of the fifth chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles. The
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.880]   immediate context is not of vital importance in the elucidation of the
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.480]   particular statement. The Apostles had been on trial once more for preaching
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.360]   Jesus and the resurrection. They had been arrested more than once, and they had
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.320]   been prohibited severely to preach any more or to do anything in the name of
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600]   this Jesus. And here we are given the reply of Peter and the other Apostles.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.880]   They say we ought to obey God rather than men. And then they proceed to state
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.320]   the basic simple facts of the Christian faith. And then they had this most
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.840]   important statement that we are looking at. They said, "Now we are witnesses of
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   these things, that God raised up Jesus and how they had slain him and hanged
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   him on a tree, and how God had exalted him with his right hand." They say we are
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.000]   witnesses of these things. And then this most extraordinary phrase, "And so is also
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.400]   the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him." Very well. Here you
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.360]   see these men preaching soon after that great and notable event which happened
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.800]   on the day of Pentecost, the account of which is recorded there in that second
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.040]   chapter. And they are referring, of course, partly to that in what they say here.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.400]   What then are we reminded of? Well, the first thing is, of course, that this is a
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.640]   fact. This is an event in history. This is something that literally and actually
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.360]   happened. We can never repeat that too frequently. Christianity is not primarily
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.880]   a teaching. It's not a philosophy. It is a teaching which is based upon facts. The
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.640]   teaching is nothing but an explanation of the facts. We are saved not by the
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.520]   teaching. We are saved by what God has actually done for us men and for our
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   salvation. That is why the tedium that we sang just now is so important for us. It
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.800]   reminds us of the events and of the facts. No teaching could save men.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.560]   Something had to be done, and something has been done. And we're reminded, I say,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.240]   that what happened on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem is one of that
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:30.280]   great series of events, of facts, in this story of salvation. You remember there
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   how those people at Jerusalem hearing these disciples speaking in different
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   languages said the thing that astounded them was that we hear them speak, they
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.720]   said, in our own tongues, the wonderful works of God. That's it, the wonderful
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   works of God. That's what Christianity is. It is what has come into being as the
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.240]   result of the wonderful works and actions of God. And the last in that
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.840]   great series of actions was what took place at Jerusalem on the day of
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   Pentecost. Suddenly the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, was poured forth upon those
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   people in the upper room. Now this, I say, is an actual fact. It is a literally
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.680]   event and happening. There they were gathered together in that room, and
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.640]   suddenly there was a sound of a rushing mighty wind. Now this is not imagination.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.000]   This is not just a pictorial way of representing something. That literally
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.960]   happened. The place was filled with this sound, and then there descended the
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.160]   cloven tongues as of fire upon the head of every single one of the company in
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.480]   the upper room, and they began to speak with other tongues. Now my dear friends,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.760]   it's so vital we should remember this because it is quite certain we would not
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.480]   be here in this chapel at this moment if that had not literally happened. There
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.400]   would never have been a Christian church. There would have been no message to
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.280]   preach. This, then, I say, is the first thing which we must take a firm hold on.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.200]   And as I'm saying, never was it more important that we should do so than at
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:28.160]   this present time. We worship a God who acts, who intervenes, who does things. I
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.080]   would certainly not be in this pulpit if I felt that the Christian church were in
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.520]   the hands of men, any men. If I felt that the future of the church were in my
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.560]   hands, I say I'd never be in a pulpit at all. I would be of all men the most
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.440]   pessimistic. No, no. The thing we are reminded of is this, that this is God's
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.400]   plan and God's purpose. God has planned before the foundation of the world the
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.360]   salvation of his people and he's going to perform it. That's the great message
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.040]   of the Bible. You see these long intervals when God seemed to have
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.360]   forgotten his own purpose, forgotten his own people. The enemy is loud and
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.120]   arrogant and proud. Nothing happens. Everything's going wrong. And suddenly
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   God arises and goes on with the plan. Now this great event, I say, on the day of
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.280]   Pentecost is just a reminder of all this. This is the thing, you see, that finally
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.480]   put heart and power and vigor into the testimony of those crest-formed disciples.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.840]   And thank God that we can meet there for on such a day and remind ourselves of
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.040]   this notable event, that we are in the hands of God and that at any time when
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.360]   it is pleasing to him in his sovereign will, he can again shed forth his spirit
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.520]   and revive his work and lift up his own people and send them out to do mighty
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.200]   deeds and achieve great conquests in the name of his dear Son. Thank God, I say, for
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:02.000]   Whit Sunday. Thank God for the facts and the events on which our faith is based.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.800]   And Christian people, let us never forget the facts. Let us hold firmly to them.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   That's why we thank God for bread and wine. We are so ready to philosophize
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.560]   that death is everything else, but here we are reminded that he was nailed to a
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.120]   tree, his body was broken, his blood was shed. Facts! Let's hold on to the facts.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.760]   But now we are concerned to understand truly the meaning of the fact. What was
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:36.080]   it exactly that happened? What is this teaching concerning the Holy Ghost, which
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.880]   we have in the New Testament? Now, here I say it is of great importance that we
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:50.320]   should be clear, because, as you know, in the long history of the Church there have
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.800]   been so many false and wrong notions and ideas and teachings with respect to the
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:05.840]   work of the Holy Spirit and the true doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit. This
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.040]   is to me a very tragic thing. There have been two main tendencies with regard to
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   this matter. There have been some who have exaggerated the teaching concerning
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:25.360]   the Holy Spirit, and they have gone to excesses. And the tragedy is that because
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   they have done that, the effect has been upon the others very often, to make them
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.600]   neglect the doctrine of the Holy Spirit altogether. It's so difficult to arrive at
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.520]   a balance, isn't it, with these matters. There are fanatical people, people who
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   talk about nothing but the Holy Spirit, and I say they become guilty of excesses
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.600]   in so many different ways. Then the others, looking on and seeing how
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.440]   obviously wrong that is, become so frightened and so alarmed that they go
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.120]   right over to the other side, and you never hear them mentioning the Holy
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.640]   Spirit at all. He seems to have dropped out of their theology almost. We are such
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   creatures of reactions, and thus we go from one extreme right over to the other.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.320]   Well, the danger is still with us. Still with us. There are people who are still
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.680]   guilty of fanaticism and of confusion with regard to the doctrine of the Holy
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.920]   Spirit, and who bring the entire teaching into disrepute. And on the other hand, I
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.400]   say there are those who practically never speak of him at all, and who are not
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.560]   concerned about revival, because they're afraid of these excesses. Very well, let's
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.480]   see what the Scripture teaches us about this whole matter. And here, it seems to
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   me, it is put before us in a very convenient way. The first thing we read
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.920]   is this, that the Holy Ghost is in his function primarily and essentially a
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   witness. I don't stay this morning with the doctrine of the person of the Spirit.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.640]   There's no time for that. I'm assuming that we all agree that the Holy Spirit is
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   a person and not merely an influence. He is the third person in the Blessed
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.400]   Holy Trinity. But we are concerned here with his work, his function, in this
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.480]   matter of salvation. And here is the first thing, he's a witness. We are
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.200]   witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost. Now, here surely is the
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:32.660]   key to a true scriptural balanced view of the work of the Holy Spirit. He is a
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:40.320]   witness, yes, and he is a witness together with, so is also together with, the
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   Apostles. We are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost. Now,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:53.400]   here is a very great and important principle. The work and function of the
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   Holy Ghost, in other words, must never be taken on its own, must never be isolated.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.740]   It must always be taken in connection with this other witness. Now, here of
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:16.320]   course Peter and the Apostles put it in terms of their own words and teaching
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.280]   at that very time. Peter said, "We are witnesses, that's the meaning of
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.600]   our preaching, that's why we work these miracles. We are witnesses of these
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.200]   things, we saw them, we are testifying as to their reality and the truth
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.280]   concerning them. Therefore, they said, "We are teaching these things of
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   which we are witnesses." Now, the Holy Ghost is a witness with us of these
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.120]   selfsame things. What is the position now then? Well, the position now is this.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.400]   The Apostles are not here. Well, where is that aspect of the witness, you say? The
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:59.160]   answer is in this word, in this book. This, you see, is the witness of the Apostles.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   That was, as you remember, the determining factor in the formation of the New
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.680]   Testament canon. The Holy Spirit was guiding the early church in the
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.920]   formation of this canon. There were many books suggested to them and offered to
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.040]   them. They excluded a large number and they decided to incorporate these only.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.520]   What was their ultimate test? Well, the ultimate test was the test of
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.400]   apostolicity, which means this, that it had to be established beyond any doubt
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   whatsoever that these books were either written by an apostle or else could be
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.360]   directly traced to an apostle. Nothing else was admitted at all. However good it
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   might be, however excellent the teaching, if it did not come up to this test of
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:55.320]   apostolicity, it was rejected. Very well, the New Testament is nothing but the
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.720]   witness of the testimony of the Apostles to the truths of salvation, to the facts
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   and the teaching. Here it is. We, said these men, are his witnesses of these
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.360]   things, and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.080]   Now then, here I say is a very great and profound principle. And if the church had
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:25.440]   always remembered that, she would have avoided many a heresy and many an error.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.520]   Most of the trouble has arisen through a separation of the Spirit and the Word,
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.960]   through the separation of the Spirit and the testimony of the Apostles. Some have
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.400]   put their entire emphasis upon the Spirit. Others have put their exclusive
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:50.560]   emphasis upon the Word. Now there's no more fascinating study than the study of
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.760]   these two things. Let me give you just a hurried illustration to show you the
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:09.000]   kind of trouble that arises when this great principle is forgotten. The Quakers,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.440]   people like the early Quakers in particular, were guilty, of course, of
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.760]   putting their whole emphasis upon the Spirit. That was the meaning of their
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.720]   teaching of the inner light. And they were not the only ones. There had been
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.360]   some fanatical sects even before them on the continent of Europe. You can read
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   their story, and of the fight of people like Luther and Calvin against them.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   These were people who said that they really didn't need the Word, they didn't
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.760]   need the Scriptures at all. They were being given direct revelations by the
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.440]   Spirit. This is no use coming to us and saying that that isn't taught in the
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.200]   Bible. We're not interested. The Holy Spirit is in us. There is an inner light.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.560]   We are being led into the truth. It's coming directly and immediately to us.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   So they didn't expand the Scriptures, but they sat in silence and got their
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.760]   messages as they said, and then they preached. Now that has always been a
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.180]   cause of great confusion. You see, such people claim that they are receiving a
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.960]   fresh revelation, that truth doesn't end with the Scriptures, but that you can get
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.880]   fresh, additional, new revelations. That the Spirit alone is still operating
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:28.640]   apart from these other witness and testimony. And so I say you get the key to
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.360]   the understanding of all the fanatical sects that have troubled the life of the
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.960]   Church. Of course, the history will tell you that they were not only wrong in
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.520]   that respect, but that, as is almost invariably the case, it led to moral
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.000]   failure. There was no standard by which you could test them. If they claimed
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.040]   they've got authority from God for everything they did and said, well, there
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.280]   was no court of appeal. And the result is that such sects generally ended in some
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.440]   moral confusion and some kind of shame. In any case, they've nearly all wandered
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.960]   far away from the Scriptural teaching, so that some of them by now can scarcely be
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.600]   described as Christian at all. There's one such. Then there is another
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.040]   interesting phenomenon, and that is, of course, what you get in the Roman
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:24.720]   Catholic Church. Now, the Roman Catholic Church does not reject the testimony of
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.360]   the Scriptures, the Word, the Apostles, but it is still guilty of this same error of
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.940]   separating these two things. The position of the Roman Church, as you know, that it
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.720]   accepts this teaching, but says that since then there has been further
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.080]   teaching, that the Holy Ghost is still giving his message directly, that
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.680]   the revelation of truth did not end with the Apostles, but it's still
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.960]   continuing. And so, you see, they teach papal infallibility, they teach the
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.680]   assumption of the Virgin Mary, they teach the Immaculate Conception, and many other
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.480]   things which are not taught in the Scripture at all. But they're in no
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.960]   trouble. They say, "Oh no, of course they're not in the Scripture, but the Holy Ghost
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.400]   has revealed this to the Church since then. There has been a fresh impartation
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.920]   of truth." Now, that again violates what we are taught so clearly in this
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:26.960]   particular verse. These two witnesses must always go together, and whatever
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.800]   purpose to be a revelation by the Holy Spirit which is not confirmed in this
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.280]   book must be rejected. Here is the apostolic witness, and what the Holy
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   Ghost does is to witness with the apostolic witness. And if you can't prove
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.520]   that a thing is a part of the apostolic witness, it must be utterly rejected. Now,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.880]   there, I say, is a very important principle for us always to be bearing in
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.920]   our minds. And then there's just one other group I must mention, and that is
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.600]   the group that more or less excludes the Holy Spirit, and is interested only in
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.080]   this word. And it comes to this word with a kind of rational mind and
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:20.360]   understanding. The operation of the Spirit is almost entirely excluded. This
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.640]   has often happened in the history of the Church, and that is how you can have such
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   a thing as a dead orthodoxy. There have been many such periods in the history of
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.360]   the Church, when men have been absolutely orthodox, they've believed the word from
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.280]   cover to cover, but there has been no life whatsoever. Why? Well, they've
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.160]   excluded the witness of the Spirit, and they have regarded the teaching of
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.320]   Christianity as just a kind of intellectual exposition of the
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.220]   propositions of this book. It's a reasoned argument, a logical statement of
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.040]   facts and of teachings. It's been absolutely orthodox, but completely dead.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.600]   It's been right about the witness of the Apostles, but it has forgotten the
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.160]   witness of the Holy Ghost. And of course, that is equally bad. Some of the driest,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.000]   most arid periods in the history of the Church have been those
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.320]   periods of a dead mechanical orthodoxy. Well, my friends, I can't stay with this
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.640]   this morning. I want to touch on general principles, but here is the first and the
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:31.080]   starting point. So is also word and spirit. God forbid we should ever divide
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.240]   them, separate them. God forbid that we should emphasize one only without the
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.800]   other, doesn't matter which of them. These two things work together, have been
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.600]   meant to work together, and we separate them, I say, only at the cost of a
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.800]   departure from the true Christian faith. There's the first point. Secondly, what is
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   it to which the Holy Ghost witnesses? He is a witness, primarily, in his operation.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:06.240]   To what does he witness? And here again, you see, is the most important statement.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:13.680]   Negatively, he doesn't witness to himself. Oh, how many have gone wrong there. Having
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.200]   understood that there is a doctrine of the Holy Spirit, they see nothing but
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.040]   this, and they talk about the Holy Spirit alone in and of himself, but that's wrong.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.960]   He's a witness to something else. The Holy Ghost, my friends, never calls
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.240]   attention to himself alone. Indeed, we can go further. He never calls attention to
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:40.920]   himself as such. It is always in this context. So I say that if we are looking
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:46.360]   to the Holy Ghost alone and in isolation, we are again in error. Or, look at it
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:53.940]   like this. He does not witness only to certain phenomena. Now, this is where the
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.240]   fanatical sects go wrong always. You will find that they've got great emphasis on
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.920]   the Holy Spirit, yes, but they're always talking about phenomena. They're always
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.680]   talking about tongues, or miracles, or this or that, or direct leading and
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:15.000]   guidance. It's always the phenomena that's the thing that interests them. And that is,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.680]   you see, to be utterly opposed to the New Testament teaching concerning the
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.320]   witness of the Holy Ghost. He doesn't stop at the phenomena. There are
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.760]   phenomena, as I'm going to show you, but he never focuses his beam, as it were, upon
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.840]   them alone, and leaves us just talking about phenomena, and interested in
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.640]   phenomena. Now, there are books in which you can read of the story of fanaticism
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.480]   and you will find that that has always been its great characteristic. They've
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.360]   spent their time in talking to one another about what they felt, or what
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.840]   they've seen, how suddenly a ball of fire appeared, or how they suddenly had some
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.720]   great sensation going through their body as if a hot iron were pushed. That's the
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   kind of thing to which they testify, and this is what establishes them as unusual
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.160]   Christians. Phenomena, excitement, and they talk about them. All the interest is
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:10.240]   there in the phenomena. I wish I'd got more time to develop this for this
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   reason. This question of phenomena becomes always in revival one of the
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.720]   most acute problems. There has scarcely ever been a revival but that you've had
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   certain phenomena, I believe, given by the Holy Ghost. Yes, but men suddenly
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.400]   concentrate their attention on the phenomena. They forget the Holy Ghost and
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.480]   the one to whom he witnesses, and they're looking at the phenomena and talking
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.980]   about them and seeking them. And so many a revival has led to trouble and has
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:47.200]   come to a kind of abortive end because this vital principle of the word and the
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.680]   spirit together and making sure as to what the spirit testifies and witnesses
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.160]   unto has been forgotten. No, no, he doesn't call attention to himself. He doesn't call
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.360]   attention to phenomena and mere experiences. Well, to what? Well, the Word
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.600]   tells us. And we are his witnesses of what? Well, of these things. These things.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:16.400]   And so is also the Holy Ghost a witness of what? Well, these things. These things.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.720]   Here's the test, you see, as to whether the spirit is working in us. I'm not
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.400]   interested in your experiences and the marvelous things you may have seen or
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.440]   felt or heard. The question is, has the spirit been witnessing to you to these
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.760]   things? What are they? Well, the Apostle has just been telling us what they are.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.320]   They're about the Lord, you see. Here are the things. The God, we ought to
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.840]   obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom he slew and
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.240]   hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.800]   savior, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:02.480]   witnesses of these things. There, those are the things. You know, in saying all
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.200]   this, the Apostles are just repeating, of course, what our Lord himself had
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.960]   prophesied. Listen to this. In John 14, 26. Here's our Lord preaching, and this is
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.560]   what he says. "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:28.680]   in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.040]   whatsoever I have said unto you." That's what he's going to do. He's going to bring
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.240]   back to the remembrance the things that he had already said unto. That's going to
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.560]   be his teaching. Not something new and strange, but these things which our Lord
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.080]   himself had been teaching. Then listen to it again in a still greater, a more
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   explicit statement, in a way, in chapter 16. I read verses 8 to 11. Here is our
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.080]   Lord prophesying of the coming of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, and
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.160]   when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.640]   judgment. Now, I've read many sermons on that and heard many sermons on it. And
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:18.440]   you know, sometimes they have dealt with that statement in such a way as to deny
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.200]   our Lord's own teaching. They've dealt, of course, with the whole question of
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.720]   conviction and conversion. But listen to our Lord's exposition. See what he means
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.920]   by that. He will convict the world and reprove the world of sin and of
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:40.560]   righteousness and of judgment. Of sin, how? Well, by showing the horrors of
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.520]   nightclubs or of public houses or of juvenile delinquency? Oh no. Of sin,
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:55.160]   because they believe not on me. That's sin. It's in relationship to the person.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:01.000]   Of righteousness, ah, there they expand, of course, how to live. Oh no. Of righteousness,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.960]   because I go to my Father and ye see me no more. Of judgment, how? Well, again, a
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.640]   great fact, because the Prince of this world is judged. And how is he judged?
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   He's already told them in chapter 12, it is by his crucifixion. He says, "Now is the
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.440]   Prince of this world cast out." So you see, the work of the Holy Spirit in
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:30.840]   convincing of sin and righteousness and of judgment is entirely in terms of our
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.000]   Lord's own person. And we must never forget this. We must never consider his
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.080]   work in conviction even, and convincing of sin, apart from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:48.920]   And then you get it again in verses 14 and 15. Listen to this. "He shall glorify
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   me." Not himself. "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall show
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.400]   it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine, therefore said I that he
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   shall take of mine and shall show it unto you." Our Lord tells us beforehand
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.720]   that the work of the Holy Spirit is not to call attention to himself or to
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   glorify himself or certain phenomena and experiences. No, no, "He shall glorify me, he
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:24.840]   shall take of mine and teach them to you." The Holy Ghost is a witness of these
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   things. What are these things? What is it the Holy Ghost witnesses unto? Well, you
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:40.520]   can divide it up, can't you? The person of the Lord, the facts concerning him, and the
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:47.560]   message of salvation resulting from those facts. Here's Peter's perfect summary of it
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.760]   all. The God of our fathers, raised up Jesus. Now, that's not a reference to the
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.240]   resurrection, you know. That comes later. When he means "raised up Jesus," he means
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:06.520]   the whole fact of the incarnation and the earthly life of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:14.160]   The Holy Ghost witnesses to that. The business of the Holy Ghost is to display
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.560]   the Lord Jesus Christ. "He shall glorify me." So, you see, the Apostle Paul is so
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.920]   right when he says in 1 Corinthians 12, 3, "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord,
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:34.600]   but by the Holy Ghost." What the Holy Ghost does is to teach us that Jesus is the Lord.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.960]   The Holy Ghost has been sent that the world may know about the Lord Jesus
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.500]   Christ. So, you see, you don't look at him. He wants you to look at the other. He
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.880]   points you there. And if the Holy Spirit is in you, you won't be looking at him.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.520]   You'll be looking at the Lord Jesus Christ, this blessed person. The God of our
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:30:00.320]   fathers raised up Jesus. Who is Jesus? Well, he's a prince. He's a Savior, Prince.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.040]   Peter's already described him in chapter 3 as the Prince of Life, which means the
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:11.760]   author of life. He's the author of life. He is the leader of salvation, the Son of
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   God, the whole mystery of the incarnation, his extraordinary life. The Holy Ghost
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.160]   teaches us about that, opens our eyes to that, enables us to see. He witnesses to
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.080]   that, always the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. And then, as I say, the facts, of
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.960]   course, about his life and his death and his resurrection, whom he slew and hanged
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:45.480]   on a tree. The death, the meaning of that death. Without the Holy Ghost, no man
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:52.520]   understands that death. Paul tells the Corinthians, "You're making the cross of
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.960]   Christ of none effect with your philosophy." It's only the Holy Ghost who
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.480]   exposes the meaning of the death upon the cross. What else? "Him hath God exalted
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.280]   with his right hand to be a prince and Savior." There's your resurrection.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:14.200]   There's your ascension. There is the heavenly session at the right hand of
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:21.960]   God. God exalting him. It's all. You see, as Paul puts it in that great passage in
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:29.280]   Philippians 2, "Humbled himself even to the death of the cross. Wherefore God
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.640]   hath highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name," and so on.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.280]   Now, here are the great facts of his life and his death and his resurrection. And
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:45.440]   then the other thing he adds is this, "For to give repentance to Israel and
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:52.560]   forgiveness of sins." In other words, the business of the Holy Ghost is first and
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.800]   foremost to give us the facts and the truth concerning the person, all that he
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   did, all that happened to him, and then the meaning of all that. Repentance,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.680]   salvation in his name, he and he alone can give this. You see, it's all a
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.480]   repetition of what our Lord himself had prophesied. Listen to him in the last
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.680]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, where just before his ascension he
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.400]   opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures and said
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.280]   unto them, "Thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.120]   from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.440]   be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem." There you
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.560]   see it is once more, the person, the facts, and the message concerning it,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:47.120]   repentance and belief of the truth. Now this, I say, is the work and the business
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:54.080]   and the witness of the Holy Spirit. Let me ask a final question. How does he do
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:01.440]   this? How does he bear this witness and this testimony? That's what he is. How does
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.200]   he do it? Well, here are some headings for you to work out. He does it by his very
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:15.280]   coming. What happened on the day of Pentecost is a witness and a testimony
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.000]   to the Lord Jesus Christ and the truth about him. How? Well, in this way. He had
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.720]   promised that he would come. Do you know that the whole case for the deity of
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:32.400]   Christ, in a sense, is suspended upon this fact? He had solemnly told them, "It is
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.600]   expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.160]   come unto you, but if I go away I will send him unto you." Categorically. "I will
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.280]   not leave you orphans. I will not leave you alone. He, when he is come," he told
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.000]   them deliberately, "not many days hence," he said, "you stay here where you are, not
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.680]   many days hence you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost." And they were. So the
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.720]   very coming of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost is a witness to the truth
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:09.280]   concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his work. What else? Well, the external signs,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   of course. The tongues of fire, the speaking with other languages, the
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:21.280]   miracles. These are all absolute proofs. And do you notice the way in which the
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.360]   apostles always used it? Do you remember Peter and John healing that lame man at
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.600]   the beautiful gate of the temple? And then there was the great commotion, and
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.680]   the authorities come and say, "What's the meaning of this?" And the people were
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.280]   almost worshipping Peter and John. And Peter and John turned on them and said,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.200]   "Why are you looking on us as if our own power or sanctity, we had given this
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:48.360]   man power to walk?" And then what does he go on to say? Does he go on to say, "Now, you
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.400]   know, we're able to do this because we've been baptized with the Holy Ghost."
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:35:01.600]   That isn't what he said at all. He refers them to the Lord Jesus Christ. Listen to
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:07.000]   his words. He says, "Why look ye on us? Why marvel ye at this? Or look ye so
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.280]   earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.360]   to walk. The God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.280]   glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denied him in the
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.080]   presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. You killed the
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.600]   Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. And
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:35.640]   his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know."
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.200]   You see, they don't talk about the Holy Ghost, they talk about Jesus. The Holy
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.080]   Ghost always witnesses to him. All the miracles and the signs, they all point to
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.120]   him, not to the Holy Ghost, not to themselves. Always the glorification of
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.720]   Jesus. And how else does he do it? Well, he does it, of course, in the individual,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.600]   his work in the individual. What is conviction of sin but a part of this?
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   The Holy Spirit bringing us to see our need of Christ. Conviction. Then
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   illumination. No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. No man
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.440]   will understand, I say, the meaning of his life, his death, his resurrection,
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:28.560]   justification by faith only, except by the Holy Ghost. Illumination, the
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.080]   understanding, the unction, the anointing of the Holy One in the mind. It's the
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:39.560]   work of the Spirit, but all along in terms of Jesus Christ. Sin is not to
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.080]   recognize him and to reject him and to try to live without him. And then
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:49.120]   illumination, he's the Savior. Repentance and faith, he gives forgiveness of sins.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:56.360]   What else? He gives us assurance. Look at the assurance given to Peter and the rest.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:03.480]   Look at the joy that was given them. And it's joy in the Lord Jesus Christ. It's
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.320]   joy in our relationship to him and in what he's going to do for us. Yes,
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:14.400]   assurance of salvation, certainty and joy. And then this mighty unction and power
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.160]   in preaching. Look at Peter on the day of Pentecost, standing up against the
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.520]   authorities and that gang saying, "Bob," and preaching with a holy boldness until
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.040]   they're convicted and cry out in agony saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.320]   do?" That's what happens, I say, in every great period of revival. The power, the
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.960]   unction, the authority of the Holy Ghost. And what's he doing? Witnessing to this
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:46.040]   Jesus and the truth concerning him. And so my last item in my list is revival.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.280]   Every revival is the Holy Ghost witnessing in power anew and afresh to
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:57.320]   these things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. There's never been a revival but
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.080]   they've always been singing about the death and about the blood. Oh yes, they
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.400]   sing about him, the Christ who loved us, who died for our sins, who was risen
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.000]   again for our justification, and the blood of Christ. They're the great themes
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.520]   of revival. Read your hymn books. Read the hymn books of the hymns written 200
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.440]   years ago in England and in Wales. And the great hymns are about the person of
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.920]   the Lord Jesus, lover of my soul, Christ, O thou, O Christ, of all I want. They're
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:35.200]   all about him, the Holy Spirit inspiring men to see him, his person, his beauty, his
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:42.600]   glory, his work, and all that he does. That's how the Holy Spirit bears his
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:53.760]   witness. So I end by asking my question again. Is he thus witnessing to you?
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.960]   Would you like to know whether you have received the Holy Ghost or not? Here's the
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.280]   simple test. I don't care whether you've had visions or not. I don't care whether
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.960]   you've seen your room filled with a ball of fire or not. I don't care whether you
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.480]   have trembled or not. I don't care whether you've heard strange voices or
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:19.600]   not. What I ask you is this. Is the Lord Jesus Christ everything to you? Do you
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.760]   know him as the Son of God, as the Lord of glory? Do you know him as your personal
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:34.240]   Savior and Redeemer? Have you felt the power of his blood? Do you know anything
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.160]   about the fellowship of his sufferings and the power of his resurrection? My
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.760]   friend, you can tell very easily whether the Holy Ghost is in you or not. If the
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:50.440]   Holy Ghost is in you, well then, Jesus Christ is precious to you. It's what you
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.600]   say about him that matters, not what you say about your experiences and
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:06.200]   phenomena. He always glorifies him. These things, Prince, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, the
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.000]   one whom you've seen and whom you love and for whose sake you're ready to leave
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.280]   everything, that's the test of the Spirit. And when a man is filled with the Spirit,
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.160]   nothing matters to him except this blessed Lord, that I might know him and
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:26.720]   the power of his resurrection and always live to his glory. Is he witnessing to
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:33.200]   these things in you? Would you have him do so? Well, here is the way. And so is the
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:40.680]   Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him. Obey him. Repent, believe
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.640]   on him, follow him. Don't stop at intellectual belief. Follow him, obey him,
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.160]   put into practice what he taught. Go after him. Deny yourself, take up the
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:41:00.040]   cross, follow him. God hath given the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. So if you
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.960]   want this blessed witness, if you want to know something of the experience of
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:12.520]   Pentecost, that's the way. Believe on him, follow him, plead with him to fill you
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:18.960]   with his Spirit and to manifest himself to you through this blessed witness.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:25.240]   Thank God for this word. You and I can then become witnesses of these things.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.400]   We'll see and understand the word and the Spirit will bear witness with our
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   spirits that we are the children of God. Amen.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:47.200]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
