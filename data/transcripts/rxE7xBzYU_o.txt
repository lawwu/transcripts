[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   OpenAI have just released their API endpoints for TrackGPT.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.900]   What we're going to do is have a quick look at what that looks like
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.500]   and how we can actually use it.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.200]   So they've just announced it in this article here, introducing
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600]   TrackGPT and Whisper APIs.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.500]   Now, I'm not going to talk about Whisper APIs, but we've covered them before.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500]   So you can go and watch those videos if you're interested.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.460]   But what is really exciting is TrackGPT, finally, we can use it through
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.500]   the API, which is pretty cool.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000]   Now, this article doesn't really cover anything.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.100]   They just kind of mentioned this, which is pretty impressive.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.100]   So the cost reduction, and if we scroll down, I think they are more
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700]   specific about it elsewhere, but we'll cover that in a moment.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.360]   But if we scroll down, we just see a couple of use cases, which is pretty cool.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   So you have Snapchat using it, these guys who I'm not really familiar
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.900]   with, Instacart, I think we also have Shopify here, which is pretty cool.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.000]   They have TrackGPT, which is providing a chat interface, but they're also
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.940]   pulling in information from elsewhere.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.040]   So, you know, they're doing the whole knowledge base thing here and feeding
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.900]   that information into the chat interface.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.740]   And we see more in-depth example of that here from Toby, who's the CEO of Shopify.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.900]   And you see that they're bringing all these other resources and kind of fine
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.700]   tuning what they're searching for based on that.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.300]   Now returning back to the 2ChatGPT, let's come up here and we have somewhere near
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.900]   the bottom of the article, we have a little bit of code here, and it's just above this
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.560]   that they mentioned the price difference.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.900]   So this is the ChatGPT model.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.740]   All right, so if you've used OpenAI's endpoints before, you probably
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.600]   are familiar with Text Adventure 0.0.3.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.700]   Now what we can use is this model, which is apparently pretty easy to migrate
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840]   from, small amount of adjustment needed to their prompts.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.460]   Yeah, and it's a lot cheaper.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.860]   It's a 10 times cheaper than existing GPT 3.5 models, which were
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.660]   already pretty cheap to start with.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.900]   So this is seemingly better performance than this, and it's also 10 times cheaper.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.540]   So it's a pretty good upgrade.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.460]   Now we have some demo code here, and then we can come to here
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.340]   to get a more in-depth guide.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.200]   So we have chat completions, go down and some code here, right?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.140]   I'm going to basically replicate this here.
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.540]   So we come to here, all I've done here is just pip and sort OpenAI.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.540]   I come to here, I set my API key.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.800]   Now to get that API key, you need to go to platform.openai.com.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.460]   You should see in the top right, there's like a signup or your actual account.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.400]   So you go into there, view API keys, and then you just click create
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.600]   a secret key here and get going.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.700]   That secret key would go in here and then we would come to here.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.000]   So this is our chat completion, create.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.740]   So kind of what you just saw right here.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.440]   So let me just copy this and we'll try it.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.760]   So this is literally my first time trying this.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.940]   So let's run this and just see what we get.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.540]   All right.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.540]   So finish reason start context.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.740]   So we get this.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.400]   I haven't read this conversation.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.860]   Was it who won the World Series in 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers?
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.000]   Where was it played?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.020]   It was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.020]   Okay.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.020]   That's pretty cool.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.160]   Now what's probably more interesting is if we, you know, I want to see if this
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.460]   is actually the same model as what we would be getting from ChatGPT, like
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.260]   through their actual interface.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.220]   So I had a quick conversation earlier.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.360]   It was, so I just asked, you know, what are sentence transformers?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.020]   Gave me a bit of an explanation.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.220]   Can you show me how to implement something like this?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.160]   For question answering, gave me tip glasses.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.260]   You know, it wasn't great.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.960]   Give me some models that I, you know, wouldn't recommend using.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.280]   So I asked it, can you fix that?
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.880]   You know, so on.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.980]   So I'm going to take these, let's just see how we'd actually implement
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.020]   this, but through the Python API.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.380]   So I'm going to take my first question.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.520]   Now here we have web user, so system user assistant, right?
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.120]   So this system here is like the primer for the model.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   So this is kind of like before the chat.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.320]   So this is before I even say anything up here.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.220]   So we can just leave it as you are a helpful assistant.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.180]   I don't know if that's going to produce the same sort of result as what we just
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.360]   got, but let's try and let's just say, you know, what are sentence transformers?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   See what we get.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.260]   Okay.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.160]   Sentence transformers are a class of deep learning models that are specifically
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   designed to generate high quality sentence embeddings.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.220]   Okay.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.660]   And let's compare that to what we've got on the other side.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.460]   Okay.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.360]   Uh, it's pretty similar, but this one is, I would say significantly longer.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.280]   So I imagine it's probably a token limit that we can set up here.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.020]   Let's take a look.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.820]   So maybe this is what we can, we can add in here.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.320]   So this seems to be like a system message that they sometimes
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.260]   use to prime chat GPT.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.220]   So let's replace the first part with that.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.260]   Let's put that up here.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.200]   Primer.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.400]   So knowledge cutoff is I think September.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   I don't know if we need to enter this, but September, 2021, and the
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.060]   current date is March, 2023.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.860]   Kind of weird.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.400]   All right.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.900]   So primer, I'm going to put that in there and I'm going to rerun it and see what we get.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.300]   Oops.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.900]   I need to also run this.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.000]   Okay.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.440]   Okay.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.860]   So we get like slightly different output.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.960]   They're slightly different to what we, what we got initially.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.040]   Let's have a quick look at the chat completion and such a limit.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.700]   In the case of max tokens, temperature and max tokens are
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.360]   too many options developers.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.600]   Okay.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.900]   So I think this is the same as the usual inputs that we provide.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:15.040]   So if we go max tokens and say 500, run this again.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.060]   Okay.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.400]   So we actually used not that many.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.140]   Can I try and force it to go longer?
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.800]   Probably not.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.140]   Yeah, but what we probably can do is make it go shorter if we wanted to.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.940]   Okay.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.660]   Let's kind of short and let's do 50.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.760]   Is that shorter?
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.440]   Completion tokens, 39, 55.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.800]   So it is modifying it.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.880]   So you can see the total tokens here, actually.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.280]   So if I put that down to 50, we should not go 50, I think.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.200]   Okay.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.440]   So maybe it's 50 in completion.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.540]   Okay.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.440]   It's cool.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.680]   Right.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.640]   So let's carry on that conversation with the other parts I added in there.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.540]   So I'm going to increase max tokens.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.140]   And what we will do is just copy in the other responses I got.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.840]   So the first answer I got was this, pretty long.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.440]   Let's pull that in.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.640]   So this one's going to be the role will be the assistant.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:27.840]   And the content will be what I just got, but I need to format it a little bit better.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.340]   Actually, I can go.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.640]   Okay.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.940]   It's messy, but it's fine.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.240]   We can do that.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.340]   And then I'm kind of curious.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.940]   What would it do if we fed that in and didn't say anything from the user?
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.640]   Let's see.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.340]   Okay.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.840]   So it's literally just like nothing else is needed, which is cool.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   So it knows.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   Right.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.040]   Next one, I'm going to do user again.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.040]   And my response to that was this.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.340]   Let's see what we get.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.940]   Right.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.440]   So we get a lot more here.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.140]   Let me do response so I can format this a bit nicer.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.040]   So we have choices.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.340]   First one.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.040]   So response choices.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.340]   Then we have message.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.840]   Let me run that.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.040]   Okay, and I'm going to go with content.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.640]   And let's print now.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.040]   It's also in Markdown.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.340]   So we can actually print to Markdown.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.040]   Let me have a quick look at how to do that.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.940]   Naturally, let's ask chat EPT how to do that.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.440]   How do I print Markdown in Jupyter?
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.340]   Jupyter notebook.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.240]   How do I print it with Python?
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.840]   Via Python.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.040]   So.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.440]   All right, cool.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.740]   So we do this.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.640]   Okay, let's try that.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.940]   Perfect.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.340]   So then we come to here and I'm going to display.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.740]   Markdown.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   Let's see what we get.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.540]   Right.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.440]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.040]   So.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.540]   Implement sentence transformer of question answering.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.140]   Okay.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.140]   Yes.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.840]   Yep.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.340]   Okay.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340]   We using Squad 2.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:47.740]   It's better than the one I got before actually, which was like this.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.940]   Which is like NLI meet tokens.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.540]   I wonder if this one is more up to date.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.740]   Curious.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.040]   Okay, cool.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.840]   So let me ask a similar question to this.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   I wonder here if we can go choices.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   Zero message.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.040]   Can we feed this directly back into it?
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   So we have content.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.140]   We have role.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.340]   I think maybe we can.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.240]   All right, so we'll just call it response one.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.340]   Right.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.040]   And what I'm going to do is come to here and I'm going to put response one.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.940]   And then I'll put my next question.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.040]   She has to be role user content.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.540]   I would say do you have any other model was better suited to Q&A?
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.740]   Right.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.240]   Okay.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.740]   See what we get.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.740]   Response.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.240]   Yes, there are a number.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.040]   Okay, so that works.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.140]   You can feed the responses directly back into there using these.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.140]   I can't remember what it says.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.140]   It's like a I shouldn't do that.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.540]   Should do this.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.140]   All right.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.640]   So using this opening, I object cool.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.940]   It's good to know.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.040]   Yes, there are a number of training models and then, you know, see we can
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.640]   we can take that out again.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.340]   What was it?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.840]   It's like choices.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.140]   Zero message.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.940]   I think yeah message and then it was content.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.740]   So then we just display markdown.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.640]   Let's have a look.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.540]   All right, nice.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.840]   So Berkeley way Albert electric you a DPR nice.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.240]   All right.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.040]   So that I think looks pretty cool just as a you know, it's just a very
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.940]   quick intro to chat GP as I mentioned.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.140]   This is the first time I'm using it as well, but it looks very cool.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.140]   It's pretty promising.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.140]   I would like to try this with a few other things see how does the
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.640]   instructions and so on but we'll do that in another video for now.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.340]   I'll leave it there.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.640]   So I hope this has been interesting.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.540]   Thank you very much for watching and I will see you again in the next one.
