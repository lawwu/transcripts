[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Francis Chan joins us one more time from San Francisco
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.140]   as our guest on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.660]   Francis, I want to conclude our episodes with you
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.280]   by asking about parenting in the digital age.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.420]   You have six kids and number seven is on the way.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.700]   As a dad, I find this to be one of the biggest struggles
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.540]   in parenting.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.960]   Have you and Lisa found any keys to setting parameters
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.560]   around the time your kids spend on screens, computers,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220]   devices, and video games in their leisure time?
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.360]   - I'm pretty authoritative in the house.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   So if I say, look, you know, you got 45 minutes a day
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.200]   or an hour a day, you know, that's just the way
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.120]   it's gonna be.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.740]   And they just, they know better than to argue with that.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.520]   But you know, what I will say about the whole computer,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.320]   iPad, movies, video games is a lot of that is our fault.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.000]   We can't blame it on the kids.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400]   We get too busy to parent.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.340]   And so we let the videos keep them occupied.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240]   So, you know, in our home, we do limit their time
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.880]   and we monitor what they watch.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.060]   But so much of it is me.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.360]   Like I need to go out, grab my son and throw the football.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.680]   I need to grab my daughter, take her out to dinner,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960]   go to the beach.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   We need to interact with them.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.600]   The other thing, the reason why this is so important too
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   is I'm meeting more and more kids that don't know
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.960]   how to talk to people.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.360]   They don't know how to interact.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.040]   It's like they don't even wanna look up from their screen.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.200]   And we have to remember, okay, I don't know,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.240]   I don't hear a lot of people talk about this,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.600]   but it hurts the kingdom when we raise
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.560]   socially awkward children.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.760]   We need to raise kids who know how to interact,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.880]   how to have conversations with believers and unbelievers.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.940]   I mean, we're raising soldiers, we're raising missionaries.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.080]   Our job is to get these kids to where they can get
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.680]   into the world and start conversations with people
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.600]   and bring the light of Jesus and the message
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.440]   of the gospel to them.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.900]   And so to me, the big crime in the video game stuff,
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.320]   it's not just that they're attached to the screen,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.240]   but that they're not being useful for the kingdom
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.520]   in conversing with people.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.540]   And it distracts them in their prayer lives
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.280]   and they can't have that singular focus
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.040]   of what it looks like to just be quiet in a room
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.680]   adoring Jesus and enjoying his presence.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.920]   - That is wise counsel to end on.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.080]   Thank you, Francis, and thank you for joining us this week.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.440]   Francis and his wife, Lisa, are the authors
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.100]   of the new book, You and Me Forever,
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.720]   Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   It's definitely worth checking out.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.840]   And we will return tomorrow with Pastor John Piper.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.400]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
