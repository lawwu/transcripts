[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   Last time we looked at joy. Is joy in God a choice that we make, or is joy in God a
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.480]   feeling that just sort of comes and goes? Monday we saw that joy in God is not a choice.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.240]   It's not a choice, but a God-given, spontaneous experience of the beauty, worth, and greatness
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240]   of God.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.640]   That's what you said, Pastor John. Great episode. Love that response. Joy is a gift.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.780]   It's a supernatural gift, a divine awakening to true beauty.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.240]   And that leads to Dan's question today. Dan is in Wheaton, Illinois, and he writes this,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   "Pastor John, I have greatly appreciated your emphasis on joy in the Christian life.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.000]   Indeed, the psalmist tells us to rejoice always. Paul describes himself as sorrowful, yet always
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.560]   rejoicing.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:03.300]   As the Bible commands us to have joy in God, are we in sin to the degree that we lack joy?
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.720]   Or could our lack of joy sometimes be the result of sin, but not a sin in itself?"
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.960]   Whenever we're dealing with the emotional dimension of the Christian life, which is
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.580]   most of it, I think, a simple yes and no answer is seldom adequate. And I was thinking about
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.660]   why this is, and it might be helpful for me to just think out loud with Dan for a minute
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.840]   why endless qualifications sometimes seem to be necessary. One is that words that refer
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   to emotions are so flexible because they carry meaning, but the meaning, the name of an emotion
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.000]   has to correspond with your experience of the emotion because that's the nature of emotions.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.460]   And our experiences of emotions are so different, so the words, when we say them to each other,
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.640]   may not correspond to exactly the same thing. For example, if you've never experienced anger,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.440]   and I use the word anger, it just won't carry meaning for you. Same thing would be pity,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   fear, guilt, lust, pride, greed, joy, admiration, hope, thankfulness, all of those, the hard
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.400]   words, the negative words and the positive words, they all refer to experiences that
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.560]   you may or may not have and that you might have very differently than someone else. So
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.520]   it's hard to give simple answers regarding emotions when people's meanings for the word
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.040]   corresponding to their experiences are so different. And another reason that I feel
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.840]   like I'm always making qualifications when I give answers regarding the emotional life
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:04.720]   of the Christian is that our responses to comments about emotions are so different.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   I might say something in answer to this question, and a sensitive person might feel like I'm
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.000]   pointing out a defect in them that sends them into a tailspin of despondency, while another
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.840]   person might hear the very same word and like water off a duck's back because they're not
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.160]   even touched by comments about their emotions at all. And so a person who tries to answer
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.280]   a question about emotions has to be so discerning if you're in a situation of who's listening,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   and of course I have zero control over that, and I hope that people take to heart this
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.680]   complexity and cut me some slack. So anyway, here's the simple answer, and then endless
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.720]   questions. Since the Bible commands us to rejoice always, I think it is sinful not to.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   There's my simple answer. Jesus commands us to rejoice even in the hardest circumstances.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.500]   Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.160]   against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad. So not just when it's easy, but
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.040]   when it's flat out seemingly impossible, do that. And Peter commands us to rejoice, 1
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.000]   Peter 4.13, rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings. And Paul commands us to rejoice,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.020]   rejoice in the Lord always. And again I say, rejoice, Philippians 4.4. So I take it that
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:42.000]   Christ wants us at all times to rejoice in Him. It's a Christian duty. If we fall short
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.560]   of that duty, it's a sin. Now, there's my simple answer, and here come some qualifications,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.440]   and these are so crucial. The Bible says, for example, weep with those who weep. In
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   other words, compassion, empathy for others will modify at least the way you express your
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.240]   joy, if not the joy itself. There may be joy beneath your tears when you're weeping with
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.600]   those who weep, but you don't sing chipper songs to the grieving saint. And James 4,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.720]   I just saw this for the first time in getting ready for this question, and it was very helpful
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   for me to think about. James 4.9 says, sometimes we sin, be wretched and mourn and weep. Let
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:39.800]   your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Hmm. So what becomes of rejoicing
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.000]   at all times when you let your joy turn into gloom because you've been such a rat towards
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.520]   your employees that you need to repent to God and to them? So there are times, obviously
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:02.840]   from this text, when for the sake of recovered joy, fuller joy, we put away our cheerful
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.800]   demeanor and really experience a broken heart over our sin. Now, my guess is if Paul were
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.880]   having a conversation with James about this, I don't think they would wind up disagreeing.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.160]   I don't think that ultimately contradicts Paul's command to rejoice always because at
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:31.360]   the bottom of our repenting, even in the very moment of our repenting, our repenting is
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   owing to the fact that at the root of our being, we're totally convinced that God is
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:44.080]   all satisfying and we haven't acted like He was. And so there's this seed of joy in God
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.360]   that's even giving rise to my brokenheartedness that I haven't experienced it to the full
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.800]   the way I should. So that's my first qualification. Here's the second one. As soon as I say joylessness
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.480]   is a sin, I realize that the resistance to the command to rejoice may be unbelievably
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.200]   diverse. So here's a person who hears me say, or hears Paul say, "Rejoice always."
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.800]   That person might say, "Who do you think you are telling me to rejoice? Get out of
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.640]   my face." Now that's one kind of disobedience. Here's another one. A person may say, "I
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.880]   want to. I really want to, but I can't feel anything right now but the want to." And
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:33.640]   another person might say, "I do. I do rejoice, but it's so weak." Now, all those three
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.480]   people I think are falling short of rejoice always. And again, I say rejoice, but what
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.360]   a difference between the kinds of falling short. And here's my last one, my last qualification
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.200]   for why the simple answer just can't be left by itself. There are enormous differences
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:01.720]   in personality types. Eeyore, the gloomy, depressed, old gray donkey in Winnie the Pooh
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   is a real personality. And Puddlegum in the Chronicles of Narnia is a real personality
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   type and their experiences of joy are going to look so different from someone else's,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.400]   especially on Sunday morning during worship. And here's the last and most important qualification
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.840]   of all, perhaps. It's not really a qualification, it's an encouragement. 1 Thessalonians 4
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:40.160]   says that the Thessalonians are walking in a way that pleases God. And then he adds,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   "Now, do so more and more." So, they can do better. They can do more. And yet they're
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.880]   pleasing God. In fact, Tony, I noticed in the whole batch of questions you just sent
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:59.040]   me, lots of people struggling with what looks to me like a kind of perfectionism and obsessiveness.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.920]   This text here addresses every one of those questions, I think, because it gives us a
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:12.600]   paradigm to know we can please God while not being as good as we should be. They are pleasing
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.200]   God. "Now, do so more. Please Him more. Go on more. There's more that you can do. There
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.560]   are more things about the way you're living that could become more fully pleasing to God."
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   Which means, and here's the massive encouragement, God has a huge capacity for sorting out the
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   good fruit of our lives from the failings of our lives and finding delight in the good
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:51.280]   while being displeased with the bad and all the while never holding His children in contempt.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.860]   I think a lot of us feel like, "If God's just pleased with me, He's just folding His arms
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.840]   and rolling His eyes and clucking His tongue. It's just fed up with me." That's not true.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.420]   That's not the way He relates to His children. So, back to the beginning, yes, let's rejoice
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:14.960]   in the Lord always. And again, I say rejoice. And even in our shortcomings, there is reason
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   to rejoice.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.480]   Yes. Amen. Always good reasons to rejoice. Thank you, Pastor John, for this emotionally
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   careful and pastoral response to Dan's question. And thanks for joining us today. If you want

[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.120]   of episodes to listen to if you want more on joy.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.480]   Well, speaking of things that we haven't ever really talked about on the podcast, AI
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.200]   is the big news of 2023, artificial intelligence. So, what's Pastor John's first take on chat
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.440]   GPT? What does it mean for learning about divine realities? Can bots guide us into spiritual
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.400]   truth? We're going to find out together next time. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, Pastor John,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.880]   and I will see you on Monday. Have a great weekend.
