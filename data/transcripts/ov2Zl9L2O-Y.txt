[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Grape Nuts Breakfast Time! Crunchy little nuggets bursting with nut sweet flavor.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.320]   Alright here's a question from our good friend Gloria Furman. If it works great,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.200]   if not no problem. Let's hit record and see what happens.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.580]   Hello Pastor John, I think it's great that you love grape nuts so much. When we
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320]   were kids my sisters and I would be made to eat grape nuts on occasion. We never
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.180]   appreciated it so the parents ended up buying those little boxes of cereal for
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.500]   themselves. Now that my cereal preferences have changed and I live in a
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.600]   country where there are no grape nuts, I have occasionally considered buying
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.200]   grape nuts to bring over in my suitcase. The boxes are small but they are dense
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.580]   and heavy. It must be all that bulky fiber. This brings me to my
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.240]   question about how you eat them every day. If you eat them cold and they're
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.160]   kind of gritty and take more time to chew, but if you eat them hot then they
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.840]   have that half soggy half gritty effect. So Pastor John, what is your preference?
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.200]   I'm only willing to answer this question because I know who asked it and she is a
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   woman of substance. You might say like grape nuts, though that probably does not
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.880]   sound like a compliment. The answer is no, soggy is not good and dry crunchy is not
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:31.480]   good. But cold milk crunchy mingled with mini shredded wheats and Great Harvest
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.040]   non crunchy granola, well-timed so that you you don't have squishy minis or warm
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.400]   milk. Now that is the right kind of crunchy. But really there's another
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.240]   secret that makes this breakfast unsurpassed in pleasure and has kept me
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.160]   coming back for about 30 years and gets me out of bed in the morning with hope
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   and beckons me home while I'm jogging and makes me want to go to bed early at
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:17.920]   night so that I morning will come faster with with breakfast. So the secret is so
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.960]   special that I thought I would put it in a limerick and I want to dedicate this
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.800]   limerick to Gloria Fuhrman, woman of substance. Now this is the secret, the
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.840]   secret that makes this breakfast what it is. There once was a man who thought
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   grape nuts were dandy while everyone else considered them sandy. But you don't
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   eat them Sola, for the key is granola cuz molasses and honey make everything
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.440]   candy. That's the secret.
