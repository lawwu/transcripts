[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Today we finish up a little three-part series on free will, started back in
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.640]   episode 307. On Thursday I asked if there's such a thing as free will. No was
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.580]   the answer, and that led to episode number 308 on Friday. So if there's no
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.280]   free will, how are sinners held accountable for not doing what they
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.240]   cannot do? And that leads us finally to today's question. Pastor John, how would
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   you define Christian freedom? What we've said about free will so far is that when
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.760]   it comes to choosing Christ, coming to Christ, nobody has this free will. Nobody
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.520]   has ultimate self-determination that would empower them to overcome their own
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.000]   bondage, their own blindness, provide the decisive influence, and open their eyes
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720]   and see Christ as compelling and come to Him. Nobody can do that for themselves.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.200]   Left to ourselves, we are so deeply in love with darkness, we can't come to the
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.400]   light. We are responsible to come, we said that, because our inability to come is
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.480]   not natural inability, it's a moral inability. We're not chained to a post,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.720]   wanting desperately to come to Christ, but being forbidden to come to Christ.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.400]   Nobody's in that situation, and the reason we can't come is because we love
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.600]   the alternative more. And then Christ breaks in, the Holy Spirit breaks in, and
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.440]   sets us free. And I want to argue that only Christians know true freedom,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.240]   and get at what that true freedom is for just a few minutes. In Romans 6, it
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.200]   says, "Our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin, for the one
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.880]   who's died is set free from sin." So we are a free people, we're not in chains
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   and bondage to our own lusts anymore. Or Romans 6 17, "Thanks be to God that you
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.520]   who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.960]   of teaching." So our freedom is described as a free, joyful, satisfying
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   obedience to God. Jesus said, "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.920]   I want to get inside that. What is that? What is it like to be free
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.400]   indeed? Or Paul said in Galatians 5, "For freedom Christ has set us free." Don't
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.360]   be submitting anymore to bondage. So Christians are the freest of all people.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.840]   Free indeed. What does that mean? And here's my answer. I'll put it in
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.880]   four pieces and then give a picture through the illustration of skydiving.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.520]   To be fully free, free indeed, we must have freedom of desire, freedom of
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   ability, freedom of opportunity, and freedom of no regrets. And skydiving
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   gives a great illustration of what I mean. So what you want now in this
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.280]   illustration is the glorious freedom of skydiving, falling at a hundred and
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.440]   twenty miles an hour, the wind in your face, and then popping your parachute at
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   the last minute and coming safely to the ground, and then doing it over and over
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.160]   again in all kinds of conditions. You want that kind of free, joyful experience.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   So suppose that you're on your way to the airport to go up for your first real
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.600]   jump, and your car hits a pothole, bangs into a telephone pole, and while you're
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.080]   waiting for the truck to come, you miss your appointment and your
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   opportunity passes, so you lose the freedom of opportunity. So you have to
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.520]   have a freedom of opportunity to be truly free, and you just lost it. Or
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.080]   suppose you make it to the airport, but it turns out that you skipped all the
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.440]   classes, and you don't know the first thing about skydiving, and so you don't
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.480]   have any basic abilities to do it, and they're not going to let you do it. And
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.360]   so you don't have the second kind of freedom that you need, namely freedom of
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   ability. You may have freedom of opportunity, you got there, the
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.000]   opportunities before you, you don't have the ability, they're not going to let you
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   jump. Third, suppose you make it to the airport, you go to all the classes, you
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.160]   got all the abilities you need, you take off in the airplane, and as soon as the
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   door opens, you look down, and all your desire vanishes. You are paralyzed with
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.240]   fear at jumping out of this airplane, and you will not jump out. You have lost the
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.280]   freedom of desire. Now you might dutifully jump out, but that's not the
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.680]   way we want to be Christian, right? Everybody knows dutiful jumping is not
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.160]   freedom. It's just another kind of bondage. What you want is, "I love this! I
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.120]   want to do this! I'm out of here!" That's freedom. But you don't have it, you just
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   lost it, you're in fear, and so you don't have the freedom of desire. Now, we're
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.600]   almost done. Suppose you get to the airport, no obstacle, you have the freedom
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   of opportunity, you have all the know-how necessary, you have the freedom of
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.880]   ability, you look out the door at the tiny clusters of silos and barns and
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.800]   farmhouses a few miles down, and you just can't wait to jump. You got all the
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.680]   freedom of desire. This is what you want to do. So you jump, and as you free
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:51.920]   fall, enjoying every second of it, unknown to you, your parachute is defective. It's
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:59.560]   not going to open. No matter what you do, are you free? You feel free. You don't
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.480]   know what's about to happen. This is where most people live. Fully free. Are
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.880]   you free? You're not free. You're dead. You're dead. In 30 seconds, you will be
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.320]   dead. Regrets. In order to be fully free, you got to have a parachute in good
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.220]   working order. You need to be saved. You need to have Jesus Christ, because you
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.840]   are cruising toward destruction, no matter how free you feel in this world
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.800]   without a Savior. When Jesus makes us free, He makes us free at every, every
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.360]   single level. He's given us the freedom of opportunity. He died for us, and the
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.320]   freedom of ability. He gave us the gift of faith, the freedom of desire. He put a
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.560]   new heart in us and wrote His law on it, and caused us to have new desires and
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.800]   new loves. And He gives us the freedom of no regrets in a thousand years. We will
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.720]   we will jump out of this airplane forever with Jesus at our side, and the
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   parachute always open, lands in green pastures. If the Son sets you free, you
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   will be free indeed. And only believers in Jesus have this kind of freedom. Yes,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.440]   that's a great illustration. But to be clear, you're not advocating skydiving as
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.560]   a hobby, right? I don't think you should skydive, because... We've got an entire
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.960]   episode on that. Oh yeah, okay, we don't need to go into that. Yeah, yeah, and that
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.760]   episode was titled "Safety is a Myth." It's episode number 10 in the Ask Pastor
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.440]   John podcast series, way back in the beginning. If you have an iPhone or iPad
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.120]   and the free Ask Pastor John app, you can listen to it by scrolling down the list
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.280]   of episodes to that early episode, episode number 10, "Safety is a Myth." And
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.960]   speaking of fear, what does it mean for a Christian to fear God? Tomorrow we'll
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.680]   tackle that. Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
