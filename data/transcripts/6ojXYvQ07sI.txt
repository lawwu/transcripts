[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.520]   - Hi, me again.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.960]   I have some of the easiest units in the course here
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.200]   because I think these are things
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.240]   that most of us agree upon.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.440]   But I'm gonna talk a little bit
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   about the merits of diversification.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.520]   I think most of us fully understand
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.480]   the value of asset class diversification,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.200]   intra-asset class diversification.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   But I'm gonna dive into that a little bit.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.560]   And I'm also gonna talk about time period diversification,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.600]   which I touched on in my earlier comments
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.520]   about dollar cost averaging.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520]   So Jack Bogle, once again, said it really well
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   about the merits of diversification.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.800]   He said, "Absolutely no one knows
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.020]   "what the stock market is going to do tomorrow,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.540]   "let alone next year,
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.680]   "nor which sector, style or region will lead
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.480]   "and which will lag behind.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.400]   "Given this absolute uncertainty,"
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.840]   and I can just hear it in his booming voice,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.440]   "the most logical strategy
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.060]   "is to invest as broadly as possible."
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.960]   Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz said a version
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960]   of the same thing.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640]   Markowitz, of course, was the path-breaking
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.840]   researcher in modern portfolio theory.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.940]   He said of diversification,
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.060]   "A good portfolio is more than a long list
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.720]   "of good stocks and bonds.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.380]   "It is a balanced whole providing the investor
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.660]   "with protections and opportunities
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.920]   "with respect to a wide range of contingencies."
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   So both Bogle and Markowitz said here
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   that there's so much that we don't know about the future.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   We don't know what the next catastrophe
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.840]   or wonderful thing to come along might be.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.440]   And so the best idea is to invest with humility,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.460]   invest with a sense that we can't predict the future,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.240]   so the best way to go is to build a portfolio
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.860]   given our time horizon that helps set us up
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.660]   for reasonable returns regardless of what happens.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.960]   So the key benefits of diversification
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.680]   I'll just quickly outline.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.860]   One is that it helps ensure that any given point in time,
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.520]   something, anything in your portfolio
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.560]   is performing reasonably well.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.780]   In 2022, unfortunately, that's a really short list
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.960]   of like cash, not great even on an inflation-adjusted basis,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.420]   but at least positive.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.260]   Value stocks have certainly held up better
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.460]   than growth this year.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.260]   Energy stocks, at least until recently,
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.660]   had done reasonably well.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.580]   So there have been a few bright spots,
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.460]   but that's the value of diversification,
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.880]   that you've always got something
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.260]   in your portfolio that works.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.320]   Diversification also guarantees
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.220]   that you won't choose precisely wrong,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.620]   either about the asset class or the specific stock
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.820]   within the equity asset class
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.100]   or the specific time period in which to invest.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.980]   So it helps minimize regret,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.260]   which it turns out is a really valuable thing
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.660]   in terms of helping us stick with our plan.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.500]   And finally, diversification helps reduce
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.580]   the volatility of our portfolios.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.980]   So just having things in our portfolios
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.660]   that behave differently helps bring the risk down.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.180]   It helps bring the standard deviation down.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.220]   Again, that helps us stick with our plans.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.180]   So this is a slide.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.220]   I'll just describe what we're looking at.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.560]   This is something that my colleague,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   Amy Arnott, put together.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.620]   But we did some research where we looked
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.260]   at correlations among asset classes.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.320]   And what you can see, and maybe you can't see,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.200]   maybe it's too tiny, but what you can see
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.180]   is that the more assets that you add,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.100]   that helps reduce the standard deviation
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.660]   or the volatility of the portfolio.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.860]   And that's especially true if you add assets
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.500]   that behave differently.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.260]   So Alan was talking a little bit
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.300]   about the value of doing that.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.520]   So as you see things really taper down there
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.540]   in terms of standard deviation,
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.540]   that's more assets and that's more assets
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.380]   that are uncorrelated.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.800]   Focusing on those two things can help bring down
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.740]   the risk level, the volatility level of a portfolio.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.860]   So there are multiple ways to diversify.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.560]   I hinted at a few of them.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.220]   By asset class, that's the one that most of us think about.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.380]   And Jim Dolly talked about the value
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.460]   of asset class diversification in terms
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.740]   of how our portfolios behave in terms of their returns,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.100]   but it also translates into how it behaves
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.340]   in terms of volatility.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.220]   So asset class diversification,
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.720]   that's usually most of our first stop
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.740]   on the road to diversification.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.980]   Within asset classes, also super important.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.640]   So you want stocks in your portfolio,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.140]   you don't just want a couple of stocks, right?
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.720]   That's something Bogleheads know.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.160]   They know the value of diversifying across multiple stocks,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.340]   which is something that you get
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.160]   with those big broad index fund portfolios.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.640]   Across account types, Jim Dolly talked
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.920]   about tax diversification.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.840]   It's something we don't talk about as much,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.800]   but when you come into retirement
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.860]   and you have multiple pools of assets
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.340]   that you can pull from,
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.280]   that tax diversification really comes in handy.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.520]   And finally, by time period.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.320]   That diversifying your purchases by time period
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.320]   helps ensure that you have a variety of market returns
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.120]   that each dollar is able to benefit from.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.440]   This is just a slide
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.840]   that illustrates asset class diversification.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.560]   I pulled this from some of our research
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.440]   on asset correlations.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.320]   What you can see is that at least until prior to 2022,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   stocks had a nice, not fully negative correlation
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.680]   with U.S. Treasury bonds,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.340]   but in some market environments,
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.300]   indeed a negative correlation.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.880]   We've seen a little bit of a reversal of that this year
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.500]   where stocks and bonds have been moving in sympathy,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.100]   but in many market environments,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.460]   we have seen that nice diversifying ability
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.820]   for those two assets.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.940]   And cash is the other asset class
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.420]   that appears on this screen.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.140]   But remember, you can overdo diversification.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.100]   It's diversification, not, I think Rick Ferry said,
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.100]   maybe someone else did as well,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.420]   it's not de-worsification.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.460]   And this is such an important point
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.700]   that you can overdo diversification.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.980]   In fact, I would say this is one of the main problems
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.220]   I see in the portfolios that I review
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.520]   for these portfolio makeovers that I do.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   People have portfolios that are crazily complicated
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.300]   given their assets.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.460]   They've assumed that more is more.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.160]   And I do wonder if there's a little bit of a wealth effect
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.100]   that people feel if they feel like
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   they've assembled a lot of funds
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.420]   or a lot of investments in a portfolio.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.100]   Even if they just have little bits in them,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.860]   I think it might make them feel wealthier.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.660]   But the problem with overdoing diversification
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.020]   is that it makes it really difficult to see what you've got.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.140]   It makes it difficult to keep track
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.820]   of your portfolio's asset allocation,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.300]   makes it difficult to figure out
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.100]   where you need to make adjustments
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.380]   if your asset allocation gets off track.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.380]   So less is more in terms of moving parts in a portfolio.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.300]   My view is that you can be quite minimalist
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.500]   on a per-account basis,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.820]   and you can even be minimalist across account types.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.920]   In fact, I was recently working with a woman
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.960]   on her portfolio makeover,
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   and she had a really good equity fund in her 401(k),
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.580]   and they wanted to have kind of an ESG portfolio.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.680]   And the net effect,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.340]   because they didn't have a lot of funds,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.100]   was that when I looked at it, I said,
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.380]   I think, forget intra-asset class diversification
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.860]   for this small 401(k) portfolio.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.780]   Just put it all in that ESG index fund
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.020]   and fill out the other asset classes
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.100]   with other parts of your portfolio,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.540]   with your husband's IRA and so forth.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.340]   So this is especially true.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.340]   You can get away with fewer holdings
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.220]   if you have mutual funds and ETFs,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.060]   especially if you have broad market index funds
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.660]   and ETFs in your portfolio.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.300]   The three-fund portfolio, Taylor Laramore isn't here,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.300]   but he'll be joining us tomorrow night at the dinner
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.000]   to say hello to everyone.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.780]   Taylor's three-fund portfolio,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.620]   when you look at it,
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.620]   is just the most elegantly simple creation
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.820]   where you have diversified U.S. equity exposure,
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.020]   so you're picking up more than 4,000 individual equities
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.380]   in a total stock market index fund,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.940]   total international nearly 8,000 individual equities
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.940]   in the bond market, holy cow, 17,000 individual bonds.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.460]   So it's a really well-diversified mix.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.700]   I think that's one reason why many bogleheads use it
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.200]   as the baseline for their portfolios,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.380]   though I would argue people in retirement
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.180]   would probably want to augment these holdings
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.460]   with at least some cash as well for a year like 2022.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.120]   So if they need to take withdrawals,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.160]   they can pull from the cash without having to disrupt
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.780]   declining stock and bond holdings.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   So conclusions when we reflect on diversification
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.260]   and how we want to think about it,
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.900]   I do think that diversification is an expression of humility,
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.460]   an expression of saying there are a lot of things
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.140]   I don't know about how this world could unfold,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.740]   and so I'm going to build a portfolio
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.320]   that will help me fare reasonably well
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.520]   in any number of eventualities.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.420]   So that diversification helps lower volatility,
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.700]   which makes it easier to stick with your plan,
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.620]   and I think you probably hear that idea
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.140]   of sticking with your plan again and again,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.860]   but that's the name of the game.
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.140]   The most well-crafted portfolio isn't worth anything
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.020]   if someone can't stick with it,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.660]   but building in diversification helps lower that volatility.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.860]   It makes it more likely that you'll stick with your plan.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.860]   It's essential across asset classes, across account types,
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.040]   but I think it's especially essential
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.360]   once you move into drawdown mode
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.200]   or as you get close to needing your funds in retirement
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   or whatever goal that you're hoping to fund,
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.160]   it's important that you have assets
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.640]   that you can pull from at those times
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.080]   to ensure that you won't need to pull
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.640]   from depressed asset classes.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.260]   And finally, it is possible to overdo diversification.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.020]   I see this all the time,
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.760]   and the main issue with that diversification
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.520]   is that it can obscure the big picture with your portfolio.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.660]   So less is more.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.740]   As long as you've done the basic blocking and tackling
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.860]   of asset class diversification,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.140]   intra-asset class diversification,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.220]   account diversification, and timing diversification,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.020]   that goes a long way to ensure
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.880]   that you have proper diversification.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.540]   So I'll leave it right there, and we have a break.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.380]   Thanks.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.380]   (audience applauds)
