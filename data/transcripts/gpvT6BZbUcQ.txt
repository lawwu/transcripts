[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.260]   Desree emails to ask, "Pastor John, what advice and biblical encouragement do you
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.660]   have for college graduates who are unemployed or have no certainty of a job
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.000]   in the near future?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.060]   Before I got really practical about strategies that they might be
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.520]   using or not using to make themselves available to employers, I would want to
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.560]   talk at a deeper level first about, do not be anxious about your life. What you
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.340]   should eat, what you should drink, what you should put on. This is Jesus directly
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.160]   talking to this issue it seems to me. Consider the birds of the air, this
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.120]   Matthew 6. They don't sow or reap or gather into barns. Your Heavenly Father
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.600]   feeds them. Consider the lilies. They don't they don't coil or spin. Yet I tell
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.680]   you, Solomon, was not arrayed like one of these. God will take care of you. Seek
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.960]   first the kingdom. So that's my first counsel. Seek first the kingdom of God
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.040]   and his righteousness. Be about kingdom things, which of course going to include
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.840]   looking for a job, but focused on God's glory. And all these things will be added
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.400]   to you. And you know one of the amazing things about that is that it's followed
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.880]   by, don't be anxious about tomorrow. This is verse 34. For tomorrow will be anxious
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.200]   for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Don't make tomorrow's
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.480]   trouble part of today's burden, because God apportions mercy for every day.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.560]   Lamentations 3.22. The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   come to an end. They are new, new every morning. So each day has trouble of its
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   own, Jesus said. And Jeremiah said in Lamentations 3.22, every morning has
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.400]   mercy of its own. And I think Jesus has tailor-made the mercies for the miseries.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.520]   So tomorrow you're going to have mercy for the challenge of that day. Trust him
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.920]   for this. Take promises like, "My God will supply every need of yours according to
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   his riches in glory." Philippians 4.19. Or God is able to make all grace abound to
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you'll abound in
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.840]   every good work. So that's where I'd start. I'd start with these stunning,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.160]   amazing, practical, precious promises of God to take care of us. And here's
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.640]   an illustration from my own life of an application of that. When I was in
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   Germany, finishing up my doctoral work, I'm almost 28 years old now. In fact, I am
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.680]   28 years old. Turned 28 just before I finished. So I've been in school for 28
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.080]   years almost. Home and school. And I haven't had a real job yet, okay? And I've
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.680]   got a wife and I've got a kid now. And I need a job. I just want to be a good
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.320]   husband, father, put bread on the table. And I'm in Germany and nobody knows me in
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.960]   America. How am I going to get a job? And I got a letter from Dan Fuller, my
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   precious doctor, father, friend. Actually, not doctor, father, but just mentor from
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.960]   seminary. And he quoted to me. I've never seen this. And I've used it over and over
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.320]   again for comfort and encouragement. 2 Corinthians 4.1, which says, I'm going to
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:49.680]   read it literally. "Therefore, having this ministry, as we have been shown mercy, we
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   do not lose heart." The "as," he said, "John, you will have a ministry." That is, you
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.360]   will have a job. "By the same mercy that you were saved." That's the way he
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   understands the "as." "Therefore, having this ministry, as we have been shown mercy,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.680]   we don't lose heart." And it gave me tremendous encouragement. And God worked a
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.760]   miracle. He brought one--I wrote 30 letters of inquiry to churches,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.280]   denominations, and schools saying, "I'm ready to do whatever with the Bible you
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.480]   want me to do to advance the cause of the kingdom. Anybody have work for me to do,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:44.120]   please? I need to support my family." And one solitary door opened up. A temporary
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.400]   sabbatical replacement at Bethel College. And I said, "I'll do anything." So I'd
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.200]   never been to Minnesota. I didn't know Bethel existed. And I took that job, and
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.120]   God, in his mercy, made it last for six years until he called me to Bethlehem.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.600]   And so that promise was really, really crucial. And one last
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.120]   encouraging thing about closed doors, because probably the person who asked
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.840]   this question has knocked on a lot of doors, like me. 30 letters, zero
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.960]   response. Just one open door. If you read Acts 16 in particular, and see how
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.120]   Paul was being led, he wanted to minister. He wanted work to do in cities. And so
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.840]   he tried to go into Asia, and it said the Holy Spirit stopped him. Forbade him.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.760]   Wouldn't let him go. And so they went up into Bithynia, and then it says the
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.640]   Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go into Bithynia. So they made another
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.240]   left turn and went over to Troas. And in Troas, Paul had a vision of a man in
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.080]   Macedonia, which is across the water there, over in Europe, so to speak. And the man
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.120]   said, "Come over and help us." And the gospel spread from an Eastern Asia
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.200]   religion, now penetrating into Europe because of two closed doors. So my
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   concluding encouragement is God's closings are his planning. You may be
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:27.000]   puzzled, he's planning. You may feel delayed, God is designing. Trust him. And
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.560]   then of course we could get practical and say, "How many people have you
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.840]   written to?" and all that, but these are the kinds of things I think that
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.800]   really matter. Trust the Lord's timing, and give yourself faithfully to seeking
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.920]   to do his calling. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening. Please email
