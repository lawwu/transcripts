[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.280]   allows you to buy farmland across the country. A few benefits here. Inflation, coming down,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.920]   still a little high though, right? Now, while farmland has no correlations to toxic bonds,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.680]   it does have a positive correlation with inflation going back all the way to the 1960s. A couple
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.960]   other benefits here. Low fees, no use of leverage. I think we've seen, we've learned this year,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.720]   leverage is not very great, right? No leverage use here. If you want to learn more about

[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.320]   Duncan, tough year in the markets. We've been talking about it a lot here, right? Yeah.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.040]   But if you look at the returns now, it's not that bad. John, throw up my chart here. Speak
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080]   for yourself. Well, obviously, I'm saying this after the seventh bear market rally we've
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.480]   had, but these are year-to-date returns. Okay, so value stocks, I'm using the Vanguard value
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   fund here. It's up like more than 1% on the year. It's positive. The Dow, this is all
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.920]   through close on Thursday, okay? So whatever's happened today, not on here. Dow's down just
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.640]   3% on the year. Total returns, small caps, Russell 2000, usually pretty risky. Down less
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.080]   than 9%. International stocks, huge comeback here, even with the dollar in a strong year.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.160]   Down like 12.8%, actually outperforming the S&P now, which is down 13 and change. Growth
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.760]   stocks, the one bad performer, down 27%. So as long as you're not all in on tech stocks
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.840]   or all in on oat milk stocks this year, it's a down year correction, but not a calamity
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.400]   anymore, right? Now, obviously, again, I'm saying this during a bear market rally, so
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.320]   maybe I'm jinxing things here. Merely pointing out where we are in context of where we've
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.840]   been, not all that bad, right? If we get some sort of Santa Claus rally here, I can't imagine
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.880]   if the Dow closes positive for the year. It's going to add to how bizarre this year has
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.280]   been. But really, if you've had a diversified portfolio, it's not been fun, but where we
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.120]   are today, not nearly as bad as where it was. How's that?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.260]   Are you wanting to make a call? No, no, I'm providing context where we are.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.080]   I'm not good at predicting the future. It's hard enough to tell what happened in the past.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.880]   So there's no opinion on where the Dow is going to be at the end of January or anything
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.280]   like that? I'll give you my 2022 Dow point forecast on
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.200]   December 29th. How's that sound? Other than that, I got nothing. Let's do a question.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.320]   Okay. First up, we have a question from Nick who writes, "We own a cash-flowing rental
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   property with a sub-3% mortgage and 28 years remaining. On the August 18th episode of Portfolio
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.960]   Rescue, Barry said real estate more or less returns zero net of inflation. However, does
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.280]   this statement take into account the leverage provided by a mortgage? Return comparisons
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.520]   between stocks and real estate seem to favor stocks, but it's not clear whether these comparisons
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.480]   ever take into account mortgage leverage. Also, how does one factor a mortgage rate
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.320]   that is below current inflation into the calculus? On a 20-year time horizon, would it really
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.520]   theoretically be better to sell the property and invest the proceeds into some combination
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.140]   of stocks and bonds?" We talk a lot here about the types of questions
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.920]   we get, and we've mentioned we get a lot of questions on bonds lately. We've effectively
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.040]   gotten no questions on the stock market for like the past six months. People have stopped
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.880]   asking about the stock market. It's true.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.240]   But there's a lot of questions about the housing market lately too. So unfortunately, the return
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.840]   stream for housing is very difficult to understand. So John, throw up my first chart here. This
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.700]   is from Robert Shiller. Before the late '90s, early 2000s, no one really knew what the long-term
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.720]   returns for housing as a whole were until Robert Shiller put this together. Now, this
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.600]   is real home price index, which means after inflation. He took this back to 1890. I don't
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.760]   know what housing in America looked like in 1890, so I don't know how relevant this all
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.720]   is, but this is what he did. The returns after inflation are probably not as good as most
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.700]   people would assume. So from 1890 to 2022, the latest update, the housing market in the
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.320]   United States is up a total of 120% and change. That's 0.6% per year over the rate of inflation.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.480]   Most of that return, as you can see from this chart, has come in the last three decades.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.520]   So from 1890 to 1989, 100 years, the U.S. housing market appreciated 30% in total, less
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.680]   than 0.3% per year. Again, that's after inflation. So you've got an inflation hedge, not much
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.800]   of a kicker. Then from 1989 to 2022, so the last three decades and change, it's up more
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.920]   than 70% or like 1.6% per year above inflation. Now, some people may look at these numbers
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.220]   and think that's god-awful. I thought it would have been way better than that when you look
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.920]   at the big numbers for housing. I personally think beating the rate of inflation while
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.280]   holding a fixed-rate mortgage and having a roof over your head is not that bad of a deal.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.180]   But it's also important to note that Shiller's data doesn't take into account the actual
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.920]   experience of someone buying and selling a home. Let's say you timed the housing market
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   pretty good, and 10 years ago you bought for $300K in Boise, Idaho. Now you can sell that
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.160]   house for $500K. At the time, you put 10% down, so you put $30,000 down. You sell that
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.640]   house today for $500K, what's your return? Well, some would say it's $200K, right? $200K
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.040]   over $300K, so we're talking like a 67% return. But wait, what about the leverage involved?
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.680]   You only put $30,000 down, right? So is your return more like almost 6X because you turned
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.540]   $30,000 in 200K? Again, not really, because each month you paid a mortgage, you paid insurance,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.480]   you probably did some upkeep, maintenance, landscaping, you probably bought some furniture,
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.640]   maybe hired an interior decorator, made some improvements. So then when you bought the
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.600]   house, you probably paid some closing costs. When you sell the house, you pay some realtor
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.280]   fees and other closing costs. So I'm not sure that anyone actually knows what all the all-in
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   costs are for their house. I don't think anyone really keeps track of them. Maybe a few spreadsheet
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.200]   warriors do. The other thing is, you have to live somewhere, so wait a minute, why don't
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.000]   we net out what my rent payments would be, what my mortgage costs would be, and I just
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.640]   guess no one on the planet knows what their all-in return is, because it's not like a
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.880]   stock or a mutual fund where you just buy it and you know the expense ratio every year,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.960]   and you can just calculate it easily, right? Plus, housing is a form of consumption. That's
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.840]   why it's so difficult to compare housing to other financial markets like stocks and bonds.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.480]   Now this question is more about a rental property, right? So maybe that's a little easier to
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.960]   figure out, but I think there's still a lot of unknowns. And I think a lot of this comes
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.640]   down to your, we talked about this in recent weeks, your talents for complexity. Now, rental
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.300]   houses can offer a decent yield on your investment, right? You have the ability to raise rents
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.120]   over time, so that's an inflation hedge. Hopefully the price is gonna go up a little bit, even
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.920]   if it's like Shiller long-term data says, a couple percent over a little bit, a smidge
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.240]   over the inflation rate. You're building equity through accumulation and then paying down
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.840]   your principal. We've talked about the big risks before, concentration, illiquidity,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.940]   plus there's a headache risk involved if something breaks, or you can't find a tenant and can't
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.720]   fill it, the pipes burst, that sort of thing. I guess you could pay a management company
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.080]   to handle a lot of that heavy lifting for you, but that eats into your returns as well.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.920]   I guess it really depends on the trade-offs you want to have. Your index funds are never
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.600]   gonna call you in the middle of the night and say, "Hey, my AC broke on the unit. Come
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.040]   fix it for me." I do think, though, there are benefits to owning real estate. Like,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.640]   you don't have five days a week where you have a bunch of crazy people trading your
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.960]   house day in and day out and telling you the price. "The price is down 1% today." "No,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   it's up 1%." "No, it doesn't move a lot." So, I think it's a lot easier to think and
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.120]   act for the long-term real estate, even if it does have lower returns than the stock
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.800]   market. But I think for a lot of people, there's just so much more idiosyncratic risk because
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.480]   of your local economy and all these things, and you have not only the macro stuff to deal
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.760]   with inflation and interest rates and economic growth, but you also have the local economy
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.700]   and the location and tenants and all this stuff. So, I wouldn't try to talk someone
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.920]   out of it, but I think making the comparison between stocks and real estate is gonna be
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.480]   very difficult to do, unless you're really tracking this stuff. And so, I think a lot
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.520]   of it comes down to how much you're willing to put in to being an actual landlord.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   Also, this might be a first-world problem, but I would think that there are things that
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.440]   you wouldn't expect to encounter that you might encounter. Like, if you have a really
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.360]   cool vacation home, suddenly you have a bunch of friends and family wanting to stay there.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.280]   You were planning to rent it out and make money off of it on Airbnb or something. Next
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.880]   thing you know, you have a bunch of weeks of the year taken up by friends and family,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   right?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.540]   Yeah, those leeches. What are you doing? You're not using my summer vacation home. Come on.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.720]   You give them a 20% discount, right?
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.640]   There you go. Yeah, that's true. So, yeah. So, I know people who ... People like the
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   tangible nature of owning a home and owning rental properties, and I understand that.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.280]   And some people just don't trust the stock market. I don't think there's any one way
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.900]   to succeed. I think you just have to understand the trade-offs when you get involved in something
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   like this.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Yeah. That makes sense.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   Let's do another one.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:02.180]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Matt, who starts off with, "Love the podcast. Keep
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.740]   up the great work." Thank you, Matt.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.740]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.580]   Also, this is a good ... This is an opportune time to mention, if you use Spotify, they're
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:16.340]   doing the yearly Spotify year-in-review type thing, where it shows your top-listened podcasts
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.140]   over the year. If we're one of them, or the Compound Friends, Animal Spirits, whatever,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.140]   share that with us.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.900]   I'm not sharing it. They have the same feature on Apple now. They just stole it from Spotify,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.060]   and it did all the music I've played. It was all Disney songs and zombie songs for my kids.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.660]   It was ... It just totally screws up everything, because all my kids want to listen to. They
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   listen to more music.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.860]   You should still share it. I'd like to see that.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.460]   Not great. Zombies 3 soundtrack from Disney.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.260]   Okay. So, Matt writes, "Recently, I've been hearing that the wealth effect is more tied
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.100]   to people's homes than stocks. This argument seems to be related to the fact that a large
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.700]   percentage of stock ownership is in the hands of so few. However, it seems like average
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.620]   401(k) balances versus average home equity are fairly close. I would imagine that most
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.800]   people that own a home would also likely have a 401(k). I would also tend to think that
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.020]   home equity and 401(k) balances would trend together, as both are likely to increase over
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.940]   a lifetime. But to be honest, neither of these things affects how I personally spend. That
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.500]   part has much more to do with how secure I feel in my job and my expectations about raises
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.400]   and bonuses. So, is the wealth effect just nonsense? Maybe it's just correlated because
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.460]   when housing and stocks are going up, pay and bonuses are likely going up, too."
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.060]   I like this question mostly because I kind of agree with the premise. So, the wealth
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.860]   effect, for those who don't know, is just, if your stock portfolio is going up, or your
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.100]   house price is going up, maybe you feel better about yourself, and you spend more money.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.380]   And there's this idea where that's just a self-fulfilling thing. And then, when those
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.700]   prices go down, maybe you don't spend as much money.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.340]   I do disagree with the idea that the stock market and the housing market are similar
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.240]   for most people. So, John, throw up the first table here on net worth by different levels
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.660]   of wealth. A lot going on here. Allow me to explain. The top 10% in this country, in terms
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:04.140]   of wealth, holds 70% of the net worth. The bottom 90% accounts for 75% of the debt in
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.260]   this country, which doesn't sound like a great trade-off there. The reason for this is because
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.340]   the top 10% owns most of the financial assets, while the bottom 90% has more of their net
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.220]   worth tied up in things like real estate. So, John, go to the next table here. This
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.620]   is just looking at real estate and stocks. So, the top 10%, in terms of wealth, owns
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.780]   almost 90% of the stocks. The bottom 90% owns more than 55% of the real estate. It's interesting,
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.380]   when you look at the top 1%, they own almost more than 50% of the stocks, and less than
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:37.260]   14% of the real estate. So, it's not completely balanced, but the lower and middle classes
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.460]   have most of their wealth tied up in their home, while the wealthy class has the majority
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.100]   of their wealth tied up in stocks and bonds, on a relative basis. So, if you think about
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.060]   only, again, the top 10% own 90% of the stocks. I think it's something like 50% of people
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.220]   in the households in the U.S. own stock in any form. The homeownership rate is 65%. So,
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.700]   I would argue the housing market has a far greater impact on wealth than households than
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.180]   the stock market does. If you think about the 2008 disaster, that's why it was so bad,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.620]   because that's why the middle class got hit so bad, because the housing market got hit
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.380]   so bad. I do agree that the wealth effect is probably overstated. It's kind of like
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:15.620]   a correlation is not equalization thing. When the stock market is rising, the margin debt
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.940]   is up, too. And people think, "Oh, the margin debt is so large, people are overleveraged,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.420]   that has to fall, and that's going to wreck the stock market." But actually, it's like
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.860]   a concurrent thing. The margin debt is up because the stock market is up. And then,
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.940]   when the stock market goes down, margin debt goes down. I think the same thing is true
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.700]   of the wealth effect. So, let's say in the next year, the housing market goes down 10%,
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.820]   and so does the stock market. But you can still pay your mortgage, you still have a
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.100]   job, you're still saving money. Does that 10% decline in financial assets really change
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.460]   your life in any meaningful way? I guess maybe you can't take as much out of your home equity
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.620]   line of credit to potentially do some upgrades on your house or whatever. Maybe you could
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.060]   make the case that people save less when their investments are doing well, because they assume
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.980]   the returns of doing the heavy lifting for them. I think it's probably more about confidence
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.280]   than anything. When the stock market and the housing market are doing well, the economy
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.340]   is doing well, too. So, people are probably making money and feel more confident. And
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.780]   when those things are doing poorly, the economy is doing poorly. It's not a perfect one-to-one,
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.700]   but I think this year is a perfect example. The stock market has been in a bear market
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.620]   pretty much since the beginning of the year. The stock market peaked on January 3rd. People
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.240]   are still spending money like crazy. People are still traveling, they're still spending
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.140]   tons of money on stuff. Black Friday was a boom again this year. And I don't think those
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.700]   401(k) balances are really stopping people from spending money. So, I think it probably
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.140]   does have more to do with employment picture and raises and bonuses and all that stuff.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.440]   And a lot of times when the economy is doing well, the stock market isn't. It doesn't always
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.260]   work like that, obviously, this year. But I think as long as people have jobs, they're
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.460]   going to be willing to spend some money.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.520]   Yeah, it seems like it. New York is certainly booming right now. I look out over Bryant
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.260]   Park and it's full.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.460]   Right. Do they care that their growth stocks are down 27% this year? Probably not, right?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.420]   They're still going to pay for those ice skate rentals?
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.420]   Yeah, seems like it.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.620]   Pay for those $13 beers in New York?
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.620]   Sure.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.620]   Do another one.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.260]   Okay, up next, deja vu, we have a question from another Matt. So, Matt writes, "Why would
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.420]   the 10-year T-bond pay out a lower rate than the 2-year? Or would the 30-year pay less
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.620]   than the 10-year?" I realize this is a bit of a Google-it question, but I can't get a
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.500]   straight layman's term answer on this. I've always associated longer term with getting
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.520]   paid more yield, as it means I potentially lose access to my money for a longer period
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.900]   of time and should be paid accordingly. This is a good question. We have a lot of people
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.260]   who wonder about this kind of thing. This is the inverted yield curve, right?
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260]   Yes, it is a perfectly reasonable question to ask from a textbook perspective. All else
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.300]   equal, you would assume that you would get a higher yield from a bond that takes longer
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.180]   to pay off versus one that takes shorter, because so many more things can happen in
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.500]   terms of interest rate changes and inflation and economic growth over 30 years than, say,
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.800]   30 months. So, in a normal economic environment, if there is such a thing, you would expect
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.020]   30-year Treasuries to yield more than 20-year, which you would expect to yield more than
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.180]   10 and 5, and all down the line. That just seems like common sense. But, at times, we
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.620]   find ourselves in the current situation, where short-term yields are higher than long-term
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:07.020]   yields. So, John, throw up the chart of Treasury yields here. You can see, three 6-, 12-month
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.820]   Treasury bonds, or bills, are now paying more than 5-, 10-, and 30-year bonds, which seems
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.380]   to make no sense. Those ones are way more volatile, way more risky, yet you're earning
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.180]   a higher yield at the shorter end of the curve, and by a pretty decent margin. So, why does
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.540]   this happen? Bond yield spreads, the difference between certain maturities of bonds, are typically
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.180]   used to gauge the health of the economy. So, wider spreads, when longer-term yields are
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.300]   higher than shorter-term yields, lead to an upward-sloping yield curve, which would indicate
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.060]   healthy economic prospects. So, you'd think higher economic growth in the future, higher
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.700]   inflation. Narrower spreads, which is a flatter, even an inverted yield curve, they call it
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:49.460]   inverted, when it's lower, when the shorter-term are higher than the longer-term. We really
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:56.820]   missed our opportunity to use a Top Gun picture here, being inverted. That's most likely a
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.860]   sign that growth is going to be slower in the future, and inflation. So, the bond market
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.420]   is predicting that inflation is going to be lower in the future, and maybe growth is going
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.940]   to be lower. And typically, they think this means that we're heading toward a recession.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.580]   So, John, throw up the next chart. This is the 10-year and the 2-year. This is just the
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.300]   10-year minus the 2-year. You can see, as long as it's below that black line, that means
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.260]   it's inverted. And you can see, I circled the parts on the chart here, the gray bars
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.980]   after it are recessions. So, you can see, when this happens, historically, over the
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.880]   last 40 years or so, every time the bond market gets inverted, when shorter-term yields are
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.620]   higher than longer-term yields, then we've gone into a recession. And, John, fill the
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.540]   next little table up here. I looked at the last few times this has happened. The start
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.980]   of the yield curve to the start of the recession. You can see it ranges anywhere from 10 to
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.660]   24 months, and the average is about 17 months. So, if we believe the bond market, what it's
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.860]   really saying is growth and inflation are probably coming down in the future. Does the
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.780]   bond market always get this right? Historically, with the yield curve, yes. Does that mean
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.180]   it's always going to happen in the future? I don't know. Even if the yield curve does
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.820]   predict a recession, we can't predict when it's going to happen, how the stock market
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.300]   will react to it, the magnitude of the recession or the stock market's impact, and what the
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.980]   Fed will do in the meantime. The Fed piece is probably the most important part here right
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.700]   now. The Fed is effectively inverting the yield curve on purpose. They're raising short-term
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.900]   rates, and the long end of the bond curve is saying, "We don't care. We don't think
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:19.460]   inflation is going to be high in the future. We're stuck here below 4%." So, I really don't
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.100]   know if there's any predictive power in this anymore, but that's why short-term rates are
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.100]   higher than long-term rates right now. The Fed is raising short-term rates, and the bond
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.620]   market that is not controlled by the Fed is saying, "That's fine. Go ahead. We're going
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.620]   to stay where we are." So, I don't know who's going to blink first. It's Jerome Powell versus
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.940]   the bond market.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:42.380]   O'Reilly: Yeah, who knows? Do you think that COVID completely ruined the yield curve as
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.620]   an indicator? I know we had Campbell Harvey on to talk about that a long time ago.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.260]   Lewis: Well, if you think the yield curve can predict a pandemic, it's pretty darn smart
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.580]   then. I'm just not going to get in the way anymore, then, if it can do that. But it did
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.140]   invert, and then we had a recession. So, I think that's, again, a coincident indicator.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:04.540]   It was kind of lucky. And if the Fed keeps raising rates and the long end of the curve
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.260]   keeps going down because it thinks inflation is going to be coming lower, it's just going
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.640]   to get more and more inverted. And we're closing in. It's the most inverted it's been since
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.460]   the 1980s, when you had really fast-moving rates by the Fed. So, we shall see. Hasn't
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.460]   been wrong yet.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460]   O'Reilly: Ominous.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.280]   Lewis: Fun times. Let's do another one.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.800]   Up next, we have a question from Brennan. "Does tax-loss harvesting have to be done
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.880]   in the same year? For example, I sold stock earlier in the year for a loss. Do I have
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.640]   to sell my winners in this calendar year in order to offset the capital gains?"
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.600]   O'Reilly: Alright, a question that's beyond my level of expertise. Let's bring in the
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.360]   tax man, Bill Sweet, yet again to get to the bottom of this.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   Hi, Bill.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   Sweet: Gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you and the listeners and viewers to my kitchen,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.800]   where the coffee is hot and the beer is cold. Welcome.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.480]   O'Reilly: I notice you have coffee and not a beer, though.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.440]   Sweet: Yeah, well, it's not noon yet somewhere, and I was thirsty, so I went to town.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.840]   O'Reilly: Alright, Bill, there are some weird tax timing issues. Like, you always tell me,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.800]   "Hey, Ben, you have until April to put money into your SEP IRA." So, there are some weird
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.080]   things where you can go past the end of the calendar year. Does tax-loss harvesting look
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   like this, or not?
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   Sweet: Yeah, well, I'm going to correct you there. You've got until October, if you file
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   an extension.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   O'Reilly: October? Oh, okay.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   Sweet: Let's get really crazy.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   O'Reilly: Alright. Does tax-loss harvesting work in the same way, or not?
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.880]   Sweet: So, it does. So, great question. And in order to get your tax losses in for the
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.640]   year, so let's start here, for Brennan. You do need to execute by December 31st of 2022,
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.620]   so that's the most important thing. And this year, Ben, that happens to fall on a Saturday,
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.040]   so I might recommend doing that at least a day before, getting in during the workday
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.360]   on the 30th. And I think the market's closed after noon on the Friday before New Year's.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.080]   Correct me if I'm wrong. Ben, do you know that off the top of your head? I do not.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.560]   Sweet: I've got nothing. But by that time, I'm totally checked out, Bill, for the last
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   50 years. I'm sorry.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.100]   O'Reilly: We've moved on. So, and just a point of emphasis, too, the tax law generally
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.480]   recognizes the trade date, not the settlement date, so that's important, the legal date
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.200]   that it falls out. But Ben, I've got two neat things to point out for Brennan. Number one
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.040]   is everything that's out for the calendar year. So, if you do a trade on January 2nd,
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.600]   you do a trade on December 29th, all that just gets mushed into a giant bowl of spaghetti
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.160]   when you're trying to calculate, "What is my capital gains tax?" So, that's extremely
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.980]   important to understand, that it's really the full year that matters, and then each
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.240]   year the calendar flips over, and we move on. You cannot file on a fiscal year basis
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.840]   from June to July as a U.S. taxpayer. They're like, "Nope, January 1, December 31." So,
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.240]   that's the neat thing. And you only pay tax on the net. And so, you can generate short-term
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.800]   capital losses, offset long-term capital gains, and everywhere in between, you add it all
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.160]   up and what's left, that's what you pay tax on in April. So, that's the first key point
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.240]   to understand. What are your questions about that, gentlemen?
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.420]   That makes sense to me. I see someone in the chat here says they're a farmer because they've
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:51.940]   been harvesting losses all year long, and I think this is definitely the year for it.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.440]   The problem for a lot of people this year is, "Do we have gains to offset those losses
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   and actually use them?"
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.980]   Yeah. And so, that brings us to the second part of Brent in question, is he's like, "Well,
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.160]   look, if I've got my losses, do I need to generate gains in a year or do these go away?"
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:11.660]   The answer is no. You can deduct up to $3,000, only $3,000 of capital gains, excuse me, capital
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.020]   losses against your ordinary income. And that's a neat thing. It's been set in the tax code
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:22.400]   since 1978. Fun fact with inflation, that would be indexed to $13,700 today, an increase
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   of 360%.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.380]   You know what we should index it to? Bear markets. If there's a bear market, you can
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.380]   take more losses.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.500]   That would be great. That'd be great. But ultimately, any amounts that you don't use
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   against gains, and then any amounts that you do not apply above $3,000 against your ordinary
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.580]   income, those carry forward to the next year. And so, Brennan, hypothetically, if he realizes
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:48.060]   $9,000 of net capital losses, he uses $3K against his ordinary income. Now, $6,000 starts
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.020]   on his balance sheet on January 1, 2023, and then he can recognize the gain next year and
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.740]   still be offset against the loss. And that's a neat thing. And I would recommend thinking
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.220]   about arbitrage there, because ultimately, if my ordinary income rate is 24%, if it's
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:09.580]   32%, that $3,000 generates some arbitrage opportunities versus the 15% capital gains
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   rate.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.020]   So I think in a year like this, Ben, one way to make lemonade out of lemons or make regular
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:20.420]   coffee out of decaf coffee, throw some caffeine in it, is try to hit that $3,000 loss limit,
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.300]   push your gains off until January. I think that's a great thing to think about.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.620]   That makes sense. All right.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   I love a good arbitrage.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.220]   Yeah, it's good. It's good stuff.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.220]   Let's do another one.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   Let's do it.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.940]   All right. Up next, we have a question from Rob. I just retired this year, congrats, at
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.100]   age 55, and I'm looking into various--
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.540]   That's our not-to-brag-of-the-day, to retire early.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.540]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.540]   Good for him.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.460]   Yeah, at 55, that's good. And I'm looking into various tax planning strategies. One
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.740]   plan would be to withdraw money from my 401(k) and then deposit the max allowed into my HSA.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.560]   I qualify for the rule of 55, so there would be no 10% penalty. No idea what they're talking
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.180]   about. Wouldn't this be tax-neutral in the current year? 401(k) withdrawal is taxable,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.500]   but HSA deposits are deductible. This seems like a no-brainer, or am I thinking about
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.020]   this wrong? I would also like some clarification on paying taxes on Roth conversions. If I
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.340]   convert some money from my 401(k) to my Roth in January, would the tax for that amount
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.580]   be due in the first quarter of the year, or could I spread out the payments throughout
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.580]   the year?
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.260]   All right, Bill, you're going to have to send this guy a bill after this one, I think.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.440]   All right. So this is, I mean, there's no cross-currents in terms of going from one
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   retirement account to another, as long as, I mean, the money is kind of just switching
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.960]   hands. That's doable? He can go from the 401(k) to the HSA?
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.840]   I mean, yes. I mean, not directly, so that's the key. But, Rob, you've got a lot going
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.320]   on, my man. I might stop what I'm doing, pick up the phone, dial 1-800-CFP. And we can't
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.760]   give you specific advice. This is our business, after all. It's helping people like Rob navigate
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:56.120]   these things. But we can riff on general topics. So let's start there, Ben. Yes, an HSA, $8,300
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:02.720]   contribution for a family HSA, that can directly offset up to $8,300 of a 401(k) distribution.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.840]   So if you time that, both in the same tax year, those net out to zero and you're good
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.760]   to go. And the HSA, we don't need to go into, but ultimately, if you're using that for medical
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.520]   expenses, you don't ever pay tax on that amount. So that, I think, is a neat thing. I think
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.280]   it's a great place to start, Rob.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.160]   And the rule of 55 thing is just, he's talking about not having any penalty for taking money
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   out of a retirement.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.320]   Yeah, that's it. That's it. So 59 and a half. Why a half-year? I have no idea. Just some
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.680]   genius in the tax code back in the pre-war days.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.840]   That is bizarre. It seems like a five-year-old made this, because my five-year-olds celebrate
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.880]   their half-birthdays. They're always like, "When's my half-birthday?" They think it's
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.180]   a real thing. It seems like someone in the tax code did this, too.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.000]   We want our politicians to focus on kitchen table issues, and maybe that one literally
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.880]   came from the kitchen table. But it does really complicate things, because if my birthday
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:51.480]   is July 2nd, I have to wait until the next year in order to get to that 59 and a half?
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.680]   It's insane. Can we just get to 50? Call your congressperson.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.460]   But ultimately, what the rule of 55 allows you to do is access distributions before age
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:07.120]   59 and a half. And the 55 just refers to, there's a four-year window where that's possible.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.880]   And basically, you do have to actually be retired. There's a couple of other ways that
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.320]   it goes. But ultimately, it ends up being a relatively small amount of money. And so,
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.840]   I wouldn't necessarily rely on that to save the bacon if you're planning on retiring at
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   56 or later.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.100]   All right. And let's also tell Rob, if you're getting this much into the minutiae, you probably
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.040]   might need to talk to someone, a CPA or an advisor.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.120]   Yeah. We're doing this for fun here. But yeah, there are spreadsheets involved. But Rob's
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:38.160]   second question was relating to conversions, right? And so, the second part of his question
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.600]   was if I do a Roth conversion in January, is that spread evenly throughout the year?
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.320]   And let's go back to the capital gains conversation. It's the same thing that a conversion in January
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.400]   is going to be taxed the same for tax purposes. I'm going to get to the distinction in a second.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.480]   All the way out to December, it really doesn't matter. Your tax is calculated on your total
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.160]   income for the year. So, where that happens in the year is not relevant as long as it
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.200]   happens Jan 1 to December 31.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.520]   However, what Rob might be getting at is there are estimated taxes due potentially on when
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.880]   you take the distribution. And if you're timing something in January, that falls in Q1. Q1
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.240]   estimated tax is due in April. And that does need to be spread more or less evenly throughout
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.360]   the year. There are two rules of thumb. One is you need to have at least 90% of your current
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.320]   year income, or there's a safe harbor 110% of the prior year income. So, if you're doing
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.960]   a conversion in January, I think it would make sense to withhold at least a quarter
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.700]   of that amount by April 15 to avoid the estimated tax penalty.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.360]   At least taxes aren't complicated, right?
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.060]   It's almost like people get paid to do this. So, fun fact for you both gentlemen. The federal
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.820]   budget for estimated tax purposes, the quarters go January through March, April to May, put
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:53.860]   a pin in that, June, July, August, and then the Q4 is September, October, November, December.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:59.100]   Ben, why is this the case? Why did this kitchen table nonsense happen? Why do I have a quarter
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.100]   involving Q4?
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.660]   I always forget when I'm supposed to make my payments. I have to remind myself.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:07.500]   Yeah, it's June 15th. The reason, and I'll give you a hint, the federal budget turns
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:14.140]   over on September 1, or October 1. So, they do this thing where they shorten the quarters.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.660]   They have this extra long quarter at the end. In just one year, they needed to make some
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.860]   budget and they were like, "You know what? Let's have a two-month quarter so we can get
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.860]   the payments in time."
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.820]   Well, I know this. My brother works for the government. He says-
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.740]   Oh, so it's his fault.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.780]   Well, no. When they get to September, he says, "Listen, we have this much left in our budget
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.980]   and we have to spend it. Otherwise, we don't get our new budget."
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.860]   Yeah, yeah. In the Army, that was it. That, I think, is actually the explanation for a
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.900]   lot of efficiency. It's one thing when I counsel people on business types. One of the beauties
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.300]   of the pass-through LLC structure, for example, Ridd-Holtz Wealth Management LLC, the net
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.640]   profits are the net profits, right? So, there's no incentive to spend the money because it's
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.060]   your money. So, I think that's a great way to run a business.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   All right, we got one more.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.020]   Okay. Last but not least, we have a question from Hadley. "My wife is taking," and this
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.580]   is a two-parter, so stick with us. "My wife is taking a year off from work to care for
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   our child, which means our income is way down. We are both 45 and I have about $300,000 in
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   long-term capital gains and a salary of $65,000. What are some strategies I can use to try
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.300]   to minimize our current year taxes while also reaching the goal of harvesting as much capital
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.740]   gains at the 0% rate as possible? I've increased my contributions to my employee-sponsored
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:30.820]   401(k) with no match to lower my taxable income as much as I can, given our expenses. I plan
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:36.180]   to use some of the gains to max out our Roths this year, $3,000 left, as well as next year."
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:42.260]   Page two. "Is there some rough formula for figuring this out? What I have landed on is
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:50.900]   $83,349 max for 0% capital gains plus the standard deduction of $25,900, giving me a
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:29:01.220]   max AGI of $109,249 for the 0% capital gains rate and 12% tax bracket. Is that correct,
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.860]   or am I just some idiot reading too much on the internet who needs to talk to his CPA?"
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.340]   These are some next-level questions from listeners this week.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.300]   I know, yeah, this is a lot. "As an aside, if I figure this out, would it potentially be better
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:19.700]   for my wife to stay out of work for the rest of the year due to the one-off tax benefits,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:25.460]   or maybe take a job the last month or two, which would bump up our income $4,000 to $5,000 a month?"
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.100]   Yeah, this one's a lot. Getting out of the minutiae here, the whole idea is
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:36.180]   we have these gains. They'd never even mentioned how they got the $300,000 gains, so kudos to that.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.260]   That's enough to brag, yeah. Yeah, we've got some tax ninjas that work here, obviously, but
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:46.180]   they want to lower their taxable income. So how do they do this? Because the idea would be lowering
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.340]   the taxable income means paying less on those capital gains. Is that the idea? I think so,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.900]   but Hadley's on to ... The first Hadley I've run into in my career, by the way. A strong name,
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.420]   I enjoy it. Is that like a Scottish name? I wish I'd had it for my son. Maybe, yeah.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.980]   That sounds like a Highlands name or something. Yeah, that's some good stuff. What he's getting
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.900]   at is how there is a neat thing that happens if you happen to be in the 12% tax bracket,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:14.660]   and Hadley mentions the dollar amount where that happens, about $89,000 of taxable income,
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.300]   and then you can add a standard deduction on top of that. The capital gains rate at that
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:25.860]   income range is zero. It's 0%. So we, as a short form, say 15%, the capital gains rate,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.460]   if you're not making a whole poop ton of money, is actually 0%, and that's a great thing. I think
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.860]   that's an awesome thing for you as taxpayers. And what Hadley appears to be getting at is how do I
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:42.100]   maximize the benefit of that 0% tax rate? I was not prepared to do a chart, so I just wrote one
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   down, and it's not going to work at all, but what I want to illustrate here is the effect of
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.660]   stacking. Did you draw that on a napkin, Bill? I did. This is a kitchen table conversation we're
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.300]   having here, guys. But ultimately, it's the effect of stacking. So let's start with a 401(k). Hadley
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.540]   mentioned he made $65,000 pre-tax. Let's say, hypothetically, he gets close to the 401(k) target.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.340]   Duncan is going to lose it on the production value. This is not professional. I think it's
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:10.340]   working, though. And so his net income after 401(k) is about 45k, right? So that's stack one.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.620]   Let's think about that. You're taxed on your taxable income. 401(k) is the deduction, guys,
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:20.980]   right? So that's super cool. Now let's flip this puppy over. I calculated that Hadley can realize
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.820]   about $64,000 of capital gains tax tax-free. That sounds pretty awesome, right? So if you're
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:33.140]   sitting on 300k, a 0% tax rate is pretty awesome. How does the math work? First, you have to stack
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:38.660]   that on top of your ordinary income. We just calculated that. Then we get to deduct a standard
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:46.020]   deduction of $25,900. And then the tax rate gets calculated as this. The $19,000 that's left after
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:52.100]   the standard deduction, that gets taxed at 10%. That's pretty awesome. And because Hadley's below
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:32:00.580]   the $83,349 limit for the 12% tax bracket, the capital gains is all taxed at zero. If he crosses
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:06.100]   this threshold, the amount above it, $1,000, is going to get taxed at 15%. So maybe you want to
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:12.740]   leave some wiggle room there. But ultimately, stay below this line, and you pay $1,900 of tax
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:19.300]   on $129,000 of income. That calculates to 1.5%. That's what I think he's getting at. And that's
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.340]   more or less the way it works. The key here-- Hadley's going to write us in and say, "Bill,
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.180]   can you mail that to me, please?" Stacking. I guess he can always pause it. This is it.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.180]   So again, we do need to send invoices. This is next level stuff that we're talking about here,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:35.300]   guys. Good work. But impressive for, again, that level of gains.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:40.580]   And good for you for asking the question, Hadley. Yeah. Can I hit on something at the end? Hadley's
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.180]   like, "Hey, my wife's thinking about going back to work." Yeah, I didn't get that part.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.060]   That is a family decision. Ultimately, yes. This would screw up all my beautiful tax math,
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.940]   right? But the tax rate is-- these questions drive me insane. Because your tax rate is never
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.860]   100%. You are always better off going out and earning the money. And so even if it's $1,000,
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:05.300]   $5,000, whatever it is, go out, earn that cheese, bring that bread home, sit down,
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.020]   upgrade your coffee, put it into a Rotary-- Right. That's saying, "Should I not earn $5,000
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.700]   because I have to pay $1,000 of it in taxes or whatever it is?" Exactly. So your tax rate is
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.900]   never going to be 100%. And ultimately, I think economically, everybody's better off when folks
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.580]   are out there in the workforce making stuff happen, making things move and shake. But taking
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.140]   care of a child is no small feat. I think we all know that. So I would make a family decision and
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.860]   ultimately bend the tax math around what you guys want to do with your life. I think our new rule
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.700]   is going to be anytime we have more than four numbers in a question, Bill's sending you an
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.180]   invoice. Sorry. He's a CFO. He has that right. I'm going to scan this puppy. Yeah. And you will
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.860]   hear from QuickBooks Online. Let's do it. All right. We have a few more shows this year. What
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   do we have? Three more shows, Duncan? So we're out of here? Yeah. All right. Remember, if you're
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:54.020]   listening to the podcast, leave us a review. Thanks to Bill again for coming on. Leave us
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:34:00.100]   some comments in YouTube here. Compound merch is idontshop.com. Keep those questions and comments
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.500]   coming. Ask the Compound Show at gmail.com. Maybe ask us a question about the stock market,
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.740]   right? We're sick of questions about bonds. Yeah. I never get sick of questions about tax.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:25.780]   Tax ninjas, unite. Let's do this. See you next time. Thanks, everyone.
