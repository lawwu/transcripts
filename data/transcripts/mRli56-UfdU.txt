[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.160]   - This is Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.980]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.100]   We get questions every week from people on YouTube,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.220]   email, Twitter, wherever.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.060]   Always good ones.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.880]   We got a bunch of good ones today.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.700]   I even said to our expert guest host
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.460]   who kept coming on that we got some good ones.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.120]   Today's show is sponsored by Future Proof.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.040]   We're getting there.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.540]   I was just telling someone,
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.480]   I always get really sad when the summer's over
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.380]   because I hate cold weather,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.600]   which doesn't make sense since I live in Michigan.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.480]   But Future Proof, being in the middle of September,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.720]   gives me something to look forward to
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   to extend the summer a little bit.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   So they tell me August 15th is the last day
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.440]   that you can register for the conference
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.260]   and still get a discounted ticket.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.880]   Duncan may or may not be running a meetup
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.620]   for compound people, right?
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.660]   - It's true.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.380]   We're trying to keep it nice and pretty intimate, though,
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.220]   so don't tell everyone on a live stream or anything.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.820]   - Yeah, I kept out of the bag.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300]   Futureproof.advisorscircle.com.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.220]   It's gonna be a blast.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.700]   Can't wait.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.380]   - Yeah, I can't wait.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380]   - Let's do a question.
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320]   - Okay, so before we get started,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.260]   we have a lot of overlap between all of our shows.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.140]   I just wanted to address something you said yesterday
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.940]   that I felt like brought a little bit of shame
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   to everyone at the compound and the firm,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.600]   which was you were giving people a hard time
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.860]   about grinding coffee beans and getting whole bean coffee.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.080]   - Listen, someone was grinding coffee beans
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.980]   while we were recording the show,
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.280]   and I just said maybe, maybe people who grind
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.040]   their own coffee beans are like,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.600]   needs to take it easy a little bit.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.840]   - No, I mean, I get that.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.880]   People should not be grinding during a show, that's fair.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.720]   But you were kind of calling into question
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.040]   and if you could actually taste the difference.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.600]   So I just wanted to read a quick excerpt
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960]   from this book called-- - Craft Coffee.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.620]   - Craft Coffee, which is a bit of like a coffee Bible.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.460]   It says, "Many of the delicate compounds
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.580]   "that make coffee taste great
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.300]   "are locked in the bean's structure,
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.440]   "but breaking that protection apart via grinding
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.020]   "exposes them to air, moisture, and light,
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.860]   "the ever-present banes of a coffee bean's existence.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.260]   "All of those compounds will start to noticeably diminish,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.180]   "at least to the train palate,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.140]   "about 30 minutes after grinding.
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.760]   "And like the proverbial man who went out for cigarettes,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.260]   "once flavor is gone, it's not coming back."
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.340]   - Yeah, but doesn't Folgers grind them for you too?
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.180]   - Well, yeah, but I mean,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.580]   it starts to lose flavor quickly.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.860]   So if you grind them every morning,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.540]   right before you make it, you're getting more--
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.860]   - Okay, that sounded like the difference
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.140]   between me getting a drink
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.340]   and a mixologist pouring a drink for me.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100]   All I said was it's pretentious
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.200]   and you just made my point for me.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.900]   - Fair enough, fair enough, okay.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.940]   - Well, I guess I got a lot of hate on that one.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.380]   As a non-coffee drinker, I'm fine throwing bombs
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.340]   into that department 'cause I don't drink coffee.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.700]   - So while you're making your bed,
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.460]   we're grinding our coffee beans, you know what I mean?
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.380]   - Yes, you're a coffee mixologist.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.620]   - My God, okay. - Let's do a question.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.700]   - Up first today, we have a question from Salem.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.920]   "I'm looking to purchase a new home in the coming months
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.040]   "as I'm in need of additional space.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.500]   "I'm trying to decide whether to rent
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.020]   "or sell my existing home,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.620]   "which has a 3% interest rate and $200,000 in equity
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740]   "since I purchased it in 2016.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.600]   "My real estate agent and many pundits
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860]   "seem to default to renting it out as a no-brainer approach
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.760]   "because of the 3% interest rate.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.620]   "However, if I took the $200,000 profit from the sale
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.260]   "and invested in the S&P 500, over 30 years,
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.440]   "it would surpass the monthly rental profit, $600,
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.400]   "and eventual sale of the home.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.020]   "This includes investing the $600 profit
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.540]   "into the S&P each month over the same period.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.780]   "Finding quality tenants,
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.460]   "keeping the place rented at all times,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.580]   "and covering maintenance as the home ages
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.100]   "seems riskier than investing in something like VTI.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.700]   "I'm a long-term investor and volatility doesn't rattle me,
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.100]   "so outside of diversification,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.500]   "doesn't selling the home yield the greatest return?"
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.540]   - I really like this question
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.620]   because most financial questions
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.360]   are equal parts spreadsheet and behavioral psychology,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.980]   but this one is kind of like a heavyweight fight
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.820]   between spreadsheet and spreadsheet.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.480]   So John, let's do the tail of the tape,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.380]   Tyson and Holyfield style.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.940]   Rental properties versus index funds.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.180]   You can find pros and cons for each of these, right?
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.780]   There's a lot less volatility in owning real estate
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.660]   because you don't have a daily update of the price
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.100]   and people aren't trading it on a second-by-second basis.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.860]   You can increase the rental over time.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.220]   I think we've seen, especially in this latest cycle,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.500]   real estate is a great hedge
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.540]   against short-term and long-term inflation.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.820]   You can build equity when you have a rental property.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.940]   Obviously, Saleem pointed out some of the problems
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.620]   with it, the maintenance, the property taxes,
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.380]   the management of the property.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.940]   There's idiosyncratic risk because it's a single holding.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.500]   So I think they're looking at it the right way here.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.140]   And he's already run the numbers to kind of see here.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   I understand why, and I'm sure I left a few things off.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.700]   Johnny can do chart off here.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.020]   Let me first say there's no right or wrong answers here.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.500]   There are people who have built wealth
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.340]   investing in real estate.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.060]   There's people who've lost money investing in real estate.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.820]   There's people who've built wealth in the stock market.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.060]   People who've lost money in the stock market.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.260]   Like that, get that out of the way right now.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.420]   You could run all the numbers you want,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.260]   but I think personal preference is what wins here.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.980]   I understand why the real estate agent
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.580]   and some of the pundits are pushing you
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.740]   to turn your place into a rental.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.020]   I think a lot of people did that in the 2021 time.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.740]   It's like, if I'm gonna get a 3% mortgage at a new place,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.860]   why would I not just keep the old 3% one and rent it out?
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.620]   And it's one of the reasons that I think housing prices
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.580]   went up a little bit, 'cause people weren't putting
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.700]   as much housing as their supply on the market.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.580]   That 3% mortgage is one of the best financial assets
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.860]   you can carry in your personal balance sheet right now.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.700]   I've been pounding the table on that for a while, but.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.780]   So let's do a quick example.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.180]   Let's say you bought your house for 300,000 in 2016
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.380]   and are now selling it for 500.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.100]   That's the 200,000 discount or difference for your equity.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.580]   If you put 20% down at the time with a 3% mortgage,
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.100]   we're talking a $1,000 monthly payment, right?
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.940]   Now let's say you wanted to buy your house at going rates.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   That $500,000 house at 7% is more like a $2,700
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.500]   a month payment, just a huge,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.660]   plus your down payment would be $40,000 higher
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.140]   if we did 20% down for that.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.780]   But holding that 3% mortgage
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.180]   and turning into a rental property
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.600]   while appealing the fact that you get to grow equity,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.620]   if that's not your thing, it's not your thing.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.140]   Like, I don't think you wanna be peer pressured
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.620]   into doing something just because of that 3% mortgage.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.460]   And if it's gonna cause you sleepless nights
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.940]   and give you a headache, I don't see what's the point.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.140]   Like, the point about finding tenants is one for me.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.940]   Like, if a tenant leaves and you have to find a new one
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.780]   and you have a few months
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.900]   where you're not earning that income,
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.420]   that can eat into your profit in a big way, right?
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.940]   He mentioned that this, I think his house was built in 2000
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.940]   and he realized, like, I'm gonna have to do some upgrades
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.420]   on this relatively quickly.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.940]   One new roof or a new air conditioner
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.940]   or a new heater or something,
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.100]   and there goes your profit for a few months, maybe a year.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.220]   So I think some people are more equipped than others
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.920]   to deal with the realities of being a landlord.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.760]   And I think you have to figure out
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.180]   what your tolerance for inconvenience is.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.020]   And so there is a good case to be made
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.220]   for taking your money, your equity off the table,
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.380]   investing it in the stock market.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.500]   But there could be scenarios where the rental income
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.620]   and the equity you build in the house
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.220]   puts you in a better place financially over the years.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.220]   You really don't know.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.580]   So this is the type of decision, as usual,
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.820]   I would make completely outside of this spreadsheet.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.280]   If you don't want to be a landlord,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.420]   owning a rental property is not for you
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.700]   no matter how good the economics of it are,
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.580]   even if it works out.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.700]   Like, what's the point of giving yourself a headache?
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.060]   So I don't think all financial decisions
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.540]   have to be made based on levels of interest rates or ROI.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.380]   I think you have to focus
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.660]   on the potential headaches involved here.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.500]   And if you don't want to,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.460]   I personally would not have the heart
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.100]   to own a rental property.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.140]   I just, I wouldn't be able to have other people
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.380]   be in my house or in my place that I own
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.460]   or apartment or whatever it is,
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.780]   and potentially trash it and not know who the tenants are.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.700]   I wouldn't be able to psychologically
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.300]   sleep at night with that.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.220]   So, I mean, I know-
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.180]   - Yeah, it's like you can't care too much about it, right?
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.180]   But I mean, but then you want to make sure
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.660]   it's a nice place, but-
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.140]   - Yeah, and other people are just fine with that.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.940]   And they hire a property manager and they vet the tenants
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.380]   and it works out fine and they make money.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.940]   But for me, I wouldn't do it just 'cause someone says
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.780]   you can't get rid of that 3% mortgage.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.940]   'Cause then what if you hold onto it
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.740]   and in two years, rates go down?
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.100]   You know, it's just do whatever works for you.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.740]   And it sounds like you don't want to be a landlord,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.460]   so don't be a landlord.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.500]   - Yeah.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.420]   - I'm fine with that.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.940]   - Yeah, I don't think I'd want to be a landlord.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.780]   - No, it's a lot of work.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.700]   - You know what I would rather invest in?
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.860]   I would rather buy a parking lot.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.380]   You know, what do you have to do to a parking lot?
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.860]   - That's true, paint the lines.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.700]   - Yeah.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.460]   - All right, next question. - Good business idea.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.300]   Okay, up next, we have a question from James.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.180]   "I love the idea of set it and forget it target date funds.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.420]   "You guys recently talked about a Wall Street Journal
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.560]   "article that showed boomers are hooked on equities.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.660]   "I agree with Ben that more and more older people
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.420]   "are going to up their equity holdings.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.420]   "Can you guys explain why target date funds,
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.060]   "especially long horizon ones,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.900]   "have a bond allocation at all?
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.980]   "Vanguard's 2065 target date fund holds 54% US stocks,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.620]   "36% international stocks, 6.7% US bonds,
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.140]   "and 2.8% international bonds.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.800]   "Why would anybody with a 42-year time horizon
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.200]   "want an allocation to bonds?"
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.620]   - As a target date aficionado,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.180]   I'm well-suited to answer this question.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.680]   I've looked into this before.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.460]   Basically, every target date fund you have,
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.580]   maybe there's a provider somewhere,
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.100]   but most of them have at least like a eight to 10%
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.520]   allocation to bonds, no matter how far out you look, right?
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.420]   This person's saying 2065, 2070,
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.120]   any of those will have a little bit of bonds.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.560]   And I mean, the great thing about target date funds
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.060]   is that it's broadly diversified.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.620]   You automatically get to rebalance it.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.980]   It's run by a portfolio manager, a team of managers.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.820]   It's low cost.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.580]   It's like simplicity at its finest.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.740]   That's what I love about it.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.380]   There are some drawbacks to these funds, of course.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.900]   Like you don't get to pick the asset allocation
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.500]   of the funds that are involved.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.240]   There's no customization beyond picking a fund
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.580]   that's more or less growth oriented,
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.140]   depending on what year you pick, right?
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.300]   2060 or 2065 or 2050.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.060]   So the bond piece is a fair question.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.340]   "Why would anyone with a multi-decade time horizon
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.260]   "want to own bonds?"
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.940]   First off, bonds are not forever.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.720]   We've had a handful of questions this year
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.260]   on the show alone about keeping 100%
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.780]   of your retirement portfolio in stocks.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.480]   And there are people who have the ability to stomach that.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.960]   I've mentioned my retirement portfolio is all equity.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.100]   I do keep cash in an online savings account,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.400]   even some T-bills, money markets,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.100]   but no bonds for me at the moment in retirement.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.220]   That will likely change as I get closer to retirement,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.720]   but all stock portfolios aren't for everyone.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.360]   So even if bonds don't have the same expected returns
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.880]   as stocks over the long run,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.480]   I think investing in bonds could be a hedge
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.900]   against bad investment decisions.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.420]   For people who just can't stomach the ups and downs
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.500]   of the stock market.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.960]   So they can dampen the volatility,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.620]   they can dampen the volatility of your portfolio,
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.380]   but also your emotions.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.260]   I think bond yields are much higher now than they have been,
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.700]   but even if bond yields go back down,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.660]   I think they can still help people,
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.260]   certain investors from making the wrong move
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.520]   at the wrong time.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.260]   And it didn't happen last year,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.620]   but high quality bonds will do the trick
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.260]   in the majority of market crashes, right?
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.500]   The bond market essentially causes
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.100]   the stock market crash last year.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.700]   So if keeping 10% or 20% in bonds
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.660]   allows you to stay invested in the other 90 or 80% of stocks,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.820]   I think that's a worthy allocation.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.100]   I think that's the thinking,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.100]   that they want broad diversification.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.940]   And if you want to just supplement the target date fund,
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.980]   own the target date fund,
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.480]   and then buy an index fund of the rest of it,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.100]   or just take the funds in that target date fund,
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.060]   get rid of the bond funds and just buy the stock funds
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.260]   and set an automatic rebalance, and you're fine.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.140]   I understand you want to take the simplicity
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.860]   of the target date fund,
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.140]   but there's enough fund providers out there
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.100]   that will do an automatic rebalance for you,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.060]   where you can create your own if you want.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.380]   - Yeah, I think that's key for young people
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.580]   that are new to all of this to understand,
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.860]   is that, yeah, the idea traditionally is
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.320]   stocks are going down, bonds are going up,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.700]   so then you can rebalance.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.740]   And so you're using that bond money
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.580]   to buy more stocks at a lower price.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.740]   - Yeah, that's the big part of it is the dry powder.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.020]   Like if you want to buy stocks
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.700]   and you don't have new savings coming in
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.540]   during a bear market,
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.000]   those bonds can act as not only a stabilizer,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.600]   but also dry powder for rebalancing into the pain.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.720]   That's part of it too.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.480]   Even if they have lower expected returns.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.320]   I get it.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.820]   If you want to be 100% in stocks,
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.300]   you're probably just gonna have to build that yourself though.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.660]   - Right.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.680]   - Which isn't that hard either.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.140]   You could, again, you could buy a target date fund
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.900]   and just buy more stocks.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.340]   So it takes it from 10% to 5%,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.940]   depending on how you utilize it.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.780]   - Yeah.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.540]   I'm waiting for the leveraged target date funds
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.380]   to come online.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.940]   - Okay, the T target date funds.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.500]   All right.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.900]   - Okay.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.540]   Up next, we have a question from Chad.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.160]   I'm actually surprised no academic has done that yet.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.680]   Because a lot of the academic studies say,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   if you're a young person,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   you should leverage your stock portfolio.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.600]   'Cause you have the ability to wait out bear markets
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.200]   and save more if you blow yourself up.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.820]   I'm surprised no one's tried that yet.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.840]   - Well that's, I mean, Sean called me out
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.160]   and let you guys know,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.280]   but I was asking him a while back about like,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.240]   what's stopping you from having a portfolio
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.760]   that's basically like triple, you know, triple Q's
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.920]   and then like hedged with some short triple Q's
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.320]   and like doing it kind of like a hedge fund.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.820]   I was trying to piece it together.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.960]   I was talking with Sean about this.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.940]   (laughing)
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.780]   - I'm not even gonna talk.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.540]   That sounds way too complicated.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.340]   Just take the leverage off and keep it at a hundred
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.540]   instead of trying to leverage and then hedge the leverage.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.380]   - Yeah. - Keep it simple.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.240]   Occam's razor here, Duncan.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.080]   - It's true.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.020]   I'm reading that hedge fund book of, you know,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.340]   more money than God right now.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.380]   So it's on my mind.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.580]   - All right.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.420]   - Okay.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.140]   Up next, we have a question from Chad.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.940]   How do you decide between a traditional 401k
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.360]   and a Roth 401k when you have no idea
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.380]   whether you'll end up in the 22, 24, 32, 35
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.740]   or 37% tax bracket?
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.740]   I'm 43, married, filing jointly with two kids,
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.580]   two young kids with a not to brag base salary
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.900]   of $175,000 in the 22% MFJ.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.180]   So married, filing jointly bracket.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.100]   In 2022 bonuses jumped my salary all the way
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.860]   into the 35% bracket.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.140]   How do you factor in things like the larger take-home
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.340]   paycheck with traditional versus Roth
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.300]   or the fact that when kids get older,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.780]   I won't have those tax credits reducing my taxable income
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.900]   or the fact that RMDs for whichever one of us
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.780]   survives longer might be taxed as single rather than MFJ?
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.860]   - Well, there's a lot going on.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.020]   I'm tapping out on this one.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.900]   There's way too much tax stuff going on.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.620]   Let's bring in our tech expert here.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.460]   - Get in here, Bill.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.860]   - Bill Sweet.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.700]   - Hey, Bill.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.540]   Oh, nice.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.360]   - He's ground some coffee beans.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.260]   - Isn't that Chemex?
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.940]   - It was, yes, when I got started.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.020]   But are we going to take coffee advice
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.020]   from a guy that, A, doesn't drink coffee
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.500]   and recommended Folgers?
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.460]   Speaking about more money than God.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.980]   I mean, come on, live a little, Ben.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.140]   - How else are you going to retire, Bill,
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.540]   if you don't drink Folgers?
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.140]   - And avocado toast.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.220]   But no, great, great question from Chaz, my guy Chaz.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.180]   - Let's start off this, though.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.100]   - Yeah, what's up?
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.440]   - Has Chad not already won the game
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.620]   if he's getting this in the weeds?
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.500]   - I mean, I was going to say it's double not to brag
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.900]   on Chaz's original question.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.900]   You know, his base hour, he gets him at 22%,
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.620]   but the 35% bracket starts at $490,000 of gross income.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.100]   - Oh, so he's getting a pretty good bonus.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.180]   - Yeah, wow, that's quite a year for Chaz.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.020]   And looking back, I mean, the way I would frame it, though,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.280]   we've talked a lot about Roth versus traditional.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.680]   The answer is both, right?
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.420]   So the way to answer Chaz's multiple questions here
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.580]   is to look back from age 63.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.300]   What do you want to have in retirement?
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.720]   And Ben, if we knew what the best performing asset class
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.820]   would be over the next 20 years,
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.420]   we would obviously invest there, but we don't.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.340]   So what do we do instead?
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.180]   - Right, diversify.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.140]   - We diversify.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.100]   And so diversification works for tax planning, too.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.540]   What I would recommend to Chaz is,
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.500]   in a year in the 35% bracket,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.940]   that to me would go full tilt for traditional, right?
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.420]   'Cause there's only one more step you can go into 37%,
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.500]   but maybe in years that are not so great, you know, 24%.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.100]   Because if we fast forward, Chaz,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.820]   if you're looking at age 63 backwards,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.940]   let's say you have Social Security
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.900]   pumping out $3,000 a month,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.660]   you can then distribute another $80,000 or so
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.900]   at today's current tax brackets and tax rates,
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.660]   ignoring inflation for a moment,
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.500]   at the 12% tax rate, right?
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.980]   So I think you do have to do a little arbitrage
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   and think ahead,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.020]   and do that financial planning exercise looking backwards.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.320]   But ultimately, I don't think the answer is either/or.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.100]   I think it's how much and when.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.420]   And if you're 43
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.060]   and you're earning a half million dollars a year,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.020]   I think you're full tilt traditional at that point,
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.280]   because your tax rate is probably
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.620]   gonna not be much higher.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.660]   37% is as high as it goes,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   but in years that you can skirt under that 22% range,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.420]   or let's say 10 years ago,
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.900]   if you're young, if you're starting out,
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.300]   that's when Roth makes more sense.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.820]   - My thought was, with a question this complex,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.260]   it does seem relatively complex
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.780]   because there's so many paths you can take,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.020]   it's very path-dependent.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.340]   Like, what's the simplest solution?
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.820]   I think the simplest solution, as you said,
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.500]   is do a little bit of each
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.800]   and don't try to get too cute with it.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.980]   Because if you try to say,
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.180]   this year I'm gonna do this,
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.260]   but then at the end of the year,
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.940]   I figured I can't do it anymore and then I'm gonna do this,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.020]   so I feel like, just make it easy on yourself.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.420]   - Sorry, Cliff is cracking me up in the chat.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.540]   He said, "I would quit the job to save on taxes."
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.500]   (laughing)
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.980]   - That's it, and that's, Duncan,
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.940]   I say that to clients a lot.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.420]   There's a very easy way to save on taxes.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.140]   - Then you don't have to pay for a CPA either.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.300]   So yeah, that's all your solution.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.140]   - No, that's it.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.640]   But just a couple of other things that Chad brings up.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.700]   I mean, the tax credits for having kids
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.820]   are gonna be there regardless.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.860]   Like, that all happens after your taxable income
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.700]   gets calculated.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.220]   - Hey, wait, when does that go away?
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.060]   - Ooh, that goes, yeah.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.420]   - So when are my three tax credits going away?
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.500]   - The year your kids turn 16, actually.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.340]   - 16?
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.260]   - Yep, 16. - Oh, man.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.940]   - Yeah, so that happens pretty quickly,
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.780]   depending on where you are. - I should boot 'em
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:15.600]   out of the house then.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.440]   - Yeah, you could.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.820]   I mean, that's my rule for my kids.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.300]   Once you're 18, you're out of the house.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.140]   (laughing)
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.960]   You're not my problem anymore, good luck.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.800]   - At 16, they need a job.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.660]   - Yeah, more or less. - You have to book credit.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.700]   - But yeah, but I think the basic rule of thumb here
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.500]   is 12% or around there, or if you have a long time horizon,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.060]   Roth IRAs make a lot of sense,
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.060]   especially if you expect your future tax rate
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.020]   to be higher than your current tax rate.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.940]   The other factor is mid-career,
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.140]   when you're starting to pump up,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.380]   if you're hitting that 32, that 35, that 37% bracket,
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.700]   that's when I go traditional.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.940]   That, I think, is a good rule of thumb.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.740]   - Fair, see, it's not always Roth for Bill.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.580]   - Nope, it's not.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.800]   - The one guy, a couple months ago,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.780]   said you were too far into the Roth.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.540]   - A lot of the listeners, yeah, have called me out,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.460]   and I think that's it,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.300]   but when I look at people's portfolio spend,
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.820]   I don't see enough Roth IRA assets,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.420]   so that's what's led me to be the acolyte that I am.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.380]   - That makes sense.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.100]   - And about coffee beans, too, grind your own coffee.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.020]   How hard is this?
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.060]   It's not that hard.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.440]   - Can we get a silent coffee grinder, please?
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.280]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.060]   - Like, you know how Duncan put the soundproof stuff
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.140]   on the walls in the podcast booth there?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.500]   Just do some soundproofing, that's all I'm asking.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.220]   - There are some that are a lot quieter, yeah.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.700]   - Yeah, it's true, and we have dustless brake pads for cars.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.540]   Why can't we get a quiet coffee grinder?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.660]   - I think I'm just a little bitter
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.940]   because my wife had a roommate in college,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.900]   and she would get up every day at 5.30 a.m.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.780]   to go to her internship,
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.260]   and she'd grind her coffee beans and wake us up,
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.380]   and it just--
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.220]   - Wow.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.100]   - Since then, it's just--
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.880]   - So, it would have been more respectful
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.220]   for her to grind them the night before.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.900]   You lose a little bit of flavor, but, you know.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.720]   - Right.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.560]   - Come on, like, you could have done that.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.400]   - That's what I'm saying, disrespectful.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.480]   All right, let's do another question.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.960]   - Oh, also, before we move on from that question,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.080]   we just had Adam, Adam, a long-time listener
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.600]   of all the pods, just stop by the office,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   and he was telling me the top tax rate in Canada,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.600]   he's from Toronto, is, I think he said 55%.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   - So, he was asking for us to do some
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.880]   Canadian-specific tax questions at some point.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.360]   - Yeah, it's something nobody believes in me,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.720]   but yeah, U.S. taxes are actually very, very favorable
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   compared to OECD countries, in the lower third,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.480]   but it doesn't feel that way,
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.000]   so I try not to convince people of what they already know.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.840]   - Yeah.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.960]   All right, up next, we have a question from David.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.240]   I will take my first RMD in 2024,
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   and I'm considering a backdoor Roth.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.720]   I will not need the majority of the RMD in 2024,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.280]   or subsequent years.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   I was not able to contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.320]   during my working years due to income limitations.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.280]   My thinking is that it may make sense
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.360]   to do a backdoor Roth on the RMD
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.620]   after having paid the income taxes on the RMD.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.080]   My time horizon is approximately 20 years.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.680]   I understand that there is a five-year rule
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.960]   for withdrawing money from a Roth.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.020]   Does the five-year rule clock apply
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.620]   only starting with my first Roth deposit in 2024,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.800]   or to subsequent contributions in 2025 and beyond?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.200]   My taxable brokerage account is direct index for tax alpha,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.600]   so it would seem that tax-free growth in a Roth
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.840]   would provide better long-term returns.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.680]   I gotta be honest, I don't understand a lot of this question.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.940]   - Okay, so the idea is-- - I need to break this down.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.360]   - It sounds to me like they're taking
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.980]   their required minimum distributions,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.940]   but they're not going to need to spend them right away,
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.640]   so they want to reinvest them
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.500]   and maybe get some tax deferral benefits
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.960]   by putting them in a backdoor Roth.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.600]   - Right, right, yep.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.040]   Duncan, I don't think it's your fault.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   There's a lot going on.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.280]   First off, RMD started at age 73,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   so I give our questioner a lot of credit
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.120]   for thinking in a long time horizon.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   20 years, that's great,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.640]   and God willing, we all make it that far.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.520]   But yeah, a lot going on here.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.080]   But number one is you cannot take an RMD
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.760]   if you're receiving one-- - And for new people,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.540]   an RMD is a required minimum distribution.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.160]   - Required minimum distribution, right.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.360]   Exactly, Duncan, and as those build up,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.920]   as your assets build up, at some point,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.520]   the government says, look, you gotta spend the money.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.280]   Yeah, you can't just have this build up forever,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.420]   and as I said before, that starts at age 73
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.040]   here in the year 2023.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.320]   But you cannot take an RMD
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.840]   and just move it from one traditional into a Roth.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.400]   It doesn't happen quite that way.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.600]   You do need to have earned income
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.640]   in order to contribute to any IRA.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.360]   So that's the first kind of nuanced point here
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.440]   is that you can't just take assets from traditional,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.280]   roll them into Roth.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.520]   - Social security doesn't count, huh?
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.040]   - Social security neither, but that's it.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.200]   But to move on, again, 20 years
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.720]   is a pretty favorable time horizon,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.400]   and what the listener is comparing
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.780]   a backdoor Roth contribution to
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.440]   is a direct indexed account, right,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.760]   something that's taxable.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.400]   And Ben, if I could give you the choice,
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.680]   would you want your investment earnings tax-free
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.840]   or would you want them taxed as capital gains?
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.160]   Which would you choose?
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.840]   - Tax-free. - You want them tax-free.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.780]   - So what, you're saying move it right from the,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.000]   so take the RMD and then put it
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.400]   into the direct index account?
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.280]   - No, I'm saying do this backdoor Roth solution.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.860]   You do need to have earned income.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.120]   And so if you're comparing it to an investment
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.240]   that's going to be taxed,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   the backdoor Roth is gonna make sense
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.800]   because you've already paid tax on that income.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.000]   You've already taken that required distribution.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.160]   So assuming you have the other earned income,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.960]   you can put $7,500 into a Roth IRA up to any age
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.080]   as long as you have the income to support it.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.640]   So that's an important question to focus on.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.560]   - Okay. - Next.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.080]   There are two five-year rules
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.800]   when it comes to Roth IRAs that we can go into.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.400]   - I didn't get the five-year rule thing, what's that?
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.840]   - Yeah, okay, so there are two.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   The five-year rule number one,
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.000]   you cannot take a qualified Roth distribution
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.520]   from any Roth IRA until you've had
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.260]   any Roth IRA for five years.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.480]   And so it is literally,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   you just have to have a Roth IRA in place for five years.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.400]   Any distributions that happen in year two,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.840]   year three, year four are not qualified.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.040]   And so that's one of the reasons I apostolized it.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.280]   Like, look guys, just fund a Roth IRA now in your 20s,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.760]   because then that five-year clock is done and over with.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.260]   So that's five-year clock number one.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.760]   If we're starting at age 73
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.600]   and we've never made a Roth IRA contribution--
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.200]   - Wait, what's the reason for the five-year clock?
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.040]   I don't get that.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.680]   - I think the idea is that they don't want people
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.000]   just putting money into Roth, into IRAs,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.320]   and then taking them out the next year.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.360]   I don't really fully understand it, Ben, to be honest,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.520]   but I think the intent was that,
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.440]   look, these are long-term retirement accounts.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.640]   These are not meant to be, like,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.840]   someplace to park cash for a year or two.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.240]   Now, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.040]   because once you do that once,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.320]   then the one first five-year rule no longer applies.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.720]   But the second five-year rule is relating to rollovers.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   And if you take assets out of a Roth IRA
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.760]   after you've done a Roth IRA conversion,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.220]   then that could be subject to penalties and interest, too,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.440]   if you take it out in the five years after a conversion.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.560]   However, the Roth IRA ordering rules
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   are super funky and complex.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.040]   I don't wanna get into them.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.400]   But it's very unlikely that if you have a balance
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.720]   in a Roth IRA, that's gonna be a problem for you.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.880]   But one thing that we know about this listener
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.340]   is they're 73, and no penalties apply
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.280]   for any type of distribution,
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.680]   unless it's that first five-year clock.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.080]   So backdoor Roths are fine
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   if you're over the retirement age of 59 1/2,
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.200]   which this listener is.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   So it's really complex.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.960]   I don't think we need to go into the nuance of it,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.640]   but ultimately, I think it's probably a good idea
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.800]   as long as you have earned income
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.680]   to support the Roth IRA contribution.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.320]   - So once again, job security for Bill Sweet
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.120]   and other CPAs around the country.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.520]   - And it gets more and more complex.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.800]   The SECURE Act, as you know, Ben,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.000]   just changed the rules on inherited IRAs,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.560]   and boy, we could do a whole asset compound on that.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.400]   But we won't. - Oh, good.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.160]   See, I was afraid it was getting too boring.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.520]   - Okay, so if anyone has questions on inherited IRAs,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.240]   ask for the next one. - Bring 'em on.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.080]   Bring 'em on. - All right.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.320]   One more question.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.160]   This is a good one. - Okay.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.120]   - Good one for Bill, too.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.960]   - Yeah. - It is.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.240]   Last but not least, we have a question from Chris.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.520]   How do you factor a pension
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.320]   into your retirement savings rate?
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.360]   I'm a 36-year-old Army officer
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   and will be eligible to retire from the service
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.880]   at the age of 42 with a pension that equates
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.160]   to about 42% of my annual income,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.280]   adjusted annually for inflation.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.260]   I'll continue to work in another industry
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.720]   until at least 55 to replace the lost income.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.700]   My wife and I are first-time homebuyers
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.920]   and closing on a house this week.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.460]   We'll be stretching a bit on payments
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.400]   for the first three years until my promotion in 2026,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.800]   and I plan to pause retirement contributions
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.600]   to build our savings account back up.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.040]   Not to brag, but we currently have about $450,000
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.520]   in our 401(k) and IRA.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.960]   Am I foolish for thinking that a 5% to 7%
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.640]   retirement savings rate is sufficient for folks
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.760]   with a good head start on retirement savings
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.680]   and a government-backed pension on the horizon?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.800]   - A lot going on in this one, too.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.840]   Bill, correct me if I'm wrong. - This is a good place
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.920]   for you to mention, Ben, too,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.140]   like you said on Animal Spirits,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.960]   how many people ever had pensions.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.020]   It's not as many as people think.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.180]   - Yes, yes, yeah, I was gonna, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.580]   I'm writing a piece about that right now, actually.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.340]   It wasn't as prevalent as people think.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.620]   40-some percent was as high as it got in the '70s,
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.540]   and that's the peak.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.500]   Bill, correct me if I'm wrong here,
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   but your origin story of getting into the world of finance
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.380]   was you were in a leadership position in the Army,
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.040]   and all the young people in your platoon
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.380]   were finally making decent money
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.340]   for the first time in their lives,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.580]   and they were coming to you for advice.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.860]   Is that right, pretty much?
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.900]   - Yeah, kind of, kind of.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.600]   So what happens is, when you reach a certain level
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.880]   of staff officer, they start assigning additional duties,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.480]   and when you get volunteered, you do not volunteer,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   you get volunteered to take a position.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.320]   Mine happened to be tax assistance officer,
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.340]   and so it was my job to help soldiers
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.000]   that were coming from Missouri or Idaho or whatever,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.040]   and they had a tax question.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.600]   It was my job to get them resources to solve that,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.100]   and yes, that's part of how I got into this crazy business.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.920]   - So the pension adjusted for inflation
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.160]   sounds like a pretty darn good deal,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.080]   'cause most pensions for a private employee
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.480]   do not get adjusted for inflation.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.960]   Social Security is one of the only ones I know
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.320]   that actually gets adjusted for inflation.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   So we try to never say never or always here,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   but I would assume most government pensions are pretty safe.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.440]   So I think planning on that is,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.620]   Chris is probably gonna be pretty good.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.840]   So the idea is, listen,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.240]   we've already built up a pretty good nest egg,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.200]   mid 30s and already have almost half a million dollars saved.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.160]   Can we do a lower than Ben sets as target for savings rate
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.360]   because I have this pension?
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.840]   Like if you did a present value,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.520]   it'd be worth, a pension is worth a lot more money
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.020]   than people assume.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.960]   So he's probably in a pretty good position
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.760]   because they blew through their savings for this house
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.320]   and they might not need to.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.280]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.680]   And I think it kind of does, right?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.600]   - Yeah, it definitely does.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.680]   So Defense Finance Accounting Service
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.400]   runs the military pension system,
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.080]   and ultimately it is indexed for inflation.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.520]   The same cost of living adjustment
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.200]   that rolls out for Social Security every year
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.160]   would apply to a military pension too.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   And so as the listener points out,
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.840]   hey, this is gonna cover 40% of my spending
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.520]   when I get to retirement, which is great.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.000]   State income tax free, right?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.540]   So if you move to New York, California,
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.260]   they can't touch your pension.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.840]   It's always federally taxable.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.120]   But yeah, I'd say it's a great deal.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.540]   And Ben, what is really the difference?
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.600]   A government pension, a government bond,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.340]   like these are all things that are guaranteed
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.360]   by the full faith and credit
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.840]   of the United States of America.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.000]   I'd say, yeah, go for it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.920]   And so Ben, sometimes in my formulation,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.640]   it really unfortunately all depends,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.740]   but sometimes I will treat this like a bond, right?
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.860]   And that's my fixed income
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.920]   because I know that's gonna support my lifestyle.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.280]   I know that's gonna hit my paycheck,
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.040]   my bank account every month.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.680]   I think it's an excellent way to plan.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.200]   And yes, if you'd like to, I think so.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.780]   Is it more or less you've funded part of your retirement,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.820]   not through your savings,
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.540]   but through the work that you've been doing
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.500]   to defend our nation.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.840]   So I think that's a really neat thing to think about.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.720]   That's another good point is that they could also
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.840]   probably take more risk in their 401k and IRA in stocks
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.160]   because that pension is going to act like a bond,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.240]   even though it doesn't have some of the same characteristics
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.320]   as a bond fund would.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.160]   - I think so too.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.320]   And ultimately, when you sit down to sort of do the planning
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.160]   that can continue on with your surviving spouse,
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.680]   I think it's 50% of the default.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.040]   So there's a couple of elections that you do need to make.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.180]   You can think about life insurance
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.800]   to cover the balance otherwise.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.920]   But I would totally agree.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.520]   And I think that does more or less de-risk
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.780]   some of your retirement spending
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.380]   because you have that ace in the hole
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.680]   with the federal government.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.240]   - And that's the way to think about retirement too,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.640]   planning from a withdrawal perspective is,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.680]   if I have income that's going to be covering
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.040]   a certain percentage of what I'm going to be spending,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.140]   I don't need to take as much from my portfolio each year.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.720]   So maybe the nest egg doesn't have to be quite as big.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.840]   So yeah, they could spend more now in the house
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.140]   or whatever it is that they're doing and not save as much.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.400]   And they'll probably be just fine.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.240]   - Precisely.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.400]   And it connects directly, Ben,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.120]   with the conversation we had a couple of minutes ago
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.800]   about traditional versus Roth.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.360]   Fast forward a couple of years, fast forward 20, 30 years,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.660]   what would you like your portfolio to look like then?
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.920]   I want to take this amount of distributions here.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.040]   I want to have this bucket of, let's say, Roth assets
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.520]   in case I want to buy a house, take my kids to Paris,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.200]   something like that, have fun, one-time spend,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.720]   but backwards plan and decide,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.040]   what do I need to do at this point to fund it?
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.320]   But ultimately, really, what they're saying is,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.560]   I'm going to divert some of my retirement savings
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.400]   into this real estate project, right?
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.680]   And I think that's great.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.960]   I mean, that's a use asset,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.920]   and then it'll be there when you do retire
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.720]   and you can head on.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.800]   - Yeah, thinking through this stuff at age 36,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.240]   I think they're in a pretty good position.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.080]   - I would agree.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.900]   And thank you very much for serving our country,
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.940]   keeping it safe out there
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.620]   so we can sleep safe in our beds at night.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.460]   Thank you.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.280]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.420]   And yeah, good job.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.260]   - Good job.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.080]   - Yeah, nicely.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.920]   Yeah, good job.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.760]   - Great question.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.580]   - That's great.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.420]   And we didn't even get to not to brag there,
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.240]   even though they deserved one.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.340]   - Yeah.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.380]   - All right, we want to thank Bill
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.380]   for getting back five minutes before the show
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.780]   from vacation to help us out.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.020]   - Neither rain nor sleet nor the Pocono Mountains
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.800]   will keep me from my appointed rounds.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.900]   - Yes, next week.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.940]   I know I angered a lot of people who drink coffee.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.180]   Next week, I'm going to talk about how I hate IPAs,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.460]   and I also don't like "Star Wars."
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.000]   - Sponsored by Folgers.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.860]   - Wants to email me.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.940]   - Ben, his elitist tower there in Michigan
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.780]   looking down on us humble New Yorkers.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.020]   - You're going to be here in person.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.860]   We're going to hold you down
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.540]   and make you drink coffee live on the show.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.380]   - That's right.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.900]   I will be live in New York City next week,
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.340]   sitting next to Duncan.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.220]   Email us if you want.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.580]   We're going to have a bunch of different people
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.420]   on the show next week
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.860]   because we have a lot of people coming to New York.

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.660]   - See you, everyone.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.380]   (upbeat music)

[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.400]   you
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.460]   you
