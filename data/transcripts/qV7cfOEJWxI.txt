[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340]   big news for the National
[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.900]   Association of Realtors. They've
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.220]   agreed to pay $418 million in a
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.620]   settlement last week, people are
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.980]   freaking out about it. As you
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.380]   know, the seller of a home pays
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.260]   the buyer's agents Commission
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.540]   buyers are responsible for paying
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.860]   their agents commissions going
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.340]   forward. It's always been crazy
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.700]   to me that anyone would pay a
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700]   percent of absolute value. It
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.180]   makes no sense. I bought a home
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.300]   for a million. I'm selling it for
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.340]   a million one. So I've made $100,000
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.980]   profit, but I got to pay $60,000
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380]   of my total gross to an agent to
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.340]   sell it for 60% of the profit, I
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.940]   just gave him 60% of my profit on
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.980]   my home, right? It makes no sense.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.580]   And the crazy thing is that a bad
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.740]   sale of your home would be let's
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.980]   call it 900,000 or a million and a
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.100]   great sale would be 1.2. So
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.780]   exactly. There's a very small
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.600]   margin where they actually have an
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.040]   impact based on the quality of
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.060]   their effort, but they get
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.300]   compensated for the whole thing.
