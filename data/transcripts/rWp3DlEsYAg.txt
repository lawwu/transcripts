[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   On this podcast, we frequently return to fundamental realities, the essential truths, the things
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   most precious to us.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.240]   Things like the glory of God and the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.280]   If you get these fundamentals right, everything else eventually falls into place.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.140]   Get these fundamentals wrong, and nothing will fall exactly into place.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.320]   Something will always be off.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   In light of this, some of the most essential questions include these.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.260]   Why in the first place do I need to be saved?
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.780]   Saved from whom?
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.780]   Saved from what?
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.140]   What is my problem?
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.240]   And how do God, and specifically Christ himself, address my problem?
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.340]   To explain, I love this following sermon excerpt from a 2009 message delivered at a campus
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.980]   crusade event in Minneapolis.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.760]   There Pastor John expounded Romans chapter 3, verses 23 to 26, a text in which the Apostle
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.800]   Paul says this, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.560]   by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.660]   as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.840]   This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.600]   former sins.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.120]   It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just, and the justifier
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.920]   of the one who has faith in Jesus."
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880]   A glorious text of essential, must-know truth.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.280]   Here's Pastor John to explain it.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.400]   Verse 25, "Whom," referring to Christ, "God put forward as a propitiation," that means
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.480]   a sacrifice that removes wrath.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:05.520]   So the wrath of God is absorbed by Christ when he dies in our place.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.120]   So propitiation is the removal of the wrath of God off of us, though we deserve it.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.480]   "Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood," so his death, "to be received
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   by faith."
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.920]   That's how you receive a gift.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.480]   Faith is a receiving, it's not a doing.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.720]   This was to show God's righteousness.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.680]   Oh, really?
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400]   Really?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.120]   This putting Christ forward is to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.200]   patience, he has passed over former sins.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:04.520]   It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just, and the justifier
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.480]   of the one who has faith in Jesus.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   I don't think there's a more important paragraph in the Bible than that right there.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.560]   I mean, there may be some competing.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.400]   That's just about as close to the center as you can get.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.440]   Take it apart for just a few minutes with me.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   God put Christ forward as a propitiation by his blood.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.880]   Romans 8, 3, "What the law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did, sending
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:42.280]   his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   Whose sin?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   Tell me.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Mine.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   Whose flesh?
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   Christ's.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   You got it.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.000]   That's an amazing statement.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.840]   Condemnation happened at the cross.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   Whose?
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   Mine.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.560]   In whose flesh?
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.040]   Not mine.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.000]   This is propitiation.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.760]   Propitiation is the drawing away of condemnation from me.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   How can this be?
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   How can it go there?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.640]   It belongs here.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:23.800]   Or Galatians 3, 13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.560]   for us."
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   Whose curse?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   God's curse.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.040]   He's the one that backs up the law.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.400]   The law is his word.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   If there's a curse in the law on me, it's coming from God.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.320]   And Jesus becomes my curse.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.440]   So all that to say yes to propitiation.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   Don't translate it some other way.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.120]   Don't use expiation, which simply means removal of guilt.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.280]   Don't translate it merely living sacrifice or sacrificial offering.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:04.720]   It's the removal of God Almighty's just, holy condemnation and wrath, which belongs to me.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   Why did he need to do it that way?
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:15.720]   Why did Christ need to die in order to placate God's wrath?
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   Verse 25 in the middle, "This was to show God's righteousness."
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.160]   So Christ died.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.040]   God put him forward to die.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.920]   This was to show God's righteousness.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.120]   Why did he need to show his righteousness?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.240]   That's a pretty high price for a demonstration of righteousness.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   Why did he need to show his righteousness?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:53.880]   End of verse 25, "Because in his divine forbearance he passed over former sins."
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:05.000]   Well, why does passing over sin make it necessary to demonstrate righteousness?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.840]   Now we're ready to see verse 23 in the nature of sin.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.680]   I don't know if you've ever felt like I want you to feel
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.360]   the connection between sin and the glory of God.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.440]   "All have sinned and fall short."
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.520]   What is "fall short"?
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.240]   It's an old-fashioned translation.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   The literal meaning is "they lack."
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.120]   They're without.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.240]   In what way without?
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.880]   In chapter 1 of Romans, verse 23, it says,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.080]   "We have exchanged the glory of God for the glory of created things."
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.720]   So we had it.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   It was our treasure.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   When Adam and Eve were created, it was our treasure.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   We loved God.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   We cherished God.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.920]   We esteemed God.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.400]   We respected God.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.800]   We were in awe of God and worshipped God and praised God and glorified God.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.520]   And then we treated God.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.880]   And you've all done it.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.720]   You do it every day.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.600]   And we embrace other values, other treasures, other desires
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.400]   that are so much more strong in our hearts than God is.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.920]   We've traded them.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.520]   And so we lack God's glory.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.920]   It's not our treasure.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.360]   We've just thrown it away.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.920]   And sin is anything you do in that process.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.280]   Anything that reflects that God is not your treasure is sin.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   So all have sinned and lack, throw away, exchange, demean, belittle, trample
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.360]   the infinite value of the glory of God.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:04.640]   Now, why does that call the righteousness of God into question
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.120]   when he passes over such sin?
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:18.200]   Because when God, as he does for all of his people, passes over, does not condemn
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:30.240]   sinners who have trampled his glory and demean his glory every single day of our lives,
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.160]   it looks as though he thinks that's no big deal.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.120]   To trample the glory of God is no big deal.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.240]   Be like a judge sitting at a bench who's got a murderer and a rapist in front of him.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.680]   He says, "We'll just let it go.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.800]   We'll just pass over the murder and the rape this time.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   We'll just pass over it."
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.200]   And everybody in the courtroom would say, "No way.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.240]   You can't do that and sit on that bench and be a just judge and say,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.680]   'You're just going to pass over this thing.'"
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.720]   And so God knows that he would be unrighteous.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:20.160]   He would be wrong, unjust if he treated his glory as though it were so worthless
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.440]   as to just pass over the trampling of his glory in his people.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.800]   And so he doesn't just pass over it.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:38.320]   He sends his son into the world to demonstrate his righteousness.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.360]   You see, what happened at the cross was the loudest statement imaginable.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.920]   If you understand Romans 3, 23 to 26, the loudest statement from heaven imaginable,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.040]   "I love my glory."
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   And in that very moment of upholding his glory, God made it possible to save sinners,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:21.600]   just and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   So, John 17, 24, "I want them to see me.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.920]   I want them to see me, risen, triumphant, glorious, all satisfying in my glory,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.760]   so that my glory will continue to be exalted forever and their joy would be full."
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.720]   And at the center, the cross, making that possible for sinners.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:53.160]   As God says, "I put my son forward to demonstrate my righteousness."
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.240]   My righteousness is my unwavering commitment always and everywhere
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   to uphold the infinite worth of my glory.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.400]   And if I am bent on saving sinners who have trampled my glory,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.680]   which I most certainly am, I will not do it in any way that calls my love for my glory into question.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.520]   I will do the absolutely unthinkable.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:33.600]   I will put my son on the gibbet and he will be tortured and he will bear my wrath to make plain.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:42.720]   I don't sweep God belittling sins under the rug of the universe when I save sinners.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.600]   Powerful.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.640]   Oh, get this understanding of God, his glory, and the nature of sin,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.600]   and the purpose of Christ's work on the cross for us.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.480]   These are absolutely essential.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.000]   That was John Piper here focused on Romans 3:23-26,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.880]   preaching on December 30th, 2009 at a Campus Crusade event in a message titled,
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.800]   "God's Passion for His Glory."

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.480]   I'm anxious that I don't do enough for God.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.800]   This is a statement that arrives every week in our inbox.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.280]   We hear it all the time, and we should.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:46.200]   If you read the Bible, even just the New Testament, you'll be met by 1,500 imperatives.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   1,500 things to do or not to.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.600]   That's a lot.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   It's overwhelming.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   So how do we overcome the anxiety that I never do enough for God?
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   That's the question for Pastor John next time on Friday.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.000]   We'll see you then.
