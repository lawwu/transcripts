[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   So it always takes a few minutes to go live. And for that, well,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.640]   since now like I use a monitor, so I'm like looking left and
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.960]   right. And I feel like a chipmunk when looking at the
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.040]   recording that like, why am I being so weird?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.080]   Chipmunk.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.560]   So I have to wait to hear an echo. That's when I know I'm
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.040]   live.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840]   Awesome. I like so I'll quickly share my screen, introduce the
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.880]   session, introduce Andrada and then we can get started. I just
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.960]   got exposed. I was looking at one of her kernels in
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   preparation. So that's what you saw. But welcome back, everyone.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.920]   Thanks for joining on a Friday. I'm super excited to be talking
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.280]   to Andrada today. Second time on the series. I'll quickly
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.920]   introduce her. First, I want to like glance over what are the
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.080]   series about what is chai time. And this is essentially CTDS 2.0
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.160]   So what is that all about?
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.600]   Adweights and biases. I'm I used to host a podcast called chai
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.240]   time data science in my previous life. Adweights and biases, I
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   get to continue doing that. And I wanted to do more to it. So
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.520]   now we dive into deeper techniques. We do solution
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.600]   walkthroughs where I essentially get to meet great people like
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560]   Andrada and understand how do they approach things. So that's
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   what we're doing today. Again. We're learning about EDA grand
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.800]   mastery. And here's the link for questions and answers. So I'll
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   post this again in the YouTube chart. If you head over to this
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   link, which I'll just show you. It should take you to this thread
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   and you all can post your questions here. And we'll keep
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280]   looking at it as we go through the session. YouTube chat is a
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.680]   little finicky. So this gets retained and I can keep an eye
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.160]   out. So please post your questions again on this link. A
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.800]   little more logistic stuff before I introduce Andrada.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.480]   Sorry about that. So I've just told you what CTDS 2.0 is about
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.120]   it's adding a depth to the interview series. It's learning
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.640]   more about techniques learning more about solutions. I'll also
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   have a few questions around Andrada's EDA journey, then we'll
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   understand how she approaches new data sets. And also how did
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.480]   she approach that for a complete kernel, one that she has already
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.000]   put out. So Andrada is top eight, top eight worldwide out
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.800]   of I think it's 5 million now Kagglers in the notebooks
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.760]   category, one of the top ranked notebooks, grandmasters. She's a
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.480]   data scientist at Endavo, one of the best EDA storytellers, one
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.920]   of the also best people to hear the stories from if you've
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.840]   watched her interview on chai time data science, it's one of
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160]   the most streamed ones for a reason just because she's such
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.000]   an amazing orator and amazing person to speak to. I also she's
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.160]   a mentor of mine and she's one of the reasons why I'm at
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.040]   WatsonBias is I had a conversation with her. So this
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   is also another literal reason why this session is happening.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.960]   Andrada, thanks again for joining me for the second time.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   No, thank you so much. And thank you for your kind words and for
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.080]   all that you do for this community. It's absolutely
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.040]   amazing. Your videos are still most of my watch. So thank you
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.360]   so much for for doing all this work. Thank you and for having
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.160]   I'm, I'm always excited to know more about your journey. I keep
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.920]   asking you online and offline. So going back to our previous
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.840]   interview, you were a master then since then you've become a
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.560]   Kaggle Grand Master. And in the previous interview, you shared
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.680]   that it wasn't the external motivating factor for you. It
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.600]   was just about creating these kernels like understanding the
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   process. Broadly, what is EDA to you? What does that stand for?
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.240]   For you?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.600]   So the first time I properly heard the word exploratory data
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   analysis was in my master's. And it was about statistics and
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.280]   findings, finding insights within the data, which is static.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.360]   So machine learning goes beyond that, and tries to predict
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.640]   something which gets a little bit more dynamic. However, EDA
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.880]   is something that you want to see in a particular point in
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.640]   time, in the past, or in the present, something that you you
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.400]   want to understand about some action that is happening there.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.920]   And you can for sure draw some conclusions and also maybe
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.240]   implement some some actions right on the spot by doing only
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.120]   EDA. So you don't have to get to the machine learning process. I
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.440]   saw a tweet, I actually saw a tweet a few, I think a few days
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   ago about something like who tweeted this. It was something
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   like, you don't have to. So the first step in doing machine
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.120]   learning is not doing machine learning. And it was something
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.960]   like by analyzing the data, you don't have to build neural
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   models and trade them for thousands of people and stuff
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   like that. You can do something just by analyzing and drawing
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.840]   some conclusions by looking at the data. So that's EDA. For me
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.520]   personally, EDA is more about the visual part, I would say. So
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.760]   everything not not necessarily graphs, but also the
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.840]   explanations that gets behind with all the schemas and
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   understanding it, like it's extremely visual. Yeah.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.720]   Sanyam Bhutani: So leaning into that, like what, according to
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.920]   you is like a good EDA, heads or tails creates this like hidden
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.440]   gems every single week, you get featured a lot of the times to
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.640]   you if you were to like, create a list of things that you know,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.240]   really stand out to you what broadly is good EDA.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:27.200]   Gita Gopinath: So good EDA and a good visualization for that
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.360]   matter is something that in structure, so talking about the
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   structure of it is extremely clean, and clear, and beautiful
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.040]   and visually appealing, I might add, and that kind of makes the
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.200]   user go in two different directions. It also so it clears
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:07:01.440]   stuff about their questions. And it also puts more it gives
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.920]   clarity, but also some sort of curiosity to go even further.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.040]   Because usually from a graph, you get some answers, which is
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.320]   amazing. But if it's a very good graph, and usually you it
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.400]   doesn't always turn out this way, but a very good visual, it
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.160]   also provides some even more questions. And you want to get
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.200]   even deeper into the data and get you curious and be like, Oh,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.800]   okay, what's next? I would like to know about this more and
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.200]   stuff like that. Yeah.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.720]   Sanyam Bhutani: Awesome. I, everyone has seen this like
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   extended effort that you put into it, you've given talks
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.920]   around it, you've created posts around it also create special
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   banners, you go the extra length of even looking at what's what
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.200]   gets printed in the console output, you also change the
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.240]   colors of that. How do you every single time? How do you find
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.320]   something new to try? Like, isn't it doesn't it get
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.440]   exhausted? I feel like, how do you like find those ideas?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.000]   Gabby Gonta - PhD, PhD: It gets very exhausting. But I feel like
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.960]   it's, and I'm saying this a lot in my in my talks. And also this
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.520]   is what I encourage a lot. People to do is try to bring
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.840]   something new every time. Doesn't matter how small it is.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.240]   And I have been doing Kaggle, I think, religiously for the past
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.840]   two, two years. So to do something two years is like
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.720]   religiously, it's quite a lot of time, I don't go to gym.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.880]   Religiously, I haven't been going, or I haven't been
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   getting very clean religiously for the past two years or stuff
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.920]   like this. So I think Kaggle has been the only thing that I have
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.040]   been doing regularly for two years straight. And it gets
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.560]   tiring, because at some point, you're like, how can I get this
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.840]   to the next level? But the answer is you always like if you
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.640]   have that faith in your in your head that you there's always
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   something better, then it gets your brain thinking and you're
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.520]   getting creative. If you're putting a stop and you're having
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.200]   like a limiting belief saying, Oh, no, like, this is all I can
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.720]   do, I can do even more, of course, you won't do more. So
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   the secret, I would say the secret sauce would be to be
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.920]   like, okay, what can I add? I'm sure there's something very
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.840]   interesting out there. Where can I find it? And then doing the
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.800]   research and getting curious, like said, banners. Okay, I saw
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.160]   the first time I saw Ben and I was like, Oh my god, the
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.760]   Farooly. I was like, Oh, she's amazing. This is a it's CSS.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   Okay, HTML in markdowns. That's amazing. I didn't know about
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.000]   that. And then you go stepping forward. Can I make this
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.520]   prettier? Can I add something a little something something to
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.400]   it? And it's the answer is yes. Yes. 100 times.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.680]   Sanyam Bhutani: People were getting the secret sauces that
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.640]   thought we had promised. It also goes back to your in the
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.400]   previous interview, you mentioned you have this like
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.200]   very visual, very artistic, artisty inclination, and you're
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.960]   always on the hunt for like, how to make things stand out. And it
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.680]   always comes across in your notebooks, kernels, older
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.760]   people call it kernels, older categories. So broadly
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.000]   speaking, how do you approach EDM, we can also use that as a
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.760]   transition to like looking at one of your kernels. So how do
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.880]   when you see a new data set? What comes to mind? How do you
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.080]   go about your EDM? I've seen your tweets, you first draw the
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.640]   plot literally and then go about it. So like how what's what's
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.680]   happening behind the scenes take us through that.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.360]   Okay, so can I can I share my screen with you?
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.240]   Okay, so everybody's seeing my screen. Okay.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.880]   I can see it. Yes. Okay. So I started with the Elon one where
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.720]   you like I think photos or Bitcoin to his eyes.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.760]   Do you want me to go through? And I was like, I'm already
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:30.120]   going. Oh, I know. I know what you're talking about. You are
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.000]   talking about the
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.760]   the notebook. Crypto cover.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.080]   Bitcoin slash Dogecoin one. Yes. Yeah. This one.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:49.840]   I could make it even better. This is this is this is always
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   ongoing process.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   I should have bought some some Dogecoin before this talk.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.360]   Okay, so I'm going to first introduce the topic a little
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.240]   bit. And then I'm going to walk you through the thing is it's
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:17.920]   not this is not really a recipe. Like usually when you want to
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.240]   get something done, you are like, okay, you it's like I
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.000]   don't know baking bread, you have the flour, certain amount
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.880]   of flour, you have salt, you have yeast and stuff like that
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.720]   you know, the exact temperature in the oven and so on. For EDA,
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.600]   or for at least my notebooks, usually it's not really a
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:48.520]   recipe is they start with a thought, a thought of, okay, I
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.920]   really want to do this particular thing. In this case,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:01.120]   so this is a notebook I did almost a year ago. It's been
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.640]   it's been like in a heartbeat, almost a year ago on a
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:12.040]   competition, the famous annual Kaggle survey, which so Kaggle
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.840]   usually puts out a survey usually during this time. And
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.680]   they interview all these data scientists that they have on
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:29.000]   Kaggle and learn about how old they are, what are these their
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.760]   background, what they know what they use, what they don't use
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:41.000]   and so on. So afterwards, during December, usually they have a
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.880]   competition, very interesting competition when they say, okay,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.640]   do an analysis on some sort of feature. So you we, we want you
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.000]   to understand some sort of particular aspect from data,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.080]   whatever aspect you want, put it out there, and then greatness
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.800]   happens. Last year, I was so two years ago, actually, I was too
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.160]   scared to participate. I was like, I don't have anything to
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.560]   and honestly, I was quite a beginner. So I was just
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.680]   discovering Seaborn and how to use it.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.120]   Sanyam Bhutani: Was this the McDonald's one where you like
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.200]   compared the McDonald's purchasing power across
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.640]   country?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   Exactly is the McDonald's. Which so it wasn't so I'm gonna
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.200]   actually maybe break a few myths. It's not original. I
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.760]   asked a friend. And this is something many, many people I
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.920]   feel like they're very afraid to do so ask, like ask people. And
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.920]   this friend of mine, very good friend of mine, I worked with
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.840]   her. Her name is Georgiana. So I worked with her at Avon before.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:57.400]   And she's very, very smart. It's she's extremely smart. And she
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   knows how to draw insights and how to look at data. I knew I
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.560]   was going to the right person. And I so the idea of my notebook.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   First, let's talk about the idea of my book was to analyze the
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.440]   cream, let's say of the data scientists and understand how
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   they became so good. And I had the struggle, really, I had to
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.160]   struggle because I was like, Okay, what can I look at? Can I
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.960]   look? I can look at their education. So yeah, probably
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.880]   grandmasters and usually in their interviews with you,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.400]   Sanyam, say they have some kind of doctorate, for example, but
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.840]   that would exclude all the people that didn't really want
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.280]   to go through the education, but to really put time and effort
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.560]   home. And then I wanted to look at years in programming. But
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.280]   this doesn't mean like, you can code once a week for five years
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.160]   and be like, average, but then you can code hardcore every day
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.920]   for 12 hours straight, no sleep, no, no food and stuff like that
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.960]   in one year, you're like a god. So I didn't, I didn't like that
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.880]   approach as well. So I kind of went to do with the more, say,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.200]   traditional aspect, which is money, really, how much money
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.680]   are you paid to do your to do your work? However, this was a
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.520]   problem, because, and this is the McDonald's stuff. And what I
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.680]   found out from from this friend of mine, I was like, how can I
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.320]   compare pay? Because $100 in, for example, Romania, maybe can
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.440]   buy much more stuff than $100 in us. And I'm telling you, it's,
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   it's buying much more, because it depends on the power of
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.680]   purchasing stuff. And I asked her and I was like, what should
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.760]   I use? And she was like, you can use like bread. What? Yeah, you
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.600]   can do bread or sugar or something like that. And you can
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.240]   compare like, how much sugar can these like units of sugar packs
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:20.680]   of sugar can $100 by in Romania versus us, India, Japan, and so
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.640]   on. It's like, okay, but can I make for fun for the foodies out
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.360]   there? And I found the McMeal combo. And I was like, okay, we
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.680]   can go to that. So what I did was I compared, for example,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.000]   this is a bar chart of all the units. So the majority of
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.520]   people. So the, the histogram was super, super skewed. So of
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.840]   course,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.200]   Sanyam Bhutani: Can we talk about how did you decide first
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.240]   of all, and how did you plot those French fries out there?
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.480]   And how did that thought come into your mind? Like, how does
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.120]   this magic happen in all of your tunnels? I really want to
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   understand that.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.840]   You're, you're really picking my brain, right? I'm trying to
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   find. I'm trying to find the process that somebody else
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:21.520]   could follow. So regardless of the main idea of the notebook,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.920]   what I usually try to do, and the idea here was, so I looked
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   at the notebooks that were made before. So in 2019 2018, I
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:42.840]   think, yeah. And I saw kind of the level. And I looked at first,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.000]   second, third, first, fifth, five places. And I was like,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.920]   okay, how can I top that? Because and this is amazing.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.600]   Actually, if you look at the winners in 2018, their notebooks
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.080]   are absolutely amazing. But if you look at the winners in
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.360]   2019, you can see they went a little bit extra. And then the
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.640]   winners in 2020, like, I thought I did a good job, I got third,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.240]   like the first and the second places, they're like, mind
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.680]   blow. It's, it's absolutely amazing what what what those
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.160]   those people did. So they went even further. And I'm super
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.600]   curious what 2021 is gonna bring. And this is the same like
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.320]   breaking records. It's the exact same thing. It's not bad to look
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.520]   at something and compare and want to do something much better,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:46.760]   because this is how evolution works. So seeing it's like, I
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.960]   can give you another example with running. So I think the
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.760]   record for running for like, hundreds of years was like, for
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.400]   for why running one mile, it was four minutes or something, four
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   or five minutes, don't quote me on that. But it was like a
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:13.560]   number. And then the record was broke by one second. And then
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.200]   that record was broken again, and again, and again, just
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.000]   because one person dared to broke that record. It's exactly
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.320]   the same here, you want to break the record of the last year,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.080]   because this is how you evolve. And you're making much, much,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.160]   much more progress. And this is how you want to break the record
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.720]   from past yourself. Also, like, and rather from last year,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.880]   hopefully, I broke the record on her, like, I'm working pretty
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   hard. I hope she's proud of me for breaking the record. Okay,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.560]   so the idea here was, how can I make these graphs, because I
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.520]   looked at what other people did, like, okay, I need to come up
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:02.200]   with some sort of very out of the box analysis. But how can I
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.360]   visually bring this better, like, to the next level, let's
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:16.400]   say. And I took each graph, like, each particular graph,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.760]   and said, Okay, I did the box plot. So here is just a simple,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.040]   very simple box block box plot in Seaborn. But I added so many
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.880]   features. And I was like, Okay, what can I do to make this even
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.320]   better? I can add French French fries. I can add I can add
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.960]   arrows, I can add information to the graph, I can change the
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:51.720]   color of these to match the phrase in the box. I can do
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.040]   stuff like that. And this is what I did. Yeah, sure.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.240]   Sanyam Bhutani: Can I ask a question around that, like, you
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.200]   always have this super vibrant, positive attitude, and you're
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.160]   always trying to improve also, I from just creating so much
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.640]   content, I've learned that the difference between great and
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.400]   like out of the world content is just those last minute
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.840]   optimization, the last mile is always the hardest, like it's
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.800]   almost done, you could call it done. And then you waste so much
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.360]   time in a way just doing one thing, and then something great
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.480]   comes out of it. So like, does it ever get frustrating for you?
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   Like, how do you continue? When let's say the plot is almost
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.760]   done? And like, you don't have the arrows, you're trying to
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.720]   make them you're trying to figure out what to do? Like, how
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.800]   do you fight that frustration, if at all?
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:49.760]   You know what you're saying? I think I know very well. I think
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.880]   so when you take a step back, and you look at it, and you're
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.960]   like, it looks, it looks good. It's never if you're a
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.480]   perfectionist is never gonna look like outstanding. It's
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.880]   never. But when you look at it, and you're like, it looks good.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.320]   It's like, it looks pretty good for now. However, during an
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.240]   analysis, so this notebook took one, one month, and a little bit
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:27.040]   to do each day kind of I did. So I worked on it. I go back. So I
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.560]   I make it I can't tell you how many times I changed the color
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.840]   scheme just because I was like, this doesn't work. Or how many
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:40.200]   times in one notebook, I like this graph is very ugly, I need
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.600]   to change it. Or the cover, I changed the cover. And now I
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.280]   don't like it, by the way. But I changed this cover so many
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.320]   times. I don't like it, though. I would change this 100%. But
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.520]   this, this is it. Just just just just constant improvement until
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.000]   the thing is, it's a deadline. So when the deadline is here,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   you can't do anything more. And you're like, Okay, I did the
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.760]   best that I could. It looks amazing. I am proud of myself.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.560]   I did all the best that I could. It looks amazing. But what I can
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.280]   tell you is because it looks it looks overwhelming. Now, right?
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.640]   I put these colors, I have a table here, it's all this
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.480]   methodology behind. First of all, mind you, it took me one
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.600]   month to make it. So it didn't take me five minutes or
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:44.560]   something. First of all, and second of all, so between very
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.320]   bad work, and average work, this is from from Tony Robbins, by
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   the way, so it's it's not me between. So poor work and
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:03.640]   mediocre work is a lot of hassle. Between average mediocre
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:09.200]   work and great work is a lot of hassle. Between great work and
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.440]   outstanding work is just like teeny tiny little bit of effort
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:14.800]   more.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.480]   I think it's the opposite that I think it takes like an insane
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.000]   effort to like not call it done. And then like keep at it like, I
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.560]   would just be happy that okay, now like the numbers are there
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.200]   like I'm done. I'm done. I can spend one month on
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.560]   better I give up.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:41.640]   I'm gonna go to the another notebook in a second. And in
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.160]   that notebook, first of all, the frustration was so so big. It
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   took me one week to do a visualization. And at the end
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.240]   of that week, I was like, I can't do this. How am I supposed
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:06.080]   to make a good, understandable notebook in one month, if in two
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.320]   months, really, if one research visualization takes me one week,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   like I can't possibly humbly. But what I'm trying to say is
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.760]   just adding little details and make it making it your own.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.560]   Throwing in your own personality, because it doesn't
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.080]   have to look like mine. I remember last year. So in this
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:37.760]   competition, I saw super great idea of somebody that used like
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.880]   in between text, it was a dialogue. It was like a theater
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.840]   piece that I was watching by through looking into his
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.000]   analysis. And I thought, Oh, wow, this idea is amazing.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.400]   Sometimes you don't have to come up with the visualization after
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.320]   you did the you have the data set and like, okay, this is the
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.160]   insight. Now, how do I because usually this is the case. So you
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.440]   have the insight, and then how do I represent it in a way that
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   I can share it with the people? However, there's not not always
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:22.800]   the case. Maybe you all already have the not really the insight,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.280]   but what you want to share. And then you can create the insights
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.800]   on base of it. And I'm gonna I'm gonna give you two examples. So
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.720]   for example, in this case, what I think made me one in this
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:44.680]   competition was the fact that I added a map. So it was a map.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:55.680]   Yeah, that's exactly. So I did it in. I can't remember the I
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.160]   can't remember, I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave it below in the
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.320]   comments. I can't remember the tool I used. But I use the tool
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   like very similar with Photoshop. And maybe now no, no,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.440]   no, no, no, no, this is too. Because the thing is, these are
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.360]   stamps, and I put them by hand one by one. So this was like a
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.800]   piece of paper. And I followed tutorials on YouTube on how to
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.240]   create this map. I knew when I started this competition, so
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.000]   before I knew what I want to analyze, before I knew the
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.440]   McDonald's scheme, before I knew anything, anything, anything,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.760]   really, I was like, I want to do a map. And this is because it's
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.400]   not like insane idea that I had during sleep or something. It
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.200]   was the fact that in summer last year, I was browsing through
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:01.320]   some deep learning courses. And I stumbled upon on Google on an
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:07.160]   analysis that was like a map of very cool gaming app, it looked
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:19.240]   like super awesome. And the guy that did the article split land
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.720]   piece into something like data analytics, machine learning,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.920]   deep learning, blah, blah, blah, neural networks, and so on. So
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.360]   it was like areas within the land. And I thought that was so
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:40.680]   awesome. Oh, my God, it looks great. I want to do that. So I
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.040]   knew the competition is going to start in December. And I was
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.320]   like, I am going to draw a map. So I already knew the theme
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.960]   before I started everything. And then I was like, okay, treasure
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.160]   hunt, gold, money. Hmm, I'm going to make a treasure hunt
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.640]   about the cream of the cream, the grandmasters, maybe I can
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.800]   spot them and be like, Okay, what do you do to be so great?
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:19.000]   So it was the theme and then the analysis. If you want, I can go
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.280]   even can I go further to the other notebook?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.800]   Sanyam Bhutani: Please, please. So this is this is really
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.480]   incredible. Like, this is what really I want to achieve through
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.960]   through just this is like really understanding the minds of great,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.920]   one of the best people of the field just like you, how do they
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.600]   like go about these things? And just trying to understand one
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.240]   step beyond the original interview series, please.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:54.120]   The thing is, I'm not, I like artsy stuff. And I like to make
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.240]   things beautiful. But in my brain, I am not that creative.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:05.600]   In a sense of I don't think I invent the wheel, and then I put
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.960]   it in the notebooks. I know, sometimes may might be looking
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.880]   like that. But I really am not. What I'm doing, and I'm trying
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.440]   to constantly do to stay humble and be like, Okay, I don't know
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.080]   everything is to research. Because when you're browsing
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.240]   Google, and trying to find people that are doing great
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.720]   visualization, for example, you're gonna find at some point,
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.040]   I know it's hard to find them. But you're gonna find at some
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.720]   point somebody that does something very great, and
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.440]   inspires you. You're like, Oh, I want to do that, too. Or you see
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.760]   a map. And you're like, Oh, I want to do that, too. Or this
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.160]   stuff, for example, and I don't know, putting icons, I feel like
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:59.240]   I saw this summer. Now it's been too long. I can't remember the
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.880]   source really. But I was like, Oh, you can put icons on graphs
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.200]   and make them fun. And I don't know, pirates hats and so on. So
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.240]   just seeking sticking to the theme, right? I am not doing
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.920]   anything out of the box, really. But just like treasure hunt,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.800]   pirates map, gold, and sticking to that, I managed to, to do
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.160]   this. And I'm super proud. I'm really super proud of this one.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:35.720]   However, I didn't win the first or second or I was the third.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.520]   And when I saw I was the third. Because in Kaggle, usually,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   people that have the most upvotes don't necessarily have
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.160]   like the most out of the box notebook. Usually super out of
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.080]   the box notebooks are very hidden. Yeah, I saw that a lot
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.600]   of times just because that person may be they aren't very
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.720]   active on Kaggle, for example, and they did something like
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.000]   super amazing, but because they aren't very active, they didn't
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.240]   get much traction. And the notebook kind of got others got
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.720]   stuck upon it and it was lost. So I haven't seen the first and
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.080]   the second place notebooks I haven't seen and I looked
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:32.600]   through many notebooks before the competition ended. And then
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.960]   I saw like, for me, the second notebook, the second second
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.880]   place notebook was what got me very, very intrigued. Because
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.000]   after doing this analysis, I was like, Okay, I have no idea what
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.800]   I can do even more with Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly. It's
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.440]   amazing Plotly, but I am not that I'm not that fond of it. I
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.360]   don't know why, personally, but I was like, I want to get even
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:11.120]   further a step further. So I stalked Schubert, which has been
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.200]   like, Oh my god, he's the reason I kind of got to the next level.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.120]   But not that easy, because I got scared. Okay, so this is his
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.840]   notebook, which is the second prize, the second prize in
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.960]   So besides the fact that it is super insightful, and it's, it's
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.640]   extremely, it gets extremely deep. And it's super
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.520]   interesting. Like if you have the time, just just you can
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.320]   check it out. Look at it, see what he's done. He's using a lot
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:50.600]   of Plotly in it. What I got amazed is about this graph,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:58.160]   where you can make it change. And I was like, what, what kind
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.240]   of source is this? Like, how can you do that? And then show
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.480]   hidden codes. Sometimes you get scared when you show the code.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.600]   And I saw HTML. And I'm like, Oh, what? And then I saw
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:19.120]   JavaScript. And I'm like, what the heck is this? And I close
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.880]   it. I was like, No, this is not for me.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:30.040]   Sanyam Bhutani: Is this why later you you learn D3.js
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.720]   recently?
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.120]   Yeah. Because I would have learned it much sooner. But I
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.800]   was like, Oh, this is too complicated for me. No. And
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.960]   this was a mistake. And I encourage everybody to not use
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.360]   that. Like if you want to do something and you it looks scary
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   and hard, just just do it. It's it's scary. And it looks hard
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.880]   just because you haven't done it before. And it looks like super
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:04.280]   foreign to you. Yeah, so fast forward, summer, August,
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:12.120]   beginning of August. I realized I kind of I was not following
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.120]   what I was preached. Being you want to add something new,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.800]   every time you want to learn something new, you want to put
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.640]   out something new in each notebook, at least the smallest
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.000]   thing. And I was like, Well, I haven't been doing much progress
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.440]   in the visualization part and is the stuff that makes me the most
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:43.240]   excited. And I went back to show where it's not. What is he
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:49.840]   using? Like, what is this style? Oh, horrible. And then I tweeted
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   him like I didn't tweet it. But I sent him a message. I was
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.920]   like, Hi, can you please explain to me what what what did you use
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:04.960]   and he was like D3. So this was my, my, the beginning of my D3
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.160]   journey. I asked him so he gave me some courses, interesting
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   courses on Udemy. I did a course. It was challenging. And
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.720]   I'm going to tell you so D3 is absolutely amazing. Like you can
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.360]   do spaceships with D3 really like
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.400]   I mean, I can't even bar float. So like I can't do spaces, but
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.360]   I was even people.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:38.680]   So it's absolutely amazing. However, for a data scientist,
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.160]   or at least I don't know, you have been interviewing many,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.440]   many people do data scientists from your knowledge, know
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.320]   JavaScript.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:54.120]   Like, I don't think so. Like, I don't think so maybe like if
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   they come from that background, maybe then, but most of them
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.800]   like the people into you haven't. So
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   okay.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:08.920]   So, JavaScript, in my opinion, is more of a, like hardcore
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.880]   programming, programming language. D3, unfortunately,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.360]   fortunately, because it's so granular. And this is why you
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.800]   can do spaceships really with it is that it uses JavaScript. So
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:31.120]   it uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS. HTML is for creating the
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.240]   place where you want your dashboard to go because you can
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.600]   do dashboards, you can do anything really with D3. Then
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.240]   you have CSS for the beautifying, visually appealing
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   stuff. And then the backend part, or like what goes to
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   create the structure of the of the visualization is
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   JavaScript, and the library that uses JavaScript, which is
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.080]   D3. So like we are using matplotlib for Python, you're
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.600]   using D3 with JavaScript.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:13.960]   You want to go into like, other stuff, like we are used with
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.120]   Jupyter Notebooks, for example, Kaggle Notebooks. I went
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:26.520]   through more hardcore environments, I forgot, I think
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:33.240]   it's called EDA. It doesn't matter. Like a visual studio.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:41.200]   And it was quite intense. But it got me to the next level. And
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.080]   this is what I want to show you, actually, because I already
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   have, I already have a link. So this is a graph I found that
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.320]   uses D3, for example, and all the code behind it is available.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.440]   So you can put your own data into it. And what's amazing is
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.720]   in you, you are looking at this, everything is done in D3. And
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:12.160]   you you're trying to think of some similarity with Seaborn or
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.720]   Plotly or matplotlib. And it doesn't have any similarity
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.600]   whatsoever. So these are hit songs, and how many days they
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.480]   stayed in leaderboard. The gray ones is kind of, oh, it dropped
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.680]   out of their 24 days, this one, the 47 and so on. Like, it's
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:38.520]   spiraling. This isn't even like, we are getting beyond pie chart
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.880]   to bar chart box plot stuff.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.320]   Beyond plotly, beyond just animated stuff, you can click.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.040]   Yeah, is is is interactive, you can transform into a bar chart.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.480]   It's absolutely amazing. And you have a button. And it moves.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.640]   And that animation.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:04.320]   So seamless. And I was like, I want to learn how to do that.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.960]   Because it's it is insane. And then you can transform into
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:15.720]   regular chart again. And, and I want to show you so if you
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:22.120]   click, it sends you to Spotify to the song. And again, I feel
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.400]   like, wow, that's amazing. So this is super interactive stuff.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:33.120]   And the person that did this did lots and lots more interactive,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.560]   interactive things. And what's insane is, again, you can insert
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.320]   somewhere down here, you have the data, which is just a simple
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.560]   CSV file with the artist, the name, when it premiered first
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.720]   appearance week and so on. So if you put a CSV here, like you can
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   just append the CSV here. With the same format, you can use
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.240]   this graph from scratch, like you don't have to do it from
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.640]   scratch, you can just use this work. Of course, just reference
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.680]   I cannot say this enough reference anybody you're cop,
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.080]   not copying, but using their work. It's, it's not a big deal.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.600]   Like everybody does that. But just reference. But these guys
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:31.560]   also. So after seeing this, I, I just couldn't go back to
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.600]   seaboard. I just couldn't. I was like, No, I need to understand.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:45.840]   And this. This is why I created this. So this competition ended
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.200]   yesterday. And it was a struggle for me until the end.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:57.040]   Especially in the moment that I realized that I am not going to
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.800]   finish this analysis as I wanted, just because the graphs
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.880]   were taking me too long. So this is COVID-19 impact on digital
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   learning. It was a very interesting competition where
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:15.920]   you could analyze how is really the state of the children in
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.600]   terms of engagement, and how are they learning? And how, what are
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.960]   their thoughts? And this was very close to my heart, of
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.440]   course, also, because my mother is also a teacher. So I talked
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.360]   with her a lot. So the research was done is was it was just a
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.640]   fact that, for example, this chart. So if you want to use
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   D3, you can safely copy this notebook, because it has
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.720]   everything you'll need, inclusively some tweaks that I
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.400]   had to do in order to make D3 work in a Kaggle environment.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.080]   But this graph, which I went back to a couple of times also,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:10.800]   it took a week. It doesn't look like it's nothing really, but
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.920]   the fact that I needed to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, how to
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:21.280]   put everything in practice, how to order them, some errors, how
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.040]   to work with a console within the web page. It's not hard, but
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.440]   it took a little bit of time. So if you want to learn D3, you
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:39.120]   want to prepare with some sort of some sort of patience. And
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.960]   then I went into some hardcore stuff. And I'm just going to
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.760]   show you some some things that you can really do. For example,
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.640]   a bar chart, just a simple bar chart can go into something very
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:55.760]   interactive, where you can see, like numbers, I added also a
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.800]   line here, this is referenced. So I saw somebody use that. Then
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.400]   I went back because I saw like this cool gradient, apparently
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.320]   it's super easy to add the cool gradients to the bar chart. And
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.040]   I added this too. Again, you can add this interactivity to any
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:20.360]   any plot. And this one, for example, so this one, I can
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:28.000]   actually show you the original because the wheel.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.560]   Sanyam Bhutani: And sorry to interrupt someone asked, is this
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.360]   pre recorded? No, it's not. We're live. We're literally
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.240]   live. We'll get to the Q&A afterwards. So please keep the
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.000]   questions coming. This is not Chai Time Data Science division
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.080]   where I record and premiere them. It's live.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.560]   Okay, so great for the excitement. And this is, I
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.240]   remember what I want to say. So for this particular analysis, I
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:05.560]   didn't come up with the like, I first saw the I first knew what
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.840]   I wanted to do, like, I want to make this wheel. How can I
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:15.680]   incorporate this visualization into what I'm working now. So
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.960]   it wasn't the insight. Again, it wasn't the insight. And then the
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:24.360]   graph, it was first the graph and then they site. And I saw I
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:32.440]   remember I came into observable. And I saw this wheel, which it,
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.040]   again, it blew my mind, because it's something like it's not
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.880]   really a pie chart. So this is equal area radial matrix of LGBT
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:50.080]   rights in us. So this is a wheel that you can you can move and I
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:57.960]   feel like, oh, okay. And so for each state, here, they are
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.720]   split into Southwest, Northwest, Midwest, and so on. So it's, I
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.000]   feel like it's pretty easy to read this will you have if
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.240]   marriage, for example, is like, fully allowed or partially
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   hospital visits, adoption, employment, housing. So for
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:26.320]   these people, if these, let's say, facilities, or not really
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.960]   facilities, but these areas, let's say that all people have
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:39.760]   rights to if they have also maximum right or partially, you
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.360]   have where the data is. So when spent, not clear is when it's
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.480]   great. And then you can also analyze. So the amazing thing is
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:56.840]   you can analyze full time between these characteristics,
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:03.280]   let's call them and between states in the same time. Mind
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.720]   you, in Matt, not leaving my opinion, what you would have
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.040]   needed to do instead of just one cohesive, very, very informative
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:24.880]   wheel was to do pie charts, 50 pie charts, or 2467 pie charts,
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:32.480]   and then in each pie chart to put like the state. It's not
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.360]   that intuitive. And it's not that easy to understand. And the
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:46.600]   idea is to analyze the graph and draw insights. So this will I
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.040]   was like, I need to do this. It's absolutely insane. It took
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:49:00.760]   me one to fully implement. But I did it. Nevertheless, I did it.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:07.920]   So this is the origin of the wheel. And then I went in and
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.160]   went further. For example, this is another another graph that I
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:17.240]   am very, very proud of, which took another week on school
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.280]   timeline. So this is the activity. And then this is the
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.360]   engagement of the children in top state. So you can see here.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.440]   So this also is in D3, right? Everything is in D3. So for
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.400]   this analysis, everything I did was in D3 just to get the hands
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.200]   on because you can do the courses and I highly recommend
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.960]   the courses actually. So do the courses just to have a baseline.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:48.480]   But after you did the courses, you want to have a pretty good
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.960]   hands on and to start digging and researching and
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.200]   understanding for yourself, learn by doing, it's the best
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:01.600]   way to learn, really. So this is a stream chart. This is called a
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.400]   stream chart. And again, I saw this and I was like, Oh, I have
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.840]   to do this. Because it fascinated me the fact that you
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:16.000]   can. So this is the time axis. You can see here where the
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.480]   pandemic started in US when the school started to shut down
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:24.280]   really, between March 16 and 24. I hope you can see it quite
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:30.160]   clearly. And then here you have the summer break. And then
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.720]   again, the next school year. And the fact that you can move
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:41.440]   this line. And you can see here, so you can see on the left, the
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.200]   the date, and then to the right, the state, which is here, New
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.400]   York, here is Massachusetts, Illinois, Connecticut, and so
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:56.880]   on. And then how many loads page loads for 1000 students. And,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.760]   again, you can compare in time and see, okay, so they all had
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:07.400]   around the same trend. You can't say, Oh, New York dropped
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.960]   suddenly in summer, of course, it drops suddenly in summer,
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:14.320]   it's it's summer, nobody's studying in summer. And then,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:20.440]   but then it didn't quite get back to what the it was. So but
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.840]   you can also compare between the states and say, Oh, so New York
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.240]   had the most engagement compared to, for example, California,
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.200]   which had a very low engagement. So again, this is a graph that
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   has a lot of dimensions, I would call them I don't know if it's
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.680]   very correct to say that. But you can get a lot of information
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.720]   by looking at just one thing, instead of having like multiple
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.280]   bar, like line charts that go all over the place. And you need
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.720]   to look at the axis to see if it's a difference between them.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:04.280]   Okay, and if you are curious, you can go ahead and look into
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:13.320]   it more, more, more deeply. What I saw many people observing one
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.520]   of my tweets, and I saw you had to sign them. From this D3
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.240]   course, what I learned, and I was amazed was that the guy
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:31.360]   said, whenever you're starting to make a very deeply
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:39.760]   complicated visualization, you want to have a notebook, or just
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.480]   take a piece of paper. And after you have the visual, so for
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.280]   example, I don't know here, after I had, I knew I wanted to
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:57.880]   do this hive map of USA. And then here, I wanted to put a bar
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.480]   chart just because I knew, for example, I think this is
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Wisconsin here, you have an engagement. However, you want to
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.960]   look here and see that Wisconsin has only three districts. So
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.000]   maybe it's not that representative. However,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.400]   Connecticut, you can look at Connecticut, and you know, it's
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:22.760]   extremely representative. So I just drew on a piece of paper,
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.880]   okay, this is where my map I want to go, this is the title I
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.000]   want to be here is the bar chart, and so on. So I made them
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:36.520]   in a sense that it's very easy afterwards to look at the paper,
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:42.760]   and then create it, having it visually next to you, in the
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.320]   Visual Studio. And this is again, this is not not my idea.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:53.080]   I found out about it in that D3 course I took. And it's amazing.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.240]   It's amazing. Yeah.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.520]   Sanyam Bhutani: It's like from what I understand, there are
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   the like these steps like people like me give up at just like
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.120]   getting the plot done and like we give up there. But like once
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.480]   you have the plots ready, then you can go another step,
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.400]   stylize them, create a color theme. Last time we talked about
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.200]   the Morty themes, all those things, you can do that. Then
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   you get to the code, you also comment it out, put nice
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.520]   comments in there, make make sure it's up to quality. Then
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.000]   you go a step further where you like add arrows, add
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.520]   annotations to the graph themselves. Beyond that, this
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.320]   really is the like, I think the highest step any Kaggle has
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.760]   shown us where you like, learn an absolute new framework that I
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.280]   don't think any data scientist uses. I'm sure a few do but like
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.600]   not on Kaggle and create these like visualizations that are
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.480]   totally interactive, totally different. Like everything about
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.400]   this, even this graph, like I'm sure you put in a lot of thought
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.040]   into understanding the background is like a gray
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.520]   background, not a black one. I would assume a black would
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.040]   stand out. I'm sure you would have experimented at some time.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.240]   Picking the right shade of green. I'm assuming a brighter
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.000]   green is what I would have gone with but like that might be just
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.400]   too annoying. So you tune it a bit. Then like in the graph, the
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.680]   blue color gradient.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.560]   On the butchers.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.600]   Yeah, yeah, like all of these thoughts are like these. You add
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.520]   another thing to the storytelling, you add another
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.120]   thing, you add another thing. And like, it's all of these
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.520]   incremental steps that I'm just learning about now.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:33.880]   Yes. And it's a, in my opinion, so you don't have to be a
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.120]   visualization fanatic to do this. You can apply this in all
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.400]   your work, because this is how models are created. Or this is
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.840]   how more complex analytics are created, and so on. It's just
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.880]   building upon what you did and building and building and trying
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:56:00.800]   to, for me at this point, I felt like I already did. I already
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:07.680]   discovered as much as I could have discovered using the usual
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:13.520]   mainstream libraries. And I just wanted to get a step further. So
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.840]   this took me one month and a half to do the entire analysis
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:25.160]   and lots of nerves. However, I realized yesterday, when I kind
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:30.800]   of sprinted, sprinted in the last few hours of the
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.240]   competition. This was made yesterday, for example. I
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.640]   realized when I shut down, and I was like, okay, this is it. I
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:46.280]   can't do more. It's, it's what I could do in the time I had. I
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.680]   don't think I can go back to like, peacefully do a bar chart
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.480]   in Matplotlib and be like, very good, Andrata. You did it. So I
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.520]   might add some sort of D3, because now I'm starting to like
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.920]   it. But because I'm starting to understand it. But it wasn't
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.760]   like that in the beginning. Like, as I told you, it was so
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.560]   frustrating.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:16.680]   Sanyam Bhutani: Yeah, it's like Kaggle really brings out the
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.120]   best version of everyone, not just because there's a leader,
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.160]   but but like anyone who's, especially in this like
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.440]   notebooks, you're like creating a story. So like anyone who's
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.400]   there, like it's time to always like increase, increment their
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.840]   approaches. And there's there's a reason you have the rank of
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.200]   top 10 in the world. It's not just a random number, right? It
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.920]   comes through all of this effort and like the community really
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.080]   sees it through in your kernel. And we all like, like, I can I
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.840]   can probably relate to this graph as well. I'm sure I would
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.480]   like just take the whitest color and put the title using that.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.640]   But this I know is like a little slight off white, if I may. I'm
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.920]   like getting the paint down in my house. That's why I'm like
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:04.000]   very much into what colors are but like, it's totally like it
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.560]   totally comes through the attention to detail in all of
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.640]   these kernels. So
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:14.840]   question everything. Question everything. Should we go into
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:21.320]   the questions? Should I? Okay, I'm gonna stop sharing then.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:28.160]   Let me share my screen and get to them. I'll scroll to the top
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:34.200]   and start from there. Um, I think this has been answered.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.120]   So let's keep that. How do you come up with your analysis?
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.600]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:50.040]   Um, as I said, so it's not second nature. You if you're
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:55.520]   have been inspired by something, then you can implement that and
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.120]   start building from there. Yeah.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:04.240]   Schubert is there in the YouTube chat. Shout out to you. We've
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.720]   just been looking at your stuff a little while ago.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.320]   Oh, is Schubert here? Schubert is here?
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.520]   Yes, yes.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:16.960]   I gave you a big like, again, thank you so much. Like, the
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:21.160]   fact that he implemented this race, why I kind of got to the
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.320]   next level. So go follow him. He's an absolutely amazing
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.400]   human being. Thank you so much.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:33.120]   I said I feel seen in this comment. David, he's a good
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.160]   friend. He thinks that young or aspiring data scientists don't
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:41.360]   understand the value of SQL. Can you elaborate on your experience
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.400]   with SQL? And are those important in your opinion?
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.400]   So I haven't been, but this is depending on your work. I have
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:58.760]   seen. So there are many debates. So if you are on Twitter, and
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:04.000]   you follow many data scientists, you will see that there's a lot
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.360]   of debate on what is the best approach to machine learning? Or
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.560]   what is the best approach to do something? Or is it Kaggle
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.720]   worth it? The answer is everything is customizable to
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:23.560]   you. And if something works for somebody else, it doesn't mean
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.480]   it has to work for you. In my opinion. I worked so I worked
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:36.600]   with SQL in my previous job. Now I'm not working with it anymore.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.000]   Just because the job doesn't require we are working with
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.920]   unstructured data, we are working with files. So it really
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   depends SQL, in my opinion, I think it's not used, for example,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.560]   with images, or text or something like that. It's used in
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:00.320]   databases. So if you are, and I can ask you, I can answer you
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.560]   with this. If you are a data scientist, and you don't want to
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.480]   wait for other people, data engineers or other things, or
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.640]   usually wait for a page to load to put in the, you know, the
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.200]   parameters to extract the file, you want to go straight to the
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.160]   database, because this is how you automate stuff, or this is
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.040]   how you make things go much faster. And on your own terms,
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.000]   because you're doing this, I can do it now. I don't need anybody
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.480]   else do it for me, then you would need SQL. But if your
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.640]   friends wants to do deep learning, for example, it
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:49.480]   depends if he they are, if he's she's using images or stuff. So,
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.400]   but I would recommend for everybody to know a little bit
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.880]   of SQL, because you don't know when you'll need it. Just just a
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.080]   little bit. It's not that hard to to learn, really.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.640]   Sanyam Bhutani: If you're writing the queries in pandas
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.960]   using df.query, like you're low an okay amount, I think that's
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   that's enough to get around. Okay, coming ahead. What is a
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.360]   simple way for like, let's extend this question. What's a
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.880]   simple way for anyone in machine learning to get into parallel
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.640]   competitions or become a grandmaster?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.760]   Sphurti Kachare: Oh, a grandmaster in competitions, I
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:38.600]   cannot pronounce because I am not. I'm not qualified in any
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.360]   way to answer that. But I can tell you a grandmaster in
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:51.760]   general. The So first of all, the purpose shouldn't be to
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   become a grandmaster. And I've seen this. And this applies, in
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:06.000]   my opinion, to all areas of our lives. If the purpose is to get
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.760]   a lot of money, be a grandmaster, be, I don't know. The
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.240]   purpose when the purpose is very, very community focused.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.840]   And this is not like I swear to you, this is not bullshitting or
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.240]   something. But when you have contribution in mind, when you
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.560]   are thinking, how can I add to my community? How can I help
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.920]   somebody else understand data visualization or this model in
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.280]   machine learning? Or how can they get a job or something,
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.120]   anything? Like when you're thinking of how can I contribute
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.280]   and add more value, not destroy, add more value to the community
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:57.360]   or to this I am working on. All the benefits will follow. I 100%
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.600]   guarantee you. So thinking, okay, I need to do 20 notebooks,
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:12.160]   and I have to ask 100 people each day to upvote my notebooks,
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.000]   you're going to become a grandmaster. But if you have,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.560]   eventually you're going to become really a grandmaster. But
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.680]   if you're having contribution in mind and adding value, that's
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:32.760]   the moment when you're gonna have all these benefits that
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:39.840]   we're gonna come. So really, if you're passionate about
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.240]   competitions, just this is how you get into Kaggle. You go
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.600]   ahead, open a competition. It sounds nice. And then you start
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.000]   understanding, learning, look through the notebooks, other
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.360]   notebooks, and try to create something yourself. If you want
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.520]   to create a great notebooks, just go ahead and do some
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.240]   analytics on something you're very passionate about. Maybe
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.200]   you're passionate about sports, you want to make an analysis on
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.120]   sports. And if the analysis is very, very good, it's going to
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:18.840]   get traction at some point. Now, not always. So you want to also
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.960]   be very resilient. Yeah.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:25.120]   Sanyam Bhutani: I remember in like, even in a previous
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.240]   interview, you mentioned you were happy by the fact that you
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.840]   didn't initially get a good traction and you were like quite
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.880]   focused on the process. Just to echo on that, like, I, I would
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.400]   also quite get frustrated, especially like with, like,
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.160]   it's, it's a stupid thing to compare to. So I apologize. But
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.000]   like with the podcast, it's like a little number that gets thrown
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.400]   in your face. But this is the number of people that watched
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:52.120]   it. But like, for anything in that matter, that's like similar
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   to that number of upvotes, how many views you get on a blog,
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.840]   number of views on a video, like if you if you optimize for that,
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.920]   it's not going to be fun. Like I was there to like, just learn
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.800]   about your journey or learn the journey about like all of these
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.160]   grandmasters. And reminding me about that, like eventually got
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.000]   it, the podcast to like, the top podcast in the Kaggle community,
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.320]   like that was never the goal, it did get to it in every day, like
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.760]   it becomes very frustrating if you're always staring at that.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.280]   Because these the instant gratification that we had, I
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.680]   would be a hypocrite to say that I, at some point was like, why
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.840]   am I getting upvotes? Like, I'm so proud of this notebook, I
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.760]   worked so much. I don't know if you saw the D3 notebook that I
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:42.400]   created, that I worked my ass off, it has like 80 upvotes in
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.760]   comparison to I don't know, another other notebooks that I
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.720]   didn't work as much and they have like 500 upvotes. Now, I'm
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.840]   not going to question anything. This is the algorithm, maybe
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.760]   people didn't didn't see the value, it doesn't matter. But
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.120]   like you said, if it has five views, of course, it doesn't
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.960]   have 1000s or 100s or something. But these five views were people
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.920]   that you helped in some sort of way. And who says, helping five
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.320]   people is a bad thing. Like really. So a constant reminder
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.520]   would be very, very good. Yeah.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.360]   Sanyam Bhutani: We also have Laura Fink in the YouTube chat.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.960]   Thanks for joining us, Laura.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:35.480]   Oh, oh, Laura, Laura Fink. Yes. Oh, hello, Laura. Okay.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.720]   Everyone wants to learn your secrets. Yeah. Everyone wants to
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.960]   learn your secrets. No, I want to know Laura's secrets. Like
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.000]   she's absolutely amazing. Okay.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:56.200]   I can skip these two because we've answered those. Anjum,
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.960]   also Kaggle master, every Kaggler for the first time is
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.800]   showing up. Do you ever find the notebook format creatively
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.280]   restrictive? If you had a blank canvas, what would be your
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.200]   chosen format?
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:14.760]   Oh, this is a very good question. So the notebook
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.600]   format in Kaggle or in general?
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.440]   I think they're talking about Kaggle, or maybe just Jupyter
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.080]   notebooks. Both are the same thing in a way, mostly.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:33.680]   So in my opinion, I am inevitably, inevitably thinking
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:41.920]   of D3. And the fact that, for example, the way I inputted the
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:51.280]   code for D3 was very, very, it was very restrictive and very
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.120]   hard. And for example, for people that didn't, that never
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:02.480]   coded in JavaScript, if you when you call a variable, it's not x
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.760]   equals to 10. It's var x equals 10, or const x equals 10, and so
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.640]   on. And if you forget that thing before, in Visual Studio works.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.880]   And on my local machine, it worked. But whenever I put it
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.080]   into Kaggle, I would get an error and the entire notebook
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.080]   would shut off. And then you need to rerun everything. And
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.000]   then other other things that I had to do little tweaks that
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.840]   really my partner helped me because I have no, I have no
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.240]   technical background. And he helped me a lot because I, I
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:45.600]   couldn't get Kaggle to work. In this case, I think observable,
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.320]   for example, so if everybody wants to use D3, you can go on
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.080]   observable. And they have is exactly the same format of
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.640]   notebooks, which with markdowns and codes and so on. But you can
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.760]   implement D3 very easily. And then you have a designated part
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:08.960]   where the chart updates. You don't even have to refresh it
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.480]   updates automatically every time you put some some sort of code.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.920]   So I think for example, if Kaggle, and maybe I can actually
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.080]   start a discussion about this, if Kaggle could implement, if
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.000]   Kaggle could make it easier, I have no idea how and if they are
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.080]   technically restricted in some ways. But if they could
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:40.280]   implement an easier way for us to use D3 in the notebooks, I
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:46.920]   think many more people would start learning it. And I think
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.160]   there are three notebooks in total three or four notebooks in
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.800]   total that use D3 at the moment to Kaggle. It was one for
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.200]   beginners, I forgot who I am very sorry. It was one from
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:04.480]   Schubert, and it's this one from from me. And the fact that it's
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   so hard to make it work. It's it's a showstopper. It's not
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.480]   this is not a showstopper. It's it's a barrier in creating it.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.440]   Yeah. Hmm. It's a very good question. Very good question.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.040]   Okay.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.760]   Sanyam Bhutani: We have like a one one or two more questions.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.960]   Maybe we can come back to them afterwards. Do you want to go
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.200]   through the last experimental bit we had discussed?
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.320]   The NFL? Or? Okay. So
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.400]   Sanyam Bhutani: just to give everyone some context, I asked
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.800]   and Radha to like pick a competition she's not looked at
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.480]   all at before. And like walk us through how she would for the
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.600]   first few minutes look at the data and how would she approach
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.320]   EDO like this just the data broadly.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:10.520]   Okay. This competition started eight days ago, I was still in
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.440]   the other one. And I was still struggling with the other one.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.400]   So I had, I knew when it appeared, I wanted to take
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.440]   advantage of it. Because most of the competitions have leader
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.600]   board and they're like normal competitions that people very,
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.320]   very smart, smart, smart people participating. But because I am
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.600]   super passionate about the DA, although this competition is is
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.640]   not really about data analytics and visualization is it's much
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:45.320]   more deeper, but it is still some sort of analytics. It has
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.720]   some sort of analytics, analytics aspect to it. And I
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.560]   was like, Okay, after I'm done with this competition, I really
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:59.320]   want to start in the NFL one. So I haven't looked at it. I
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:07.520]   watched a video, I'm not gonna lie about what NFL is because I
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.800]   am from Romania, which is a country in Europe, we have
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:19.600]   soccer. And I don't know how people play soccer either. I am
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.840]   very I like basketball. I know some stuff about basketball,
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.120]   but about NFL, I have no clue. So I watched a video, but it
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.520]   didn't shed any light on what it's still very, very weird to
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:41.320]   me. But it's so why I chose it. Let's let's start with that one.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:48.000]   And maybe this is how would be your day to day recipe. So I
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   started it, I chose it because first of all, I want a change of
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.080]   theme. I did for one month and a half education, it was super
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.840]   amazing. But I want to change it. So this is why data science
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.840]   is so amazing. You can change the field, the playing field. No
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.920]   pun intended. To whatever subject you'd like. So sports,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.000]   I've never done I think, a notebook on sports. And again, I
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.320]   want to take advantage that this is kind of an analytics
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.960]   competition. And I want to learn about American football. So
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:34.800]   here I am. Good. First thing I would do, and I usually do is
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:42.720]   read this many times. Like three, four times to understand
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:50.880]   what's the competition about. Then I go to evaluation and
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.440]   understand what's the like, what's the requirement. So
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.000]   specialty metric, I understand the special teams are some
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.840]   players that come in the game some, maybe, maybe a fan of
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:11.480]   American football fan can explain better in the chat, I
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.880]   need to research more. But I would understand what are the
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.320]   requirements. And then so before doing anything else, I would
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.960]   jump. And so this is my approach. But any other person
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.320]   might do it differently. So don't take me by word, but this
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.520]   is what I do. I jump straight into the data. And I just
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.200]   browse. Okay, so first of all, mental note, it's CSVs. So it's
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.800]   not images, not audio file files, not NumPy files, or
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.240]   something like that. So it's just plain CSV files, we have
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.160]   multiple files, we have years, so it's tracking on multiple
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.680]   years, we have like time series, maybe something like that. We
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.840]   have the place the players, the games, PFF scouting data, I have
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:13.000]   no idea what what PFF means, I need to come back to this. And
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.320]   then I just here I just browse, because in this part, I get in
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.840]   more depth. So this is quite a pretty big description of the
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.120]   data for a competition. In this part, I usually get when I am
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.760]   opening a Jupyter, Kaggle notebook, and I'm starting to
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.480]   look at the data. So here I'm not browsing. Afterwards, what I
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.360]   do is research. In my case, the research is pretty lame, because
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.200]   at the moment, I first need to understand what so first of all,
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.440]   how, what are the rules of American football? How do you
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.880]   play American football? And then what are the rules of the
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.040]   championship? What are the themes? I understand there are
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:09.080]   like 32 teams divided in 16 American and
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.560]   Sanyam Bhutani: I have no idea. I have no idea.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.600]   Mariana Pereira-Vandermeyer: So yeah, so the the idea, the
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.200]   reasoning behind it, because in my opinion, in this competition,
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.360]   from from what I can say, from the 10 minute video I watched
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.800]   today, about American football is the fact that so it's the way
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:38.240]   you play in one game, but it's also how the games fold. And it
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.520]   might be like in a chess game, for example, when sometimes you
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:50.240]   sacrifice pieces in order to win. So in my opinion, how this
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.680]   competition might need to be approached is not a winning game
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.360]   by game basis, necessarily, this is why I need to understand how
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:07.240]   they are folding, but winning in the overall picture. Because
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.520]   basketball, if I remember correctly, if you if you lose
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.920]   your your your out, so but here, I, as I understand is it's not
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.200]   the same rules. So understanding the rules, understanding data,
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.960]   and then I would open a Jupyter Notebook. When I would have some
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.440]   free time, I love to make the cover. So first of all, I
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.640]   usually make the cover.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.880]   Sanyam Bhutani: So that comes first?
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.240]   Mariana Pereira-Vandermeyer: Yeah. Because I like I want to
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:43.080]   get into the I want to make a commitment. Making a cover is a
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.160]   commitment. It means the notebook is going to come out.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:52.360]   Like, no matter how hard it is. Okay, so yeah, I usually at the
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.720]   beginning make the cover just to be everything pretty and to have
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.080]   peace of mind. And then I would start looking at the data. And
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   then going back and forth with the research data research data
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.120]   research until I I understand something. What I will for sure
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.040]   do in this case, because I have no idea what the make of the
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:18.000]   book is, I don't know if I told you is to make a lot of scammers.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.960]   Because, again, I'm a very visual person. And I feel like
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.560]   most people understand information when it's visual.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:35.920]   Not written, visual. If it's a video with sounds and noises and
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:42.600]   stuff, it's much better. But I am I am yet to go there. But
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:48.040]   scammers, in my opinion, are the best way. And oh, I usually say
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.360]   this, I think I said this too many times. But if you want to
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:58.000]   make a great notebook, you want to make it for others. Like you
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   would teach others to make it. Yeah. Going back to the
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.440]   contribution also that you need to have in mind. Because when
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:13.920]   you are thinking, how can I teach this? How can I? How can I
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.080]   explain this to another person has no idea what the make of
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.360]   football is, you are going to get in so much depth within your
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.960]   brain, that you're going to understand it very, very clearly.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:32.080]   But if you're doing this only to yourself, you're gonna you're
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:38.440]   gonna step over a few, a few, a few steps in between, that might
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:44.200]   need to link the entire, the entire image. Now, this would be
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:53.360]   like the first three, four days in the analysis. What I would do
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.200]   in the first three, four days. Yeah. Beyond that, I have no
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.160]   idea. Because I haven't seen the data. And I don't know what
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.520]   American football is. Yeah.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.840]   Sanyam Bhutani: I'm like, just just curious on that. So like,
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.200]   people like me don't even know all of the graphs. But like,
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.840]   let's say you've come up with a schema and then you're like,
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:22.040]   figuring out how to show it. How do you like go about into the
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.200]   details of thinking, oh, this is this is more of a V plot. Let's
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.400]   say this is more of a histogram. How do you like decide on all of
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:31.720]   that?
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.920]   I didn't get the question. So if I have a histogram,
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.840]   how do you decide to present the data once you like have things
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.000]   in place? And once you have like a story in your mind?
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:58.520]   I think so. The question is, how do I decide what graph to use
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:07.960]   when I have the insight in mind? Okay. I think this comes up,
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.320]   it's gonna be such a lame answer. But I think this comes
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:22.280]   with experience, unfortunately. Meaning that you're gonna do it
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.200]   actually, I can give a recipe. So you have some sort of
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:34.400]   insight. For example, let's say you have, let's say you have two
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:40.120]   teams, team A and team B. And you have the scores. Yeah. Okay.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.320]   So the score for team A and the score for team B for 10 years.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:53.560]   So you have a few dimensions, you have the team, you have the
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.200]   the ears. So it's through time, and you have to score three
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.440]   things. How can I go about it? And you can go about it through
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.760]   trial and error. So you already have the data, you already kind
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.840]   of pre processed it, you bought it to a nice, small table that
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.520]   you want to plot now. A first idea, very quickly to mind would
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   be to create a bar chart, like a bar chart, which you have here
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:27.360]   every year, here is the score. And then here you have team A
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.640]   and team B. And you can see how the scores in different years
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:41.400]   look. Okay. But does it really showcases the difference? Does
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:48.840]   it really accurately shows and makes you think about that
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:55.360]   difference? Because if you look at the bars, one bar can be
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.400]   like, this is a bar and this is the other, you need to compute
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:04.560]   the difference between them. And also, you want to look at the
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:11.880]   score. So maybe team B had an evolution through time. But the
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.400]   difference between team B and team A got bigger and bigger
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.040]   through time. How do you you know, these are all these little
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:26.200]   details. What I would recommend now that I've seen many methods
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.640]   to plot and this is where experience comes really you want
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.000]   to research as much as possible and see as many examples of
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.880]   plots as possible is to, for example, show a dot a dot plot
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:47.280]   where can I share my screen just one second please? Because I
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:57.280]   feel like me explaining this. It's a funny attempt. Like this,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.960]   because this is why I thought about it. So you can see the
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:09.760]   time and you can see the difference much more clear. And
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.560]   you can also compare for example, if if I have multiple
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.040]   other groups, you can compare but you can see of course, so
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.920]   this is lower than this, because you have here the axis from zero
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.720]   to 4.5. Okay, but you can also observe the differences. And the
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.160]   color also helps you see that the green, like, let's say team
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:40.480]   A was much lower in score all the time than team B, but oh,
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.600]   here they were so close. It was such a tight game and so on. So
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   this one, in my opinion, in this case, it's a much more
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.440]   informative graph than a bar chart. But for you in order to
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:00.560]   use this, you must know about it. And this is, you know, where
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.360]   you want to make your research and just explore. Yeah.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.760]   Sanyam Bhutani: I think we have time for one question. But again,
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.160]   thanks. Thanks for that, like detailed walkthrough. I'm sure.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.400]   Like, I'll go back and try to copy that. I don't foresee any
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.400]   success. But like, I'll try that. I'm sure others will find
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.200]   it more useful. I think we can squeeze in one question. So
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:30.320]   here's a controversial one. David asked, D3 is more suited
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.080]   for data journalists and not data analytics in business
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.160]   settings. What you really want is like something practical that
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.800]   can get things done, right? I mean, like, maybe I can answer
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.040]   for us to that point. Kaggle is also like really experimental,
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.880]   like you don't you don't see that data every day at work.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.200]   Like it's, it's much more simpler than that most of the
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.400]   times unless you're like in a research environment. And like
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.360]   the reason you're trying all of this stuff is because Kaggle is
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.520]   a playground. So you get to try those things. So it's useful in
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:01.920]   that way.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.040]   You're, you're right. And I would like to like to add upon
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:18.120]   this. So I see how D3 is a complete waste of time for
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.040]   people that are doing competitions, for example, like
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.840]   hardcore competitions. D3 is a complete waste of time. And I
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.760]   wouldn't recommend to anybody, any, any, anybody to do D3.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   Because what again, going back to the example with the bar
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:41.280]   chart, you don't have to make this awesome grade with bubbles
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.480]   and annotations and so on. If you can do quickly seaborne on
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.080]   matplotlib bar chart where you show the differences and you as
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.120]   a data scientist, understand everything and you're like, Oh,
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   I know what I need to do. You can go ahead and skip and
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:00.080]   because I remember I saw a notebook from a grandmaster.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.440]   He's like, top 10 in competitions, like super
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:10.360]   hardcore. And his notebook was so insightful. But the
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.480]   visualizations were like the most quickest matplotlib things
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.520]   you can you can think of, but he doesn't need something more.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:24.800]   Because he needs just the insights. What I love about data
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.560]   visualization, for me is the fact that I would like to share
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:35.840]   it, for example, with my mother, or with a co worker, or just in
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:43.320]   general, to be able to be like, like they, like he said, like a
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:52.240]   journal, like a notebook, an analysis. So I know that D3 for
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:58.080]   people in competitions is not going to be very helpful. But
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.000]   for people that are doing analytical competitions, or for
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.480]   people that are just like said, experimenting and doing some
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.160]   playground on Kaggle. And really, the fact that I created
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:15.120]   a notebook of D3 on Kaggle is to show to be another resource for
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:23.320]   people to learn, because I didn't have to get into that
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:30.640]   much trouble to integrate, you know, but it's a process. So I
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:36.880]   I understand their opinion, but I feel like it depends the case.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.560]   Again, it's super customized, customizable. Yeah.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.840]   Sanyam Bhutani: Content also by definition is open source. So
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.400]   like now that you've created it, who knows, like maybe everyone
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.080]   starts doing it, and then you'd like again need to level up. And
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:54.080]   that's, that's how Kaggle and pretty much YouTube also it's
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.960]   like some YouTuber does something crazy. And now like
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:00.160]   everyone's doing it. So like, now you need to do something
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.720]   even more.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:06.600]   Dina Irani: Exactly. And this is what I said about doing
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:10.760]   outstanding work and kind of doing better than the ones that
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:16.440]   did last year. Because this is how we create good stuff. It's
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:22.000]   it's it's the fact that we innovate, let's say, and this is
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.680]   why we're humans with a brain. I feel like
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.160]   Sanyam Bhutani: This has been an awesome interview walkthrough of
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.120]   understanding your greatness. I'd point the audience to your
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:40.160]   Twitter profile @anradaolteano with W I always get confused by
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.240]   that it's there in the YouTube chat also in the top resource of
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.400]   the forums who follow her there. You can always find her
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.320]   notebooks as soon as they come out or other. I think there was
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.840]   a GIF I recently saw about the yes this one for the D3 plot
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.760]   that you were working on. Yeah. And you can also follow her on
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.600]   Kaggle or find a profile there just by searching her name.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.640]   You'll see more areas getting golden really soon and these
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.400]   numbers going up. So check out her profile. And it's always
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.880]   always a great learning experience for me to talk to you
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.400]   and I'm sure for the community as well. So thanks for sharing
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.120]   these insights.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.680]   Thank you so much for having me. Thank you so much. And thank
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.320]   you for everybody to everybody who joined and for the
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   questions. Thank you so much. Thank you.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.680]   Thanks, everyone.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.680]   Good bye.
