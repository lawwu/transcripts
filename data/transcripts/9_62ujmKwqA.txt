[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.400]   the one and only Ido Portal on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.040]   Ido Portal is credited with being the world expert
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.560]   in all things movement,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.200]   and the person who coined the term movement culture,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   which is the gathering in and around movement practices.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   Ido and his colleagues have essentially combined
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.920]   all the different forms of movement that exist out there
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.580]   and expanded upon them to create patterns of movement
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.400]   that utilize all aspects of the nervous system
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.820]   and that can be incorporated not just into sport
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.220]   and dance, et cetera, but also into daily life.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.620]   Needless to say, it was a very special experience for me
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.000]   to get direct movement instruction
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.560]   from the luminary of movement, Ido Portal.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.040]   I became not hyper-conscious of every movement,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.820]   but certainly far more aware of my posture
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.240]   in the various movements that I make
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.620]   and has led me to start to incorporate
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.620]   some of those same movement practices into my daily routine.
