[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Now, the diabolical thing about the flu virus
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.500]   is that just like the diabolical thing about the cold virus,
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.980]   you start shedding virus, that is you are contagious,
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.540]   about 24 hours prior to the onset of first symptoms for you.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.780]   So that means that you can be a flu viral vector
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.380]   even when you aren't having symptoms.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.080]   That's just the unfortunate aspect of these viruses.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.700]   They're very clever, they don't have brains,
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.780]   but these viruses have adapted to propagate
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.260]   from host to host to host.
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.980]   They have a drive to continue to stay alive
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.900]   and to infect more hosts.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.420]   So even though they don't have a brain,
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.740]   they have a sort of, let's call it viral intelligence.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.260]   And as I've said several times now,
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.980]   if you are still exhibiting symptoms of the colder flu,
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.740]   you are contagious.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.660]   However, with respect to the flu,
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.540]   you are most contagious during the three days
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.260]   when you feel the absolute worst,
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.180]   when your fever is at its worst,
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.740]   when you are coughing and sneezing, headache, all of that,
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.340]   when that is at its peak,
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.900]   That is when you are most contagious.
