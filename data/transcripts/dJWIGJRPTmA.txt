[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   stocks are super easy to get into. Stock investing takes very little time other than the
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.280]   minor hassle of opening a brokerage account, which today is like as simple as downloading an app and
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.880]   pressing a few buttons on your phone and connecting your bank account. I mean, that's really it. But
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.960]   once you've opened a brokerage account, you can buy and sell stocks in a few seconds and boom,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.200]   you're done. Real estate though, it seems like it could be expensive, right? There are greater
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.920]   barriers to entry, I think, for real estate investing because it tends to be a more capital
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.280]   intensive asset class. You can't just open an app and buy rental properties for $10,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.720]   although there are some funds and some modern crowdfunding platforms that do allow you to do
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.360]   that. I think of real estate investing as more entrepreneurial than buying equities and buying
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.160]   stock. In addition to those things that, you know, credit, income, down payment, you also need this
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.280]   expertise that can be a real investment of time that is probably not needed, especially for like
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.480]   index fund or other stock investing approaches here.
