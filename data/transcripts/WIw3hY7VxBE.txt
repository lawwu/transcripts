[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.800]   that portion of scripture we have read at the beginning, namely in the book of the Acts
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.600]   of the Apostles in the second chapter, in the thirty-second verse, the thirty-second
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   verse in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.160]   This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.960]   This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.600]   Now I take that particular text, but I do not propose to confine myself to it.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.320]   I want to consider with you rather the sermon that the Apostle Peter preached on the day
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.800]   of Pentecost in Jerusalem, the day when the Holy Ghost descended upon the early infant
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.640]   Christian church.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.760]   Now I call your attention to this sermon because it is most vital and important that we should
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760]   do so.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.440]   Here is the first sermon that was ever really preached under the auspices of the Christian
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.980]   church as we know her.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.480]   Until this point there had been these followers of the Lord Jesus Christ and these special
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   people known as disciples or apostles, but it was on this day of Pentecost that the church
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.920]   as such came really into being as we know her.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.200]   And here are these men filled with the Holy Spirit of God speaking and preaching in the
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   name of and for and on behalf of the Christian church.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   Very well, I say that this is the most important and the most vital sermon.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   Why?
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.360]   Well, because for this reason, apart from any other, that it does give us therefore
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.040]   an account of what the message of the Christian church really is.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.760]   It tells us what Christianity is about.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.040]   Here is the very first statement, the first declaration made by the church which has just
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.400]   been constituted and brought into being.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.800]   And I need scarcely say that one of my main motives and reasons for calling your attention
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.120]   to this is the terrible confusion at the present time as to what Christianity really is and
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.080]   as to what the message of the Christian church really is.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.320]   We are living in an age, my friends, when everything is characterized by confusion.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.860]   There is confusion in every realm.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.320]   Confusion in the political realm, confusion in the international realm, confusion in the
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   world and realm of industry, confusion in art, confusion everywhere.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.680]   The old canons have been dismissed and derided and everything seems to be new.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.200]   But alas, this confusion has come even into the realm of the Christian church and the
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.800]   Christian message.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   And books are being written and published which seem to be casting doubt upon everything
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.600]   that has been said in the past and offering us a new statement of what Christianity really
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.840]   is and what it means.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.640]   And that is why I say there is so much confusion at the present time.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.120]   I am not blaming the common people for being confused.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.640]   How can there be anything but confusion with all these contradictory vices and statements?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   But what adds, perhaps, most of all to the confusion is this, that the old terms are
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.960]   still being used.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.600]   There are many people today talking about resurrection, talking about Easter day, but
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.320]   who don't mean what has always been meant by that.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.880]   They tell us so.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   They tell us that these old terms need to be what they call demythologized, that in
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.880]   the past people have believed in these things as literal facts, but that we today can no
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   longer possibly accept them as such.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.360]   So they use the old terms but evacuate of their meaning and put into them an entirely
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.440]   new and novel meaning.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.520]   And the result of all this, I say, is unutterable and indescribable confusion.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.360]   That is why I make bold to say that nothing is more important for us this evening, Easter
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:51.960]   Sunday evening, than to know what the message of the Church and the message of Christianity
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.600]   really is.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.840]   And what can we do better than go back to the origin?
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.200]   What authority have we got apart from this?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.080]   This is how it began.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.760]   Here we are told in this picture, in this second chapter, of a hundred and twenty people.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   That's all the Church consisted of, a hundred and twenty people who were together in an
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.000]   upper room.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.600]   And the Holy Ghost comes upon them, and Peter preaches this sermon, and at the end three
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   thousand are added to the company.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   Well, that's the very thing we want to know, isn't it?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.360]   We are being told by these people that their great concern is that the message of Christianity
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.800]   should get over to the people.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.640]   They are troubled, they say, by the fact that the messes are outside the Church and that
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.440]   the Church is becoming a dwindling community.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.240]   And everybody is concerned about this one question.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.640]   How can we get the message of Christianity over to the people?
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   What would they give if they could only add three thousand to the Church as the result
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.360]   of one sermon in one night?
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.800]   Well, that's what happened.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.680]   And that is why I am arguing that nothing is more important or urgent for us than to
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   discover exactly what was done, what was said, how it happened, there back on the day of
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   Pentecost.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.180]   And it's all here quite clearly before us.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.760]   That is what makes this sermon such an important one.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.840]   Let me notice, therefore, and call your attention in the first place to certain things that
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.520]   we do not find here.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.960]   The whole tendency today is to start with the men in the street, the modern men, the
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.880]   modern men of whom we are told that he is now of age, he has grown up, the modern secular
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   men.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   That's where they start.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.800]   They say, "It's no use, the Church, going on preaching these old truths.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   The people are not interested.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.320]   They've got a new mentality.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.400]   We are confronted by a new age.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.760]   We are confronted now by people who are living in the atomic age.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.640]   It's the age of the space men.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.080]   It's the age when people are going upright into the heavens and sending their rockets
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.680]   there and doing orbits around the moon and so on."
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.280]   Here's the starting point, they say.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.120]   We must start with this modern secular man who has got scientific knowledge and learning
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.120]   and training, and we must be concerned about having a message that will please him and
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.320]   that won't offend him, and that will appeal to his knowledge and to his background and
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.280]   to his present position.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.720]   That's the modern attitude, I think you'll agree.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.320]   And therefore he is to be approached carefully, and he is to be allowed to speak and to state
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.720]   his point of view and to put forward his ideas about God and about religion, so we have discussions,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.160]   dialogues.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.440]   And this is the modern idea of getting the Gospel over to the world and winning men and
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440]   women.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.640]   I say I find nothing like that here.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   I don't find any concern on the part of the Apostle Peter to say things that are going
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.240]   to please his audience.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.520]   I find rather boldness.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.160]   I find him attacking them.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   I find him reprimanding them.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:23.440]   I find him speaking with assurance, with confidence, and with an absolute certainty.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.400]   His position is not that if he carefully prepares his case and his argument and, remembering
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.000]   the outlook and the knowledge and the mentality of his audience, so puts it to them that he
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.920]   will win them and appeal to them and attract them, that all will be well.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.320]   It's not that at all.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.480]   Indeed it's almost the exact opposite.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   The Apostle Peter relied for the efficacy of his message, not upon his ability to conform
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.240]   to his audience, but upon this Holy Ghost that had entered into him.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.640]   That's his power.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.240]   That's the basis of his assurance.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   What else do we notice?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:13.720]   We notice at once the extraordinary content of this message.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.600]   And here is again something which is very striking when you put it by the side of what
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   is being done at the present time.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:30.040]   For as I am reminding you, what is happening at the present time is that men are speculating,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.840]   speculating about God.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.560]   You see, they say this modern man with his knowledge, his scientific knowledge, with
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   all the space research and so on, the modern man cannot possibly believe in a God up there
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.120]   or a God out there.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:51.160]   No, no, you must talk to him about a God who is depth, a God who is the ground and the
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   basis of all life, the God that is within.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.400]   You don't talk about heights and up and out, but down deep, depth.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.800]   And indeed, the modern man cannot possibly believe we are told in a personal God.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:12.720]   Well, very well then, don't talk about a personal God, but talk about that which is
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.440]   the basis and the foundation of all things, the heart of the universe which is love.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:31.960]   Now that, I suggest to you, is men speculating, men trying to come to some idea about God,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:39.800]   which will tell you with his scientific discoveries and knowledge and with his type of thinking.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.760]   But you see, there is nothing like that in the sermon of the apostle Peter.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.720]   To start with, Peter couldn't do that, he wasn't a philosopher.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.000]   If you went to the apostle Peter and said, "Don't talk of God up there or out there,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.320]   but God is depth," Peter wouldn't know what you were talking about.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.440]   You have to be a trained philosopher to understand such language.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.160]   And the apostle wasn't a trained philosopher, he was a fisherman.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.860]   He couldn't use the clever language of the schools.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.320]   He was just an ordinary man, a working man, but he's the preacher, the first preacher
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.280]   in the hospices of the Christian church.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:22.720]   And of course he doesn't do that because he knows this full well, that all that had
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.000]   already been tried and had already failed completely.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.040]   Another great early preacher was the apostle Paul, who was a very great philosopher and
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.680]   a very great man, and who had studied in the schools and could meet the intellectuals on
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.000]   their own level and on their own ground.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   And he puts it like this, "The world by wisdom knew not God, it tried to find him."
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.840]   There he is, you see, preaching in Athens to the Stoics and the Epicureans, and he knew
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.720]   that these men had been trying to search for the absolute, the ultimate, the being behind
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   all being.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.400]   They were philosophers, they were men who lived in the country of Plato, Socrates, and
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   Aristotle, and they spent their time in trying to find this unknown God.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.920]   And they were trying to do so by speculating and by philosophy.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.560]   But they failed completely.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.960]   And they were no nearer at the end than they were at the beginning, so the apostle says,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.160]   "The world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.040]   So obviously they're not going to go on just doing that.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.720]   All that has been tried with the greatest brains and it's come to nothing.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   So they're not going to do that.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   Well, what is it then?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.480]   Well, because the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.800]   preaching to save them that believed.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   That's what we've got here.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.040]   And of course our Lord himself had said exactly the same thing.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.320]   No man hath seen God at any time, and no man can see God.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   Why?
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   Well, because God is the eternal.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   God is infinite.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   God is absolute.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:11.280]   And no man, no mind of man, is big enough to comprehend the incomprehensible God by
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   definition.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.440]   That's why all the philosophers have failed.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   And yet we are being told that that is what we've got to do now.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.080]   We've got to think of God as depth, God as the ground of all being.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.280]   That's pure philosophy and speculation.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.120]   The thing that had already been tried and had failed before Christ ever came into this
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:39.000]   world, no man hath seen God at any time.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.280]   It was because men can never arrive at an idea of God that God sent his Son into the
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.460]   world.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.320]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.920]   The only begotten that is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.200]   It's because men can never arrive at an adequate conception of God that the incarnation took
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.280]   place that God sent his Son into the world to give the revelation.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.520]   Very well.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.920]   That's what we find in the sermon of the Apostle Peter.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.680]   So here, you see, in this first sermon, we don't find Peter speculating about the being
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.880]   and the nature of the being of God and saying, "Don't think of him in terms of height or
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   out, depth, ground of all being."
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.280]   No, no, I say Peter couldn't possibly have done that.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   Well, what does he do?
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.040]   Well, now then, this is the thing I want to hold before you.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.920]   This is the Christian message.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.000]   This is the thing that the Christian church is supposed to preach and which, by the grace
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.300]   of God, I'm going to preach to you tonight.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.440]   Because I have not composed a sermon, I'm going to preach Peter's sermon.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   What is it?
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   Well, listen.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:55.600]   Far from being uncertain speculation and wondering and doubting whether God is personal at all
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.640]   or not, and just some great idea.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.480]   No, no, what you've got here is proclamation, proclamation of truth.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.840]   It's a most remarkable sermon, this, had you ever noticed that, I wonder.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:18.560]   It's a curious sermon in which you get an intermingling of facts and reports concerning
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.360]   facts and quotations from the Old Testament and exposition of them.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Did you notice it?
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.440]   That is the sermon.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.960]   He starts off by saying, "Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.080]   said to them, 'You men of Judea and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.520]   unto you and hearken to my words.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.960]   These are not drunken as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day, but this
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.080]   is that which is spoken by the prophet John.'"
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.080]   Now, what's it mean?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.080]   It means this.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:51.440]   "Here were these men, these disciples and the others with them in the upper room.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.840]   And suddenly the Holy Ghost had come upon them and they started speaking with other
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.240]   tongues.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.840]   People were there in Jerusalem from every country of the then known world and they spoke
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.440]   different languages and their astonishment was due to this.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.280]   They say they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, 'Behold, are not all
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   these which speak Galileans?
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.120]   And how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born, Parthians, Medelimites,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   etc.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.880]   They said, 'We do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.'
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.400]   And they said, 'What is this?'
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.800]   They were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, 'What meaneth this?'
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.560]   Others mocking said, 'These men are full of new wine.'"
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.160]   Very well, that's Peter's starting point.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.960]   "Listen," he said, "this fact that has amazed you, what is it?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   What's the explanation?"
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.660]   And he then begins to answer his own question.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.680]   So what he does, you see, he begins by stating a fact and he adds other facts to it and then
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.480]   he goes back to the Old Testament and shows the relevance of the Old Testament to the
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   New.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.480]   In other words, Peter, instead of speculating about the nature and the being of God, expounds
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.580]   the Old Testament and reports the facts with which you and I are familiar in the pages
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.160]   of the four Gospels and the early chapters of the book of the Acts.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.200]   That's what he does, and he blends them all together.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.160]   And he does it, as I say, with an extraordinary boldness.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   He does it in a most convicting manner.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   What's he saying?
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.800]   Well, what he said to them was this.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.720]   Let me try and summarize it in this manner.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.160]   He said, "I'm not here to speculate with you about the being of God.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.840]   I've come here to tell you about what God has revealed concerning himself."
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.980]   In other words, you see, Peter's sermon is based on the Old Testament and the New.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:57.600]   It is an extract of the essential message of the Old Testament, which he quotes from
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.960]   the Psalms and the Prophets, and it's all the same everywhere, the Old Testament and
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   the New.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.400]   It's a perfect blending of the two, and a showing of the relevance of the one to the
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.840]   other and how each one supports and verifies the other.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.840]   What is the message?
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:25.520]   It is this. "God, the everlasting, inscrutable, eternal God, has revealed himself to man."
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:34.680]   He's done so through the patriarchs, to whom he spoke and manifested himself.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.960]   He did so in a very special manner to a man called Moses.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.080]   He'd done it previously to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, and then very especially
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   to this man called Moses.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.560]   God not only did that, he created a nation for himself in order that he might speak to
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   the world.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.840]   And he chose certain men out of this nation and he gave them revelations of himself.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   They didn't arrive at a notion of God which was consistent with their age and generation
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.720]   and in conformity with their learning and their science or the absence of it.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   No, no.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.240]   God spake.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.720]   And they reported what God said.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:25.080]   And God gave to them a revelation of himself, his being, his character, his might, his glory,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:32.400]   how he created the world, his holiness, his justice, his righteousness and his love.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.520]   God, whom man can never arrive at, began to talk to men about himself.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   But he didn't stop at that.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:48.440]   He not only gave a revelation of himself, he gave a revelation also concerning men.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.740]   Here was this one nation amongst all the other nations, and yet this nation had a unique
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.080]   understanding of life.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.040]   None of the others had it.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.440]   Their philosophers speculated and tried to understand God and man and life, and they
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   were baffled.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.600]   There was only one nation that had the explanation of men and his history.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:15.040]   It was the Jews, to whom had been given these oracles of God, these messages from God.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.720]   It wasn't that they were cleverer than others.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   They were not.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.640]   The Jews don't compare for intellectual brilliance with the Greeks, yet it was the
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.980]   Jews who had the message, not the Greeks.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.920]   God gave it.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:33.240]   It was not speculation and philosophy.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.480]   And God told them about men and his troubles and explained to them that it was all due
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:49.800]   to men's rebellion against God, to men falling into sin and becoming alienated from God.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   And further he revealed to them that God condemned men for this rebellion and this sin.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.480]   That's the great message of the Old Testament, God making men perfect in his own image, men
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.840]   rebelling and falling, God's wrath upon his sin, and God threatening judgment and
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   perdition.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   It's there in the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.280]   But thank God there was something else.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.680]   And that is that God revealed that though men had thus fallen and had forfeited every
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.080]   claim upon God and his goodness and his love, that nevertheless he, God, had a purpose and
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.800]   a plan of redemption and of salvation.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.120]   God revealed this.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.200]   He revealed it in the Garden of Eden, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.420]   head."
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.920]   And he went on revealing it.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.760]   God formed this nation of the Jews.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.760]   He said to Abraham, "Look here.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.240]   When Abraham was ninety-nine and his wife Sarah was over ninety, God said to them, 'You
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   are going to have a son, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.'
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.680]   It seemed monstrous and ridiculously impossible.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.600]   Modern science says it is impossible.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.280]   It would involve a miracle.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.360]   That's what God said.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.800]   That is what God did.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   The seed of the woman he had promised in the Garden of Eden, he repeats to Abraham, is
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.880]   going to come out of the loins of Abraham.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.960]   And to Abraham and Sarah there was born a son called Isaac."
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.520]   And on and on and on the line goes.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.680]   The Old Testament is just this.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:42.800]   It is a constant repetition of this great announcement that God is going to send a mighty
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:51.720]   deliverer who is going to rescue and redeem all mankind from the condemnation and the
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.400]   wrath of God and the power of the devil and evil and sin.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   God is going to do it.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   That is what he promises right through the Old Testament.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.880]   And he takes steps to bring it to pass.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   Therefore you get all the history of the Old Testament, the history of the Jews.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.600]   God is preparing for the coming of this great and mighty deliverer who is going to come
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.840]   out from amongst the Jews.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.200]   He is going to be a son of Abraham.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.720]   He is going to be a son of David.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.520]   And in addition to those acts you have got the prophecies.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.120]   You have got the prophecies concerning him in the book of Psalms.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.400]   Peter quotes the 16th Psalm.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.480]   He quotes the 110th Psalm.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.800]   He quotes the prophet Joel and other prophets.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:43.400]   All these prophets are in reality just repeating this one message that God is going to send
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   a mighty deliverer.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.800]   The day is coming when someone will appear who will take upon himself the problem of
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.120]   fallen men and solve it and reconcile men to God and be the means of bringing great
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.360]   blessings upon him.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.800]   That is the message of the Old Testament, says Peter.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   It is the great message of the Psalms and the prophets, of the whole of the Old Testament
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.000]   scriptures.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.800]   And then he goes on to say this remarkable thing.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.480]   He has come.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.240]   He has arrived.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.640]   The prophecies have been fulfilled.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.760]   That is precisely his message.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.320]   Look back, he says, there are your prophets teaching.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.600]   Read your Psalms.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   They are prophetic.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.880]   They are all speaking about someone who is going to come and do this great act of deliverance,
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   a redeemer, a mediator.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.320]   Listen, says Peter.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.200]   He has arrived.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.920]   He has actually come.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.160]   God has visited and has redeemed his people.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.040]   The hope of Israel, the thing to which they look forward, has actually materialised.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.400]   It has already taken place.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.360]   Now that is the message of the apostle Peter and the day of Pentecost, as it is the great
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.200]   message of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.920]   God has done this thing that he had been promising throughout the running centuries.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.240]   The day of salvation has arrived.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.200]   How did they know this?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   On what grounds can Peter speak with this great confidence and assurance and boldness?
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   And the simple answer to that question is the resurrection.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.000]   What did they preach in the early church?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.840]   Speculation about God?
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   Not up there, not out there.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   Death.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   No, no.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.040]   This Jesus, he talks about him.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   Did you notice it?
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.280]   The men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.200]   Jesus of Nazareth, the men approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.360]   which God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.840]   There is an epitome of the whole of your gospel stories.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.160]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.480]   by wicked hands, have crucified and slain, whom God hath raised up, having loosed the
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   pains of death.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.800]   That's what he preached.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:31.640]   Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:41.800]   This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all, he says, are witnesses.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.720]   What did he preach?
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:53.840]   He preached the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ as a fact, in a physical sense.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.660]   He didn't merely say that the memory of Jesus went lingering on.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.640]   He didn't merely say that in some mystical, almost spiritualistic manner, they were making
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.000]   contact with the spirit of Jesus that was still going on in another realm.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.400]   No, no.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.440]   He says we are witnesses of the fact that he has literally risen from the grave.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.160]   In the body.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.220]   That the grave was empty when some of our own company went and visited it.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:26.000]   We found the clothes, but not the body.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.640]   This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   Listen, they said, he has risen from the grave in the body.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.780]   He appeared to us in a room.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.360]   We met him at the seashore.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.560]   He, Jesus himself, physically has risen.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.080]   Well now, here is the crucial question, isn't it?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.040]   Can we expect anybody to believe that today?
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.680]   We are living in a scientific age.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.520]   We are living in a secular age.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.920]   We are living in an age when we have sent men up into space.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.320]   They haven't seen any God there.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.000]   They haven't seen any heaven there.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.360]   We are living in an age which doesn't believe in miracles because science says miracles
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   are impossible.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.400]   Is it possible that men today will believe in a literal physical resurrection?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.440]   Don't we need to demythologize this and to say, of course he didn't rise in the body.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.360]   They were primitive people and they believed that kind of semi-miraculous nonsense.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.440]   We know.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.040]   Is that your position, my friend?
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.360]   Well if it is, this is all I've got to say to you.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.640]   That you're in an utterly inconsistent position.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.840]   Why do you believe in Jesus at all?
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.640]   You say, I believe in the teaching of Jesus.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   That's what's needed.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.240]   I believe in the Sermon on the Mount and his ethical emphasis.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.760]   That's what we say is needed today.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.600]   But of course I don't believe in these miracles.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   I don't believe in his virgin birth.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.920]   I don't believe in miracles.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.600]   I don't believe that he literally rose in the body.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.000]   But why do you believe anything about him?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.760]   Where have you got your knowledge from?
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.960]   What do you know about the teaching of Jesus Christ?
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   Where do you get your knowledge?
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.280]   Where does it come from?
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.780]   You know the answer to that question?
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.960]   It is from these apostles.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.520]   You know nothing at all about Jesus Christ except what these apostles have told you.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:28.560]   And these are the men who say that they were literal witnesses to his physical resurrection.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:34.660]   If you don't believe him about the resurrection, why do you believe them about anything?
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.400]   In the end, you see, you either accept all that they've said or you accept none.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.080]   You are in an utterly inconsistent position.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.000]   These men tell us we are witnesses of his resurrection.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.360]   And they were, of course.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.640]   The fact of the matter was that these men didn't believe in him as the Son of God until
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.720]   he displayed himself to them after the resurrection.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.520]   It was the resurrection that convinced these men as to who he was.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   They're honest enough to tell us that.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.960]   They tell us in the gospels for which they're responsible that when they saw him taken and
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.440]   crucified and died, they began to say we were all wrong.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.120]   We thought he was the Messiah, but he can't be.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.840]   He wouldn't die if he was Messiah.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.360]   And they were absolutely hopeless.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.400]   And one day Peter, in utter disconsolation, turned to the others and said, "I'm going
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   to fish.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.920]   I can't stand it any longer.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.200]   We thought, 'Oh, how wrong we've been.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.360]   Let's go and fish and do something.'"
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.400]   And then they suddenly saw him on the seashore in the morning.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.520]   And they knew that it was he.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.480]   And their faith was revived and their hope was rekindled.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.680]   It was the resurrection that convinced Peter himself and all the rest that this is the
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   Son of God.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   He says, "We are witnesses.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.600]   If not, I wouldn't be here.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.160]   We wouldn't be standing before you."
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.720]   They are the preachers of the fact of the resurrection.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.320]   Well then, why did they preach it?
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.480]   Well, he tells us all about it.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:16.520]   It is the resurrection that finally proves that he is this long-expected Messiah.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.400]   You see, Peter does that in this way.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.360]   He takes that sixteenth Psalm.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:26.000]   Listen, he says, "David speaketh concerning him.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.600]   I foresaw the Lord always before my face.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.040]   He is on my right hand that I should not be moved.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.640]   Therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:40.840]   Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.480]   Thou wilt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.240]   Thou hast made known to me the ways of life.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.800]   Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.080]   Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you about the Patriarch David, who wrote those
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.360]   words in the sixteenth Psalm.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.120]   He is both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.560]   Therefore, he says, it is obvious that David was not writing about himself.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:18.520]   David did die and David did get buried in a grave and his soul did see corruption and
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.120]   his body corrupted in a grave.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.720]   His sepulcher is still there.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   What does it mean?
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.360]   He says, therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.880]   out of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:40.600]   on his throne, he seeing this before, speak of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:46.800]   was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.720]   David wasn't writing about himself, said Peter.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:58.440]   He was prophesying about this great Deliverer, this great Messiah that was to come.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.160]   And you know, said Peter, he's come.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.440]   This Jesus hath God raised up.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:11.960]   Thou wilt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.320]   This is the only one who is not to see corruption.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   Not men.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.160]   All men are corrupt and all men are sinful.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.800]   That's why they die and see corruption, even David, even Abraham, all the patriarchs, they've
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.920]   all seen corruption.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.960]   There's only one, says the whole of the Old Testament, who's never going to see corruption.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.200]   Though he dies, he'll never see corruption.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   Who is he?
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.840]   The Holy One of God.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.900]   He has arrived, says Peter.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:49.980]   We are witnesses of the fact that he was nailed to a tree on Calvary's hill.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.880]   We heard him crying, "It is finished."
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.280]   We heard him saying, "Into thy hands I commit my spirit."
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.920]   We saw him gasping, dying.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   We saw them taking down his body and putting it in a grave and rolling a stone.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   He died.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.000]   But he didn't see corruption.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   He is risen.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   We've seen him.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.040]   He's been amongst us with a glorified body without any element of putrefaction or of
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.560]   corruption belonging to it.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.120]   Do you know, says Peter, this is the Holy One of God.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   This is God's Christ.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.320]   This is God's Messiah.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.440]   He has risen from the dead.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.320]   The one whom the psalmist and the prophet said would rise from the dead, because he
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.220]   is the Holy One of God, has risen from the dead.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:49.200]   He is Jesus of Nazareth, and therefore Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   And then he goes on to press and to apply his message.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.480]   "Men and brethren," he says, "let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David and so
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   on.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:12.700]   Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:22.780]   whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.420]   There's no speculation here about the being and the nature of God.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.060]   There is a proclamation of fact.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.060]   Something's happened.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.060]   What is this?
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.060]   You say, "We're drunk."
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.060]   No, no.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   Do you know what this is, he said?
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.380]   This is because the Messiah of God has risen.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.980]   He's entered into heaven and has been given the gift of the Spirit, the thing prophesied
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   by Joel.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.980]   And he sent it upon us, proving that he is the Messiah, the Son of God.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.460]   But listen, he said, this is what it means for you.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:36:06.300]   This Jesus, whom you crucified but a few weeks ago, is God's Christ, is God's Messiah.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.780]   God hath made that same Jesus whom he crucified, both Christ and Lord.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   What does it mean?
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:17.220]   My friends, it means this.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.860]   God's great plan and purpose of salvation has been carried out in this person, Jesus
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:27.620]   of Nazareth.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:32.060]   Man is guilty before God and is under the condemnation of God and the wrath of God is
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.540]   upon him.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:41.820]   But God, I say, promised that he would send a Deliverer, and he did send the Deliverer.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:47.420]   And the Deliverer is none other than his own only begotten Son.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:55.260]   Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, the Holy One of God.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:03.180]   He's God come in the flesh and he came into the world because he is God's Christ, which
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.580]   means God's Messiah, God's Saviour, God's Deliverer.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.860]   Did you notice how Peter puts it in the 23rd verse, "Him being delivered by the determinate
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:18.060]   counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him by wicked hands and crucified and
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   slain"?
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.540]   What that means is this, you see.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.020]   You didn't realize it, said Peter, but when you took him and when you handed him over
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.980]   to the wicked hands of the Romans and when they crucified him on the tree and drove the
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:40.180]   nails into his hand and thrust that spear into his side, they were but carrying out
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:46.500]   the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.580]   He is God's way of reconciling men unto himself.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.740]   He is God's Christ.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.460]   As John the Baptist put it at the very beginning, "Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.900]   the sin of the world."
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.980]   Throughout the whole of the Old Testament, God had been speaking to the nation and had
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.140]   said this, "Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin."
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.820]   He says, "I'm going to offer a sacrifice myself.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.780]   You now in the meantime offer your sacrifices.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.540]   They'll point to my sacrifice."
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.740]   So he got them to kill lambs and to take their blood and offer them.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:26.340]   But when Jesus Christ came, John the Baptist pointed to him and said, "Behold, the Lamb
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.020]   of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.380]   This is God's Christ.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.940]   This is God's way of forgiving sin.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.380]   God makes him the Lamb.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.580]   He puts our sins upon him and smites him.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.900]   It's the only way of salvation.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:53.660]   That's what I have to tell you, says Peter, that Jesus, whom you crucified in your ignorance,
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.780]   is the Holy One of God.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.220]   He is God's Lamb.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.580]   He is God's way of making forgiveness for men.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.100]   But not only that, he said, he has made him Lord also.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.140]   He has made him both Lord and Christ.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.140]   What does it mean?
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   Well, it means this, you see.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:21.420]   The Jesus of Nazareth whom these people had despised and dismissed as a blasphemer and
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:30.820]   but some fellow in ignorance, has been raised from the dead and thus announced as the Son
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.020]   of God.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.420]   And he has entered into the heavens and has taken his seat at the right hand of God.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.940]   There he is as the Lord of the universe.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   God hath highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name, that at the
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:54.140]   name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things on earth and things under
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.140]   the earth.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.020]   Listen, says Peter, this Jesus is the Lord of the universe.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.620]   All power, he says, has been given unto him.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.140]   He is the moral governor.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.020]   He is the Lord of history.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.020]   Everything is in his hands.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.140]   He is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.340]   He is Lord as well as Christ.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:21.940]   But only that, said Peter, judgment has been committed to him.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.860]   He said it himself when he was in this world.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:34.100]   He said that the Father hath given authority to the Son to execute judgment also because
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.820]   he is the Son of Man.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:44.380]   Listen to me, said the apostle Peter, David hath not ascended into heavens, but he saith
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.300]   himself the Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand until I make thine inn of
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.940]   thy foes thy footstool.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.860]   Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made this same Jesus
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:06.460]   whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:15.220]   The Jesus who rose from the grave on that first Easter morning is the Lord of heaven
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.460]   and earth.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:31.260]   He is seated at the right hand of God, waiting until his foes shall be made his footstool.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.100]   This is Christianity, my friend, not U.S. speculation as to the being and the nature
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   of God, not your new morality which tells you to read Lady Chatterley's Lover and indulge
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.900]   in filth that this is the morality suitable to the twentieth century men.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:54.660]   No, no, that he is the Lord of the universe and that he'll come again.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:01.100]   And that he will come to judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.100]   He will not come to announce that everybody is going to be saved, that there is a universal
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.460]   salvation because God is love.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.500]   No, no, he's got enemies.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.260]   Until his foes, his enemies, shall be made his footstool.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.180]   He'll come to judge.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:25.660]   As he first came as a babe and died and rose again and ascended, he'll come back.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:31.300]   He's the Lord and he'll come back to wind up the universe, to judge men in righteousness
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   and to divide the sheep and the goats, to send men either to heaven or to hell.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:48.500]   The Son of God who has been in this world as Jesus of Nazareth will come back into this
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:56.860]   world again and will issue the final judgment and verdict upon all.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.180]   Therefore there is only one thing to do, said Peter.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:06.820]   It is the thing that was prophesied by John.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:22.180]   And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.620]   And the Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   He is the Christ of God.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.340]   He is God's way of salvation.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.600]   He is God's way of forgiveness.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.300]   It is because God put your sins on him and punished them there that he offers you forgiveness.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   There is no other way.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.060]   He is the Christ of God.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:49.100]   He is the Lord of God.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.060]   There is only one way of deliverance and of salvation.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:57.140]   It is to call upon the name of the Lord.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:03.100]   It is to believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God and that he came
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:08.820]   into this world in order that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   life.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.820]   You believe that.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.020]   You cry out unto him.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.420]   You give yourself to him.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.820]   You get up and you follow him.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   Call on the name of the Lord.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:31.700]   If you don't, you are amongst his foes and his enemies and you will be made his footstool.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:38.700]   And when he comes back in that judgment, you will be banished out of his glorious sight
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:46.180]   to an everlasting perdition of hell and of torment.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.500]   That is what the apostle Peter preached.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.840]   Listen to me, he said, "Men and brethren, you crucified Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.860]   You didn't know it, but you were crucifying the Christ and the Lord.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:04.300]   God hath made this same Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.540]   You crucified the one who came to save you.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.620]   You put to death the Son of God who came to deliver you.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.140]   Do you realize what you have done?"
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.140]   And they did.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.020]   When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.660]   They were stung in their heart.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:25.340]   And they said unto Peter and the rest of them, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:33.180]   Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, realize what you have done and admit it and confess
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.180]   it unto God.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.180]   Fall down and rend your hearts and not your garments.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.300]   Tell him that you have done the blunder.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.860]   Tell him that you realize what you have done.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   Ask him for mercy and compassion.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.820]   Repent and be baptized every one of you into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.220]   of sins.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:57.740]   And you'll be saved and will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.460]   Have you been pricked in the heart?
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.860]   Has this message stung you?
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:09.860]   Or are you still saying, "I'm a twentieth century man, a space man.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.500]   I'm a modern secular man.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.220]   I don't believe in miracles.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.820]   I don't believe in resurrection.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.740]   I want to understand God and I believe that God isn't up there or out there.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.260]   I believe God is depth.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.060]   He's the ground of all being."
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:27.740]   Is that it?
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:34.060]   Do you think that we with your puny mind can encompass God and understand him?
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:42.860]   Are you still trusting to your brain power, your intellect, your science, your learning,
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.020]   your anything?
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:51.860]   Well then I tell you that you're damned, you're lost.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:47:00.140]   And that when the Christ and the Lord of God will return, he will send you to the perdition
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:06.940]   that you so richly deserve.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.580]   Forget all your knowledge, my friend.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.940]   Forget the twentieth century.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.380]   It's got nothing to do with it at all.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.340]   Are you mad enough to believe that all the past nineteen centuries have believed a lie
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.660]   and nonsense and folly?
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.340]   Have all the saints and the doctors of the church been lunatics?
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.380]   And has wisdom only come in this twentieth century?
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:33.500]   Oh, the monstrous lie of the devil.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:45.020]   Forget everything but this, that Jesus of Nazareth was the Holy One of God, that he
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:54.580]   proved it by rising from the dead on that first Easter morn, that he and he alone is
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:48:04.340]   God's Christ, God's way of salvation, that he is coming again into this world and
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.500]   you will have to see him and to face him.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.100]   Every eye shall see him, yea, and they that pierced him.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:17.420]   You will have to stand in judgment before him and your philosophy will be useless and
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.460]   height and depth will be irrelevant.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.860]   The Christ of God who has been into the world and who has risen from the dead will confront
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.980]   you.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.860]   And we'll simply ask you one question.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:41.060]   Why didn't you call on my name when you were given the opportunity?
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.940]   Why didn't you believe the facts concerning me that were put before you in Westminster
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:53.180]   Chapel on Sunday evening, the 14th of April, 1963, when that feeble preacher told you that
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:49:01.500]   I am the Christ and the Lord of judgment and of the universe?
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.420]   Why didn't you believe it?
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:09.180]   Why didn't you call on my name?
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:22.980]   Because you were told, "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.060]   That is how Peter preached on the day of Pentecost.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.620]   That is how the three thousand were pricked in their hearts and believed and were added
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.100]   to the Christian church.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.380]   Have you repented?
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:45.740]   Have you realized your ignorance, your sinfulness, your vileness, your hopelessness?
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.500]   Have you realized that you'll be lost in the judgment?
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:56.820]   And have you cried out saying, "Mentor and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.460]   God grant that this message may have come to you as it came to these people on the day
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:12.100]   of Pentecost, and that if you've never done so until now, you will now cry out unto the
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.100]   Lord.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.460]   He won't refuse you.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:26.960]   He said himself in the days when he was here, "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:39.740]   cast out; call on the name of the Lord, the risen Christ, and you shall be saved here
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.740]   and now."
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.580]   Amen.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.500]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
