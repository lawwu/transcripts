[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.620]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.240]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.920]   So in the past, I've done a ton of mailbag episodes
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.880]   where I've answered questions from you all.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   And recently I did an episode where I just shared
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   a few of my thoughts on things going on in my mind.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.800]   Well, I was trying to think about this week
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.560]   whether I wanted to do another mailbag
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.380]   and I had all these things to share on my mind
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.920]   and I thought maybe I would just combine it all together.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.320]   So there's a little bit of a mailbag,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.480]   a little bit of some reactions and some thoughts,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.120]   some wins, some hacks and a whole lot more.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200]   I am sure that you are going to find value in this episode
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.320]   because there's really a lot of content.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.260]   It's mostly focused on travel and credit card points
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.660]   and miles and a little bit on kids and some deals.
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.080]   But before we jump in,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440]   I wanna talk a little bit about a few wins
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.260]   that I just felt like I needed to share
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.160]   because they were so awesome.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.600]   The first comes from Austin
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.560]   who wrote this in an Apple podcast review,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.960]   which by the way, I so, so much appreciate
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.760]   when you guys leave reviews on Spotify and Apple podcasts.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.120]   I love reading them, I feature them on the website
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   and maybe I'll start reading a few more of them on the air.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920]   So this one said, "Episode 104 saved me $15,854 a year.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.880]   They said that it pointed them in a direction
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880]   that cut their insurance policies in half
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.080]   and with better coverage and they used to sell insurance."
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   So, I mean, this might take the top position
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   for the most money saved from an episode,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.360]   at least that I've heard about.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.640]   If you've saved more than that, please let me know
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.200]   or even anywhere close.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   I'd love to collect more stories like this.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   And I actually think
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   in the new version of the website I'm building,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.060]   I'm gonna highlight some of these reviews
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.920]   and testimonials and stories.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.240]   So please send a few and you might see yourself
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760]   on the All The Hacks homepage.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.960]   Next, I wanna share a story from Christopher
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.840]   that was just an amazing example
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.860]   of what can happen at a hotel.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160]   So he was excited to take a really special trip
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.080]   to Savannah, Georgia with his family to celebrate
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.320]   and thought they'd stay in a really nice place.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.040]   So he was looking at the Palmetto Bluff
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.640]   where he said the standard king rooms
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.400]   were about $600 a night,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520]   but the double queen rooms were well over a thousand.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.480]   We had two kids, so the king room wasn't an option.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.900]   And so he wanted to figure out what to do.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.880]   He was a little bit annoyed,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.680]   but he filled out the contact us form on the website
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.940]   and said, "It's really hard for a family of four to stay
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.560]   when most of the other luxury resorts in the area
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.920]   only charge a little bit more
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.720]   for a double queen over a king."
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.760]   And they were charging such a significant premium.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   Well, a day later, the price for the two queen room
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.360]   was reset online to 700 a night
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.160]   and he made a reservation.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.000]   Well, where it really gets exciting
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   is that he found an email address for the GM of the hotel,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.580]   explained that it was his daughter's eighth birthday
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.440]   and asked if they had any recommendations
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.380]   for activities or dinner to celebrate.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.220]   And the GM passed them along to a guest relations manager
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.460]   who just asked a few questions
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.560]   and made some suggestions for activities.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.120]   Well, fast forward to the actual stay,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.320]   they ended up getting a free upgrade to a suite
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   that would have cost over $1,700 a night.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   But when they opened the door,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.480]   they were greeted to the soundtrack of "Matilda the Musical,"
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.880]   which is his daughter's favorite thing to listen to,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.200]   a bunch of balloons, gifts for his daughter,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.240]   and a bottle of wine for he and his wife.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   This might be the best story we've heard yet
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.740]   of an upgrade and an amazing experience
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.320]   just from sending an email to the GM or to the front desk
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.060]   or to the concierge of a hotel.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520]   So definitely keep doing that.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.160]   If you have any trips coming up,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.900]   just always make sure to book directly with the hotel
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.080]   or through a travel agent when you're doing it.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   Last, I wanna share a story from Michael
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.780]   who used the Card Optimizer spreadsheet I built
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.280]   to evaluate what the best card options were.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.720]   He said that just 15 minutes with the spreadsheet
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.840]   added more than $500 in additional points per year
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000]   versus the cards he already had in his wallet.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.280]   And while the price for the spreadsheet
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.600]   is actually set at pay what you want,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.720]   he found it so valuable
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   that he offered to make a donation in my name
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.120]   for $175 based on the value provided.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.500]   He made that to Charity Water,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.160]   which is an awesome organization I'm a big fan of.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.620]   So first off, I'm so excited
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.460]   that you got a ton of value from this spreadsheet.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.700]   That makes me so happy.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.980]   I wanna continue building tools like that.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.140]   Second, thank you so much for the donation you made.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.380]   It really means a lot to me and to all the people
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.620]   who are gonna have clean drinking water because of it.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.820]   And finally, if you haven't checked out the spreadsheet
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.220]   and want to, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardvalue
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.060]   and take a look.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.620]   You're also gonna get the update to V2 of the spreadsheet,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.000]   which I'm working on now.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.540]   Thanks to some awesome feedback from listeners.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.820]   So those are a few awesome wins from the audience.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.180]   Please share your wins, share your amazing stories.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.180]   I'd love to hear them.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.740]   I'd love to share them with others.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.140]   And as you'll hear in the rest of this episode,
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.380]   there's gonna be a lot more.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.520]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.580]   Signing your life away to a big wireless provider
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.180]   is kind of like being trapped on a roller coaster from hell.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.740]   Sure, it looked fun at first.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.460]   They probably threw in the free phone,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.700]   but now you can't get off.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.120]   Month after month of insane bills and unexpected thrills.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.320]   Like overages and surprise fees.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   If that sounds like your big wireless plan,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.720]   it is time to get off the ride with Mint Mobile,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.160]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.420]   For a limited time, wireless plans for Mint Mobile
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.460]   are just $15 a month.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.880]   That's unlimited talk, text, and data for just $15 a month.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.000]   I know because we just switched a line over
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.740]   so our au pair could get unlimited talk, text,
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.100]   and high-speed data delivered
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.360]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   And also so we could save hundreds of dollars a year.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.880]   Seriously, we're gonna save so much
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   without really sacrificing anything.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.680]   You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.720]   and bring your phone number
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.920]   along with all your existing contacts.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.600]   So ditch your big wireless carrier
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.320]   with Mint Mobile's limited time deal
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.880]   and get premium wireless service for just 15 bucks a month.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.840]   To get your new unlimited wireless plan
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   for just 15 bucks a month
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.760]   and get the plan shipped to your door for free,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.180]   go to allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.600]   That's allthehacks.com/mintmobile, M-I-N-T, mobile.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.920]   And cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.140]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   Okay, I wanna start talking about travel.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.400]   Mostly because we just got back
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.660]   from an incredible trip to Bora Bora a few weeks ago.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.440]   I am so fortunate that we've been able
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.960]   to go there a few times.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.620]   It's crazy that from the West Coast,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.320]   you can get to French Polynesia in just eight hours.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.760]   And even if you're not trying
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.820]   to do an aspirational business class trip,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.600]   you can find flights in coach on French Bee or United
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.140]   for less than $1,000.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.800]   So the first two trips we took
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.480]   were planned a bit more in advance.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.320]   And this one was really last minute.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.840]   I talked about it a little bit
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.320]   on the last episode I did like this.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   And it came together because I asked my parents
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.960]   if there was any time in 2023,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.880]   they might be able to help watch our girls.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.840]   And it turned out that something sooner
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   was actually the best for everyone.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.400]   And so we started looking at where we were going.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.360]   So if you wanna hear a little bit
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.840]   about how we decided where to go,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.920]   go check out episode 124.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.840]   We got an amazing deal on flights.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.440]   We ended up doing round trip on United
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.280]   and it was only 55,000 AeroPlan points each way in business.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.240]   I'll come back to that
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.000]   'cause AeroPlan has been such a great option.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.560]   But the hotels was the one
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.960]   where I really was trying to optimize
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.680]   and I'll share what ended up happening.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.460]   So I had hoped that as the dates got closer and closer,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.360]   that the availability for points would open up.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.480]   And I actually gotten an email a few weeks ago
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.560]   from Jeremy who shared his experience with Hilton,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.320]   which was very positive.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.520]   So he said they normally stay at the Grand Wailea in Maui.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.960]   Now, before I continue,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.080]   I just wanna say I am so heartbroken
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.640]   about what's going on in Maui.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.880]   We went last October and we spent the whole day in Lahaina
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.960]   and it's so sad to see what's happened
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.080]   and the destruction from all these fires.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.200]   All of our thoughts and prayers from the whole family
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.160]   are out to the people in Maui and Lahaina
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.440]   and everywhere affected.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.520]   It's been so sad to see what's happening.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   There are a lot of organizations you can contribute to
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.080]   if you wanna support the relief efforts,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   but I'll link to a few that we've made donations to
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.000]   from our Daffy account in the show notes.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   So when Jeremy last looked to book a trip there,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.360]   the rooms were over 2 million Hilton points a night
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.960]   and he checked a week before the trip
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.920]   and rooms were down to 100,000 points per night.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.440]   He ended up booking the room with points,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.760]   used a free night certificate with the Aspire card
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.440]   and got incredible value.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   He stayed the second half of the trip at the Ritz-Carlton,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.280]   which he said was a great property,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.800]   had really reasonable Bonvoy rates outside of peak time
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   and one of the best brunch buffets
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.080]   outside of Southeast Asia he's ever had.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.360]   That was also a bummer to hear
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   because we actually stayed at that same Ritz-Carlton
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.160]   and never tried out the brunch buffet,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.760]   mostly because no amount of Bonvoy status
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.840]   gets you free breakfast at the Ritz-Carlton
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.400]   and I think I was just a little annoyed by that rule,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.880]   but I have some regret.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.600]   I wish I had lived a little bit more of a die with zero life
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.120]   because the best buffet brunch outside of Southeast Asia
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.720]   sounds like a really incredible meal to have.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.880]   So hearing a story like that,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.480]   we thought if we waited till the last minute,
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.280]   some availability would open up
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.000]   and unfortunately, that just wasn't the case.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So for Bora Bora, we waited, we waited, nothing happened.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.240]   We ended up just having to book the room with dollars.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.560]   It was a little over $1,000 a night,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   but we did use the upgrade tactics.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.240]   We emailed the hotel and were able to get upgraded
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.160]   to a deluxe overwater villa,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.320]   which was absolutely incredible.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   In fact, if you go back to episode 49 on YouTube,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.480]   you can see I recorded the entire episode
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.040]   from an overwater villa in Bora Bora.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.360]   That time was at the St. Regis.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.640]   Bora Bora's incredible.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   I've talked about it multiple times,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.900]   so I won't spend much time here,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.280]   but on the West Coast,
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.780]   getting to French Polynesia is so easy.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.400]   Bora Bora, it's an amazing place to go.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.800]   It's so beautiful.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.620]   In fact, a lot of Tahiti is.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.360]   I haven't gotten a chance to explore it as much.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   I think our next trip,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.440]   we might spend some time in Morea or in Taha
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   or another island to just get more of an experience.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.340]   Unfortunately, we weren't able to use our points there,
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.560]   but we were fortunate that at the last minute,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.900]   the Hilton Tahiti,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.840]   which is a property we've never stayed at,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   it's really near the airport, it's gorgeous.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.080]   The pool was amazing.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.360]   The property was amazing.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.320]   Breakfast was amazing.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.900]   It was just such a great experience.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.240]   And that did open up for points,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.380]   which meant that I could use
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.460]   our Hilton Aspire free night certificate
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.360]   and get a free night,
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   which saved us $400 on that hotel room.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.280]   And similarly, we got a great upgrade there,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.640]   thanks to Hilton Diamond status,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.980]   which we also have from the Aspire card,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.440]   which I think might be a good time
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.260]   to just briefly talk about the Aspire card,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.160]   because I'd always thought it was a good deal.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.880]   And then finally going on this trip
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.160]   made it all come together.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.400]   So it does have a high annual fee at $450,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   but what you get,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.880]   aside from a 150,000 point welcome bonus
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.900]   after spending $4,000 in the first three months,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.060]   you get 14 X points on Hilton hotels just from the card.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.740]   That's in addition to the 20 points per dollar
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.820]   you get staying at Hilton when you're a Diamond member,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.920]   which Diamond status is another benefit of the card.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.100]   You also get a $250 Hilton resort credit.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.380]   So we instantly got that after our first night.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.180]   There's also a $250 airline fee credit.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.460]   We've been able to get that back with Southwest this year.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.780]   You also get a priority pass select membership.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.060]   We already have that through the Platinum card
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.020]   and the Chase Reserve.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.740]   So that one wasn't a big benefit for us.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.060]   And then finally you get a free night certificate.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.220]   And so if you add up what we've gotten
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.420]   just from this trip from that card,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.780]   we got $400 off a hotel room.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.260]   We've been able to get $250 airline credit.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.540]   We got a $250 resort credit.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.300]   So we're already at $900,
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.020]   but that complimentary Diamond status
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.740]   also got us breakfast at the hotel for seven nights for two,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.820]   which I don't actually remember the price,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.020]   but I wanna say was in the ballpark of $40, $50 a person.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.180]   So there's another $700.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.880]   So almost $1,600 of value from this card,
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.620]   not including the welcome bonus
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.220]   and not including the 14 points per dollar.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.380]   So all in all, incredible deal.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.860]   And so now I'm actually thinking Amy has one now,
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.960]   maybe I should get a Hilton Inspire also.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.140]   And then we'd have twice the perks,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.580]   twice the credits, twice the free nights.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.060]   So if you do spend $60,000 a year on the card,
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.300]   you earn another free night certificate.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.780]   I'm not sure that that's the best deal for our circumstances
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.780]   but definitely something to consider.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.420]   So if you're interested in the card,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.480]   Amy's referral link for that card,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.660]   which obviously we would both appreciate you using
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.380]   is allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.200]   I did wanna come back to service
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.940]   because I know one of the conversations I have with people
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.300]   who've never really stayed at a five-star resort
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.940]   is what's really the difference?
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.520]   Is it really worth that $1,000 a night?
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.540]   And what happens that is different from other properties?
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.880]   Fortunately, we heard a story from a friend of ours
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.820]   at the exact same time as a similar thing happened to us
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.680]   that I think really highlights
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.900]   both a total win for service and a total miss.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.300]   And so it turns out that both me and my friend Liz
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.540]   got sunburned when we were traveling last month.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.580]   And for me, I somehow forgot to put sunscreen on my neck.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.900]   I have no idea how I managed to get my entire body
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.300]   except my neck, but I got a little burnt.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.060]   And when I went,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.980]   and fortunately at the Hilton properties
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.820]   in French Polynesia,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.260]   there's free sunscreen and free aloe at the pool.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.060]   So I noticed the sunburn around 5.30, six o'clock,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.900]   went to the pool,
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.240]   and it turned out the pool stand was closed
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.420]   and they'd put away the sunscreen and the aloe.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.940]   Because all the hotels are kind of secluded,
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.700]   there's no store I could have gone to at this time.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.980]   So I went to the front desk and asked
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.780]   if there was any chance they could have opened up
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.740]   the little pool stand that was, I don't know,
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.180]   maybe a two-minute walk so I could get some aloe
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.540]   and put it on my neck.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.860]   And the person at the front desk said,
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.500]   "Sure, no problem, I'll send someone over."
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.500]   So I went over to the desk, waited for 15 minutes,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.820]   no one came.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.380]   Amy, meanwhile, is sitting at dinner
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.760]   waiting for me to join her.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.740]   So I give up, I walk to dinner.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.340]   It turns out that right next to the restaurant
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.740]   we were going to was a concierge.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.040]   So I tried that desk instead of the front desk and said,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.300]   "Hey, I would love it if someone could get some aloe.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.900]   You could bring it to me here at dinner,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.060]   or maybe someone could send it to the room.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.280]   Anything would be greatly appreciated."
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.460]   Well, an hour later, they came back
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.880]   and said they weren't able to do anything.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.220]   Not the end of the world.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.980]   I survived, of course.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.380]   But the story Liz told me where she was staying
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.240]   at the Rosewood in Mayacoba in Mexico
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.940]   was that she also got sunburn
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.020]   and didn't tell anyone about it, didn't say anything.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.500]   But when she got back to her room in the evening,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.980]   there was a bottle of aloe and a note that said,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.740]   "We noticed you might've gotten some sun
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.380]   and thought you'd appreciate this."
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.540]   And those little touches of service
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.500]   are what sets apart a good luxury hotel
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.100]   and a great luxury hotel.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.500]   Similarly, I remember when we were in Bali,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.260]   we were staying at the Four Seasons.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.740]   And when I was speaking with a waiter at breakfast
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.260]   and mentioned that jackfruit was my favorite fruit,
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.180]   and I loved that they have it in Bali,
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.060]   but I hadn't seen it at this hotel.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.780]   And he had relayed that message.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.200]   And the next morning at breakfast,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.060]   not only was there jackfruit,
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.600]   but a different waiter came up to me and said,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.100]   "I heard you really like jackfruit.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.900]   We got some and we brought it in."
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.560]   I can't necessarily put a price
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.160]   on what those experiences are worth,
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.340]   but they just make the whole experience
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.700]   at a hotel incredible.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.840]   Similarly, a couple of last two anecdotes,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.340]   Liz also told me that every night
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.080]   they parked bicycles at their room.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.100]   And the next morning someone had gone by
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.780]   and turned the bikes around.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.860]   So the bikes were facing the other direction.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.700]   And then another one that I thought was so minor,
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.720]   but such an opportunity for a hotel to do a great job
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.220]   was at the Conrad.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.140]   When we first got there and checked in,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.860]   they asked us, "Do you have any food allergies?"
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.860]   And we told them we have no food allergies.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.920]   And it could have been so easy
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.580]   for them to mark that somewhere
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.780]   because every time you go to any restaurant,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.580]   there's a piece of paper with every guest
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.260]   and it has all these secret codes about the guests.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.320]   And I was always looking at it,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.620]   trying to figure them out and I couldn't.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.300]   But every time we went to a restaurant,
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.860]   someone said, "Do you have any food allergies?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.220]   Do you have any food allergies?"
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.100]   And I was almost wondering
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.780]   why they even asked us at check-in
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.660]   if they weren't gonna do anything with that information.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.940]   And so if anyone has some fun examples,
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.840]   I'd love to hear them.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.140]   I always love hearing about ways
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.900]   that hotels can set themselves apart
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.940]   and what makes for an amazing experience.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.660]   My daughter is only three,
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.380]   but she starts preschool next week.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.420]   So do you want a quick back to school tip?
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.220]   You can cross everything off your list
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.060]   before the big day with DoorDash,

[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.620]   for 50% off your next order, term supply.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.500]   You all know I love credit card points,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.420]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.060]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.820]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.980]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.100]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.720]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.940]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.920]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.900]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.340]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.180]   and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.540]   Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.020]   to save even more money every day.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.540]   And with their browser extension,
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.340]   you can actually activate every single Amex
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.740]   and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.220]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.740]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.280]   any personal or banking details.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.060]   The app is free to download,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.480]   and many of the features are free as well,
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.220]   but if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.540]   there's a free trial.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.340]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.020]   which you probably will,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.980]   you can go to allthehax.com/cardpointers
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.660]   to get 20% off.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.660]   Again, that's allthehax.com/cardpointers.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.460]   I have a few other things on the topic of travel.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.300]   One, I was talking to a friend of mine named Trevor
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.440]   who was in Europe and had a flight home
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.660]   from Copenhagen to Los Angeles,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.060]   but wanted to come home a week early
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.300]   because something had come up
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.980]   and he wanted to go visit his family.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.340]   And so he actually tried to call SAS, the airline,
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.400]   to ask some questions about changing his flight
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.580]   and couldn't get anyone on the phone.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.820]   So he thought, "I'm just gonna go to the airport."
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.060]   So he went to the airport
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.460]   and he asked his first agent at the desk
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.300]   if there was any way
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.620]   that not only could he leave a week early,
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.940]   but his flight was to LA
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.180]   and he really wanted to get to San Francisco.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.960]   And it was part of a round trip
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.820]   that he was gonna use to come back to Europe,
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.540]   so he couldn't just cancel one leg
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.020]   'cause it would mess everything up.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.540]   And the first agent said, "There's no way, it's impossible.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.100]   "I can't do this, I'm sorry.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.700]   "Nothing can be done."
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.060]   So he sat down, he'd actually brought all his bags,
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.820]   so he wasn't quite sure what to do
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.780]   because he wanted to go home
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.480]   and he didn't have a place to stay.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.140]   So he's looking on his phone for a few minutes,
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.540]   trying to see if there are any other options
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.620]   and he looked up and noticed that about 15 minutes later,
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.500]   the person he'd spoke to had left.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.700]   Maybe they'd went on break
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.260]   and someone else was working at the SAS desk.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.540]   So he went up to this next agent
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.100]   and explained his whole situation again,
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.340]   was very kind, very nice and very gracious.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.740]   And that agent,
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.860]   despite that the other agent said it would be impossible,
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.820]   was able to move him to a flight to San Francisco
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.560]   for no extra cost to come home that day
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.040]   to a different airport.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.840]   So I think the takeaway for me is there's this phrase
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   that's often used in the points and miles world,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   which is hang up, call again.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.120]   If you call a credit card company or an airline
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.400]   or a hotel group and you're trying to get something done
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.080]   and you're just not getting the answer you want,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.920]   sometimes the best answer is to just hang up and try again.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.400]   And if you see it mentioned online,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.640]   it's usually abbreviated H-U-C-A, hang up, call again.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.000]   And it was just cool to see that work in real life.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.620]   It was wait till the agent's on break,
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.480]   find another agent and try again.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.460]   And I'm so glad that he was able to get home
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.100]   because it would have been way more expensive
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.620]   to change and rebook his flight.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.800]   So I'm glad that worked out.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   Continuing on the travel front,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.400]   one was around rental cars.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.840]   So it turns out for whatever reason,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.000]   we went to rent a car
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.520]   and the cheapest rental cars in Minneapolis
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.760]   were all electric.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.040]   It was either a Model 3 or it was an electric SUV
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   that was either gonna be a Volvo or a Tesla Model Y.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.560]   What I didn't think about in advance,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.480]   but I did as we checked out,
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.160]   was that unlike a gas car
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.600]   that you have to bring back with a full tank
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.900]   or get penalized or pay a much higher rate for gas,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.240]   when you return an electric car,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.360]   there's no requirement to bring it back full.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.220]   So not a huge savings,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.840]   but I just thought a really great hack
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.200]   if you rent an electric car,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.720]   you don't have to pay for that electricity
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.120]   and you can bring it back empty.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.040]   On the topic of renting cars,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.580]   I have two hacks that listeners sent in
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.220]   about renting cars in Europe.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.440]   One is from Elliot,
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.600]   who said, "Take a look at Car to Europe,"
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.560]   which is a car leasing company in Europe.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.720]   He said that it exploits a tax loophole
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.320]   that allows individuals in Europe
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.920]   to sell cars to non-Europeans without tax penalties.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.080]   And so it makes it really affordable
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.880]   for a longer term lease of a new car in Europe.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   He had a great experience.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.840]   And my friend Daniel also reached out to tell me
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.600]   that LIGU, L-I-I-G-U dot me,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.080]   is a rental car company that he recently used in France.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.240]   He used it because it was the cheapest option in Bordeaux,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.840]   but after the experience,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.960]   he's gonna use it as much as possible.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.000]   He said the whole thing was done on mobile.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.480]   It was similar to Zipcar if anyone ever used their service.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   At the airport, he was able to scan all his passport,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.520]   his driver's license.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   He got to the car, he unlocked it from his phone,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.760]   took off, didn't interact with anyone,
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.520]   and it was the most seamless experience
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.100]   he's ever had renting a car.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.260]   So check out LIGU if you're anywhere in Europe
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.280]   and you can use that.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.160]   And then a final reminder from Linda,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.880]   just make sure you video the car inside and out
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.840]   on pickup and return.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.520]   She rented a car in Slovenia and returned it back in Italy.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.160]   And while she didn't actually notice
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.140]   that the roof had a lot of dents, likely from hail,
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.520]   they were on the video.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.760]   And when she returned the car,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.440]   she was able to show the video,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.240]   prove that they were there during pickup
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.880]   and didn't get charged any extra.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.280]   Also on our Minneapolis trip, a few things.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.680]   Actually, technically we were staying in St. Paul
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   and we stayed at a hotel called the St. Paul,
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.880]   which has that like really old school luxury feel.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.200]   But when we checked in, I felt like such a rookie.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.360]   They had a sign that said, you know,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.760]   we're part of the I prefer hotel rewards program.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.120]   And I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.880]   I booked a hotel that had a rewards program
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.720]   and I didn't even know about it, sign up for it or use it.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.560]   It just felt like such a rookie move for me.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   And so while we were there, I did join the program.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.520]   Technically the terms say that you needed to be a member
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.560]   before the stay to get credit for it.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.520]   But I'm hoping that maybe because I joined
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.400]   before checkout, it will work.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.320]   The stay didn't post automatically.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.080]   I sent an email to see if there was any way
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.640]   to add the points, but so far haven't heard back.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.880]   But I will say if you're in St. Paul or Minneapolis,
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.600]   a few things we did that were amazing.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.520]   One, the Minnesota Children's Museum is incredible.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.320]   We could have spent the whole day there if we had time.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.680]   The Como Zoo and Conservatory is amazing.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.640]   It's actually free or donation based.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.960]   Shout out to Eric for the recommendation.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.000]   All the kids in the family loved it.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.280]   And then food-wise, I'll just share one restaurant
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.040]   that was really awesome called Moscow on the Hill.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.400]   We had a big family dinner
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.200]   at this amazing Russian restaurant.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.640]   Good drinks, good food, good staff.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.040]   It was just such a great experience.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.160]   So that was that trip.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.440]   One thing I noticed as I was walking through the airport,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.560]   I saw one of those airport bookstores
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.800]   and it just reminded me of a hack that Carrie sent in,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.360]   which I don't know if anyone knew because I didn't.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.520]   A lot of the airport bookstores sell books
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.360]   and they allow you to buy it, read it,
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.920]   and return it for a 50% refund
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.280]   at any participating airport store.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.800]   So she sent me a flyer
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.000]   and there's a ton of airports that participate.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.720]   LAX, Phoenix, Kansas City.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.440]   She only sent the top half of the thing
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.520]   so I can't read all of them.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.000]   JFK, Kansas City, and probably a lot more
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.600]   based on how big I think this flyer is.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.200]   So definitely a good option
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.040]   if you like reading physical books
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.520]   and you didn't know there's a read and return program.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.760]   I'll put a link in the show notes
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.680]   if you want to look up a little bit more there.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.000]   A few last quick travel things.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   One, Southwest just announced
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   that they're going to start adding free standby
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.520]   for all passengers on all ticket types.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.360]   It was more of a leak than an announcement
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.440]   so I don't think it's gone into place yet,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.480]   but even for the cheapest Southwest fares,
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.640]   you'll be able to get to the airport
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.240]   standby on an earlier flight that day free.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.200]   Jamie sent in that if you're not already linking
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.920]   your Delta and your Starbucks accounts,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.720]   you should so that you can earn Delta miles
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.600]   anytime you're purchasing at Starbucks.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.040]   Easy to find the instructions there,
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.520]   but I'll put them in the show notes.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   And then last, Uber and Marriott
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.720]   have a promo going on right now
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.560]   that if you link your Marriott and Uber accounts,
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.680]   you get 2,000 Marriott points.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   But then if you book an Uber Reserve,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.800]   which is a pre-scheduled ride,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.120]   you get 4,000 Marriott points for each ride up to four times.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.920]   And if you do all four, you get another 2,000 points.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.360]   So if you do all of that, that's 20,000 points in total.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.560]   I wouldn't book Uber rides for 4,000 points you don't need,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.040]   but if you already have a ride
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.080]   where you know you're gonna need it at a certain time,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.200]   it might be a good deal.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.440]   So I think that's everything travel
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   except a couple quick ones related to kids,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.560]   and then I'll get onto some credit card stuff.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.280]   So first off, if you book with AAA,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.840]   you can get a car seat for free
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.560]   when you use their rate with Hertz.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.520]   Otherwise, I know a lot of rental car companies
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.840]   charge 10 to $20 a day for a car seat.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.200]   We've actually started bringing the Ride Safer Travel Vest
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.320]   for our three-year-old.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.160]   It's awesome.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.280]   It takes up so much less space than a car seat.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.480]   Think of it as a harness that reroutes the seatbelt
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.960]   so that it's safe for children.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.320]   It doesn't work for a one-year-old,
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.200]   so we do actually bring a travel car seat there.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.040]   It's the Costco Senra Next.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.880]   Basically seems like everywhere you search online,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.960]   it's the recommended car seat for traveling, so we use that.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.840]   The other kid travel thing I wanna share
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.480]   is really an amazing story.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.000]   So months ago, I shared a story about a listener named Adam
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.320]   who found $4,000 in unclaimed money.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.120]   Everyone out there should be doing a quick search
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.200]   to see if you can find any unclaimed money
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.440]   because there's so many opportunities.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.600]   But that $4,000 helped him cover the cost
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.280]   of the initial order for a company called 50/50 Gear,
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.360]   which launched backpacks designed specifically for parents
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.160]   to get out with their kids.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.120]   He spent three years leading the baby registry at Amazon,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.080]   and he was always annoyed that no company made gear,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.960]   especially like a diaper bag,
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.600]   that he was actually excited to use as a dad.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.760]   And he and his good buddy from college
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.840]   decided to get together and build it.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.760]   So Adam was so grateful
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.480]   that he was able to fund part of this company
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.360]   with unclaimed money that he found from this show
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.120]   that he sent me a bag, and on our trip to Minneapolis,
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.880]   we got to use it for the first time, and it's so great.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.240]   I'm really a fan of the bag.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.120]   As far as storage and aesthetics,
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.280]   it just felt like I was carrying a backpack
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.800]   I would carry anyways,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   but it made it so easy to find all of the snacks
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.280]   and the diapers and the bottles and the waters
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   and everything we were carrying for the kids.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.760]   But I actually didn't bring a backpack for myself,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.280]   so I also used it for my laptop, my AirPods, my wallet,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.880]   my ID, my credit cards, my sunglasses, and everything else.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.840]   So huge shout out to Adam for making an amazing bag.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.720]   Thank you so much for sending it to me.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   And if anyone out there is looking for an awesome bag
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.440]   and you have kids, definitely check out 50/50 Gear.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.400]   I'll ask Adam if he has any deals
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.880]   that he wants to offer the audience,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.480]   and if so, I'll put them in the show notes
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.520]   and you can find them.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   Otherwise, I'd definitely check out this bag.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.160]   I thought it was great, and I will be continuing to use it
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.840]   as our primary bag for our kids.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.320]   Last few things on kids.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   One, this sounds so ridiculous to say out loud,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.200]   but we've been going to the library a lot.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.800]   Both of our girls love books,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.160]   but our three-year-old churns through books.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.040]   We probably read 20, 30, 40, 50 books a day,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.800]   oftentimes the same book,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.640]   and we just don't feel like we need to have
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.880]   thousands of books in our house that we've bought.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.640]   And so regularly, we've been going to the library,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.920]   which near us has an incredible children's section.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.480]   We'll check out 10, 20 books at a time.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.200]   Next week, we'll go return them and get 10, 20 more.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   So if you have kids that are young and love to read
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.000]   and you're not using the public library,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.960]   maybe I just am late to this and we just started doing it,
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.520]   but it just seemed like something that prior to children,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.080]   I wasn't using the library as much as I should.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.720]   That said, reminder that if you're looking for books
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.640]   on Amazon and you use this cool browser extension,
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.200]   Library Extension, which I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.480]   it'll actually tell you if you can get the ebook
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.840]   of any book you're looking at free from your local library.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.680]   So another good option there.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.560]   Two quick things.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   One, hack from Yelena, who in reference to episode 124,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.720]   where I talked about recording kids' stories
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   for our Tony box, she suggested checking out
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.040]   a cool app called Novel Effect,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.200]   which basically provides a really cool soundtrack
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.840]   and sound effects to stories you're reading
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.040]   and recording for your kids.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.120]   So check out Novel Effect if you're interested.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.680]   And then last, I think anyone with kids knows
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.480]   that kids get sick all the time.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.960]   There are two apps that we've recently tried
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.040]   that are kind of pediatrician telehealth on demand.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.440]   One of them is called Summer Health.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.960]   One of them is called Blueberry.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.760]   I'll link to both in the show notes.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.960]   And the premise is you pay about $20 a month
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.840]   and you get unlimited access to pediatricians
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.560]   for all of your children.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.720]   It doesn't route anything through insurance.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.960]   Summer Health is all text-based.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   So you can send lots of messages, pictures,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.040]   ask questions, get responses, pretty quick response time.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.280]   When we used Summer Health for a couple months,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.000]   it was only 10, 15 minutes before someone would reply.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.120]   And then a few days ago, our youngest daughter
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.240]   woke up with 103 degree fever,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.840]   had thrown up what looked like a little bit of bile
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.120]   in her crib, and we just wanted to get a second check,
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.320]   but it was Saturday morning.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.160]   And I knew if we messaged our pediatrician,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.360]   we probably wouldn't hear back till Monday.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.400]   So I paid the $20 to sign up for Blueberry.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.360]   And while it was a little bit of a slower response time
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   than Summer Health, it probably took an hour
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.840]   to hear back from someone.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   They also have the option to do phone calls
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.720]   and maybe even video calls, but I haven't tried that yet.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.840]   So two great options for getting access to pediatrics
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.120]   and telehealth for a pretty reasonable cost.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.240]   For Blueberry, if you actually need to do tests,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   they can send the orders over to Quest
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.000]   to be able to get results if you need to do any testing,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.840]   but then also they can send prescriptions to your pharmacy
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.560]   where you can use your insurance, of course.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.120]   And so, I don't know, I just thought I'd share those two
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.680]   for anyone out there looking for options.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.000]   I'll put links in the show notes.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.480]   If I can find a promo code or a referral code,
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.920]   I'll put those there as well.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.880]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.680]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans,
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.740]   you most likely have money anxiety.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.480]   In fact, that is one of the reasons
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.720]   I started a financial planning firm back in 2016.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.200]   And when we shut the company down,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.900]   we did extensive research on the financial service company
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.880]   we wanted to recommend to our clients,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.520]   and we landed on Facet,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.440]   and I'm excited they're sponsoring today's episode.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.680]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry on its head
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.340]   making financial planning accessible to everyone,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.080]   not just the most wealthy.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.160]   And one of the things I hated about this industry
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.040]   is that so many financial advisors
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   charge based on a high percentage of your assets,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.760]   but not Facet.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.960]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee,
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.840]   which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.960]   And they match you with your own CFP professional
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.980]   who uses industry-leading technology
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.820]   and is backed by a team of experts
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.340]   across investments, taxes, and more.
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.580]   So, tackle the uncertainty you're feeling
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.660]   about your finances and replace it
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.860]   with some real confidence about your money.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.500]   Go to allthehacks.com/facet, that's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.400]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way,
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.180]   and they'll even waive the $250 enrollment fee
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.220]   for all of you.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet, F-A-C-E-T.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.080]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.560]   Facet Wealth is an SEC-registered investment advisor.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.760]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities,
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.920]   nor is it investment, legal, or tax advice.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.600]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.340]   Terms and conditions may apply.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.760]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.640]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.760]   for a good hang.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.840]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.800]   Just make sure you do it the easy way,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.760]   and let our sponsor, Drizly, the go-to app
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.440]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.280]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.120]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.520]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.980]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.040]   that you got through another week.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.160]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.700]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.480]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.560]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.220]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.800]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.760]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.800]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.640]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.700]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.340]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.800]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.880]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   or go to drizly.com, that's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.020]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.920]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.400]   and supporting the show.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.240]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.720]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.280]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.400]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   All right, let's move on to credit cards.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.480]   I'm gonna start by talking
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.040]   about the Credit Card Competition Act,
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.160]   which a few of you emailed asking my take on.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.360]   So, for a little bit of history, back in 2010,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.960]   there was something called the Durbin Amendment,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.680]   which was part of the Dodd-Frank Act.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.880]   And what it did was really drastically restrict
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.760]   the amount of interchange, which I'll get to,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.280]   that banks could charge on debit card usage.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.160]   Now, interchange is the fees that merchants and stores pay
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.360]   to accept credit card payments and debit card payments.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.640]   And as much as the goal was to reduce costs for merchants
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.240]   and lower prices, it didn't have anywhere near the effect
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.840]   that they had originally intended.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   First off, only 1.2% of all merchants reduced prices,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.600]   about 70-something percent of them stayed the same,
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.320]   and then close to 30% of them actually raised prices.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.940]   So, if the end goal was to lower the cost for businesses
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.720]   so they would lower prices, totally failed there.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.640]   But because banks no longer had any income from debit cards,
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.760]   one, they weren't able to offer any more rewards
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.960]   on debit cards, but the bigger impact
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.720]   was that average checking account fees went up
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.960]   from $4.34 to $7.34.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.440]   Account minimums went up, maintenance fees went up,
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.760]   and there were just a ton less free checking accounts,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.520]   which had a massive negative impact
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.160]   on lower-income Americans.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.240]   So, from my perspective,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.960]   that amendment was not helpful at all.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.400]   But now that we have that context in place,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.320]   I'll talk a little bit about
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   the Credit Card Competition Act right now.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.840]   Though, it does look like Senator Durbin
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.960]   was trying to get it included
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.800]   in the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.760]   It looks like it's not in there now.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.080]   Though, Senator Durbin did say
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.360]   he's looking to find another way to get it back in.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.720]   However, it's a little different
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.040]   from the original Durbin Amendment.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.800]   So, in this new rule, it would only impact issuers
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   with over $100 billion in assets,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.680]   which is most of the major issuers we all know,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.120]   Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Amex, Capital One.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.800]   And what it does is limit those issuers
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.380]   to not having credit cards
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.360]   that only have access to one network.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.600]   Now, by networks, I mean things like Visa, MasterCard,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   Amex, Discover.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   And so, cards are no longer allowed to have one network
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.440]   and need at least two networks.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.720]   And those two networks can't be Visa and MasterCard.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.560]   Now, technically,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.400]   it's that they can't be the two largest networks,
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.840]   but Visa and MasterCard are so far ahead
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.400]   that it doesn't look like there's any chance
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.800]   that will change in the near or even distant future.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.360]   Now, again, the goal was to give more competition
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.520]   to the networks that process transactions
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   so that merchant fees can come down.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.920]   But after listening to a few experts who have takes on this,
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.720]   it seems like a really easy solution
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.640]   would be for someone like Chase to have a card
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.120]   and issue it with Visa and Amex.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.100]   So, kind of in the way that Amex has co-brand cards
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.260]   where they're not part of Amex's membership rewards,
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.380]   but they're the network,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.620]   you could actually see Chase
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.660]   offering the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.560]   as a Visa Infinite and Amex card.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.280]   Obviously, that doesn't seem normal now,
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.400]   but it seems like a good business for Amex
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.760]   because Amex would charge for that ability.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.000]   And they're probably in a pretty good negotiating place
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.960]   because they would be a requirement.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.800]   But at the end of the day,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.200]   given how unsuccessful the Durbin Amendment was
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.320]   at lowering prices,
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.840]   given the impact it had on people's accounts,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.080]   and given the fact that it seems very few lawmakers
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.480]   want to take a stand on this
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.600]   because they don't wanna upset banks,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.920]   but they also really don't wanna upset consumers.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.760]   Consumers love credit card rewards.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.680]   They're a part of society.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.640]   And I just don't think at the end of the day
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.920]   this is gonna actually come to fruition.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.960]   That said, if it does,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.200]   it doesn't seem like it's nearly as limiting
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.980]   as the Durbin Amendment was
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.840]   because it's not restricting the rates people can charge.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.920]   It's actually just requiring two networks.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.920]   And so if another network comes in,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.160]   then the question is just,
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.020]   will that network maybe reduce the amount of revenue
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.360]   that the issuer gets?
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.480]   Yes, but it's probably not gonna go
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   from one and a half to three and a half percent
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.200]   like it is now down to 0.05,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.680]   which is what happened as a result of the Durbin Amendment.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.360]   So if this were to pass,
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.000]   do we start to see some credit cards
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.800]   that were offering two X points,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.080]   maybe offer 1.5 X points,
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.400]   maybe something like that.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.660]   But I don't think, like some people have said,
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.000]   this is going to be the end of credit card rewards
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.920]   if it happens.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.560]   And personally, I actually don't think it's going to happen.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.760]   And given that it was just taken out
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.340]   of the National Defense Authorization Act,
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.800]   I think it's even less likely,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.280]   but in case it pops up again,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.140]   I thought it'd be good to give it a little quick cover.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.060]   Also on credit cards,
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.480]   you guys have sent in so many great questions
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.400]   that as I've been planning out the content for this show
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.960]   for the next six to 12 months,
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.200]   I've decided to do an entire,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.680]   it's not really a series, maybe a set of episodes
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.080]   on a bunch of different topics
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.780]   related to credit card rewards.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.760]   It'll probably start off with, you know,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.280]   kind of a basic high level 101,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.360]   but I'll include one on earning points,
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.800]   redeeming points, meeting minimum spend,
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.480]   tools for booking awards,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.080]   specifically on flights and hotels,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.760]   and how to work with player two.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.040]   If there's any other big themes of topics
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.320]   you have on credit cards,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.640]   let me know as I'm planning all of these out.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.320]   But there were a few pointed questions
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.520]   that I don't think necessarily fit into those episodes.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.400]   So I'm going to tackle them quickly here.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.080]   So Nick wrote in because he got an email from Capital One
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.580]   asking if he wanted to switch his venture card
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.200]   from a credit card to a charge card.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.120]   And the main difference between those two things
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.720]   is that a charge card doesn't let you carry a balance
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.560]   and pay interest,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.500]   which I hope for anyone listening
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.440]   and trying to optimize the points game,
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.560]   you're not carrying a balance
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.680]   and you're not paying interest.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.960]   If you are, then that is your priority.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.520]   Don't worry about credit card rewards,
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.880]   pay off the credit card debt.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.440]   However, with a charge card, there isn't always a limit,
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.600]   which means the limit isn't reported to credit bureaus.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.440]   It actually means that there's a potential in the future
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.080]   that Capital One could decide that your limit is lower
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.560]   because it's not a specifically stated limit.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.640]   For me, I wouldn't accept the change
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.660]   because I want Capital One to report a limit on that card.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.800]   The Venture and Venture X cards
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.640]   are actually known for having higher limits.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.240]   Having a higher limit would only increase
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.760]   the total amount of credit you have available to you.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   And so I think that would be helpful.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.740]   The only argument I could make
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.960]   for potentially wanting to make this change
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.160]   is if you are using this card
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.860]   and constantly at a very high utilization rate on the card,
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.560]   let's say you have a $10,000 limit
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.040]   and you're always over eight or $9,000,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.600]   that could have a negative impact on your credit score
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.780]   because you have such a high utilization
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.040]   that it might make sense to switch it to a charge card.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.960]   Otherwise, I'm all in on staying as a credit card.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   I actually think I might've gotten this email
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.080]   and immediately dismissed it.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.880]   Another question from Lauren was,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.000]   "I transferred Amex points to United or Delta
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.080]   "and I had to pay sales tax on the transfer.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.400]   "Is that normal?"
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.180]   And I had to think about it for a little bit
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.540]   and even do a little bit of homework
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.960]   because I don't remember this.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.820]   And it turns out that when transferring to U.S. Airlines,
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.960]   not international airlines and not hotel programs,
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.240]   this does happen.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.640]   So the easiest way to do that
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.520]   is to avoid transferring to U.S. Airlines,
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.760]   which is pretty easy.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.800]   I think the best value from Amex comes from Air Canada,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.580]   Air France, British Airways.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.000]   So I actually don't think I've run across this issue,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.440]   but yes, it's called an excise tax offset fee.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   It's currently 0.06 cents per point up to a maximum of $99.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.420]   You can use your points to cover the fee
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.240]   or you can just pay it on your balance.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.440]   Next, I wanna share a handful of deals
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.080]   that I think are worth taking a look at.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.880]   First off, some of the transfer bonuses
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.160]   that are happening right now.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.840]   There's three on Amex.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.760]   If you're transferring to British Airways,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.360]   you get an extra 30% until the end of August.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.400]   If you're transferring to Avianca Life Miles,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.520]   you get an extra 15%.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.040]   Both of those are great options.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.300]   I've used Avianca and British Airways in 2023
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.560]   for booking two different types of rewards.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.480]   For British Airways, it was domestic flight on American
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.220]   in first to New York, which was amazing.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.640]   And then I used some Life Miles
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.760]   just to book a flight from San Francisco down to San Diego
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.900]   because it was only, I think, 5,000 points
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.680]   and the flight was almost $300.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.240]   So it was a great point value.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.000]   And if I could have gotten an extra 15%,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.280]   it would have been even better.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.860]   There's also a 25% bonus transferring to Hilton from Amex
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.080]   and a 50% bonus transferring from Chase to Marriott.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.760]   The Hilton one ends at the end of August.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.960]   The Marriott one ends at the end of September.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.400]   For all of these,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.880]   I think the hotel ones are less exciting to me
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.680]   just because hotel points from Amex and Chase
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.280]   typically don't offer as much value as airlines,
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.160]   but for all of these, I think the same rule applies.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.300]   None of these transfer bonuses are amazing enough
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.600]   that I would transfer anything speculatively.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.560]   So I would wait until you have a flight you're ready to book
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.280]   that you can book with these programs.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.240]   And if you found them and it's a good deal,
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.440]   then transfer the points.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.560]   Second deal that I wanna highlight, which is really cool,
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.640]   is that it seems like Bilt has finally confirmed a promotion
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.800]   that they've been offering new cardholders.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.400]   So for anyone who doesn't remember,
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.460]   Bilt is a credit card that offers you points on rent
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.560]   up to, I think, $100,000 of rent a year.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.080]   That doesn't require you to use a specific portal.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.240]   They will even mail a check to your landlord.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.280]   So if you pay rent,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.920]   I think the Bilt card is an absolute no-brainer.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.200]   It's incredible.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.400]   Also, even if you don't pay rent,
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.640]   the Bilt card offers three points on dining,
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.280]   two points on travel.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.000]   They do have a requirement that you use the card
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.120]   five times each statement period,
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.200]   but I think for a primary card like that,
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.120]   it's pretty easy to do.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.260]   Bilt points probably are my favorite points currency
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.140]   out there because you've got a lot of the mainstays
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.860]   like a lot of the other points programs have,
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.280]   Air France, British Airways, Air Canada Aeroplan, Virgin,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.940]   but you also get United, American, Hyatt,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.460]   and Turkish Airlines.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.340]   So if I could get more Bilt points, I would.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.240]   I wish they had 10 cards with amazing welcome bonuses,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.220]   but they don't.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.960]   However, you do get 5X points on all purchases
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.940]   in the first five days that does cap out at 50,000 points.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.380]   But if you have a large purchase around $10,000
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.880]   and you can time it to use it within the first five days
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.340]   of getting your Bilt card,
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.460]   I think this is an awesome option.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.300]   I'm actually so excited about Bilt points
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.020]   that I'm thinking about potentially getting a Bilt card
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.100]   just so that I can start earning more points.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.540]   It'll probably be mostly focused on dining,
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.300]   especially whenever Amex isn't taken.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.860]   I don't have another card that earns more
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.700]   than three points on dining.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.940]   The card is also a World Elite Mastercard.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.260]   So it comes with cell phone protection,
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.880]   purchase protection, and a bunch of other travel benefits
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.460]   when it comes to trip cancellation,
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.740]   delay reimbursement, and things like that.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.740]   So I'm a big fan of the Bilt card.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.560]   If I paid rent, I would have had it the day it came out.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.380]   If they ever add points on mortgages,
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.460]   I will get it if I haven't already.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.820]   One of the other great things about Bilt
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.020]   is that you can sign up for a Bilt rewards account
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.660]   even if you don't have a Bilt credit card.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.700]   And you might think, why would I wanna do that?
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.740]   But Bilt has partnered with Point.me,
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.140]   which is one of my favorite award search tools
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.380]   for finding good flight deals on points.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.540]   And you can use the Bilt search to search Point.me for free
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.980]   without having to sign up for a Point.me account
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.700]   with the only caveat that it only searches airlines
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.320]   in Bilt's program.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.860]   But Bilt has a ton of overlap with Amex
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.660]   and Chase and Capital One.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.300]   So if you wanna do some initial searches for free
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.140]   and see how Point.me works,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.180]   you can create a free Bilt rewards account.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.440]   They also have big promos every first of the month,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.300]   which they call Rent Day, where you earn double points,
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.180]   6X dining, 4X travel and 2X on everything else.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.300]   And they sometimes have some really,
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.700]   really crazy transfer bonuses.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.700]   August 1st, they were offering between a 75 and 150% bonus
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.760]   on transfers to Virgin Atlantic,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.540]   meaning for every one point you transferred,
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.160]   you'd get 1.75 to 2.5 points.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.060]   I didn't really have a redemption in mind,
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.820]   but transfer bonuses like that
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.740]   are probably among the only that I would say
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.060]   could make sense for a speculative transfer
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.460]   where you don't know what you need it for,
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.260]   but the deal's just so good.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.580]   So as a Bilt Rewards member, even without the card,
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.620]   you also earn some points from referrals.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.980]   So if you're gonna sign up,
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.100]   I would love it if you wanna use my referral link.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.180]   It's just allthehacks.com/bilt, B-I-L-T.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.820]   Or if you sign up and you wanna refer someone else,
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.620]   definitely earn yourself some points too.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.280]   Last two cards I wanna mention.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.620]   I talked earlier how I love the Aeroplan program,
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.220]   especially with United devaluing their miles.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.100]   Aeroplan's a transfer partner of Chase,
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.340]   Amex, Cap One, and Bilt.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.500]   They also have their own credit card with Chase,
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.700]   and it's a 100,000 point welcome bonus.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.000]   The reason I bring it up is because I think
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.720]   I should probably bring up any welcome bonus,
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.900]   especially for airlines or credit card points
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.440]   that hits the six-figure mark.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.180]   It's 75,000 points after you spend $4,000 in three months,
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.120]   and another 25,000 points
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.680]   if you spend $20,000 in 12 months.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.320]   Like I mentioned, I was able to get round-trip tickets
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.840]   down to French Polynesia from San Francisco in business
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.580]   for 55,000 Aeroplan points in business class,
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.480]   where on United, that same flight,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.160]   I think was about 80,000.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.360]   So really great points.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.760]   So that card is something to consider.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.620]   And then last, the Spark Cash Plus card from Capital One.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.800]   This card is my primary business card for all the hacks.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.340]   Every expense that I have
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.100]   that isn't in a bonus category goes here.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.020]   It earns two points per dollar,
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.660]   though technically it earns 2% cash back.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.640]   But that cash back, if you have a Venture, Venture X,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.180]   or Spark Miles card,
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.340]   you can use that cash back as miles and transfer it.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.680]   And they have a big welcome bonus of 120,000 points.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.260]   It does require $30,000 of spend in three months.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.540]   So it's definitely a big spend,
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.020]   but you do get two points per dollar on everything
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.560]   or 2% cash back.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.260]   So this is one of those rare cases
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.940]   where to hit that welcome bonus,
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.180]   it could make sense to pay your taxes.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.160]   Pay a 1.87% fee,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.400]   knowing that you're getting 2% cash back.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.240]   So you're not losing money on the fee,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.040]   but you're also gonna get 120,000 points.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.460]   So not all of us, myself included,
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.440]   spend $30,000 in three months.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.460]   I am gonna do an episode on meeting minimum spend later.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.020]   So hopefully that'll be helpful.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.360]   But Spark Cash Plus,
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.460]   it's my primary Capital One card for all business expenses.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.560]   It does have $150 annual fee,
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.820]   but 120,000 Capital One points,
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.820]   I value it well over $2,000.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.380]   So this is a really, really big offer if you have a business.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.060]   And keep in mind, business doesn't mean
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.260]   you necessarily have to have a big company with employees,
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.460]   any type of income, or even aspirations of income
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.460]   from a side hustle, from driving for Lyft or Uber,
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.120]   from selling something online, from a blog.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.740]   Maybe one day you aspire
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.660]   to have sponsored Instagram content, who knows?
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.900]   But the definition of business is very wide.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.340]   And if you search around online,
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.420]   there's a lot of information
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.900]   about eligibility for business cards,
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.540]   and you can do it under your own social.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.340]   So that's everything credit cards right now.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.700]   Like I said, there is a lot more that I wanna cover,
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.100]   which is why I'm gonna do a whole series of episodes
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.600]   on credit cards in the near future.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.620]   And if you wanna support me and the show,
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.820]   you can sign up for any of those cards,
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.300]   and really any card you're looking at,
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.960]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.840]   Notably, there are a few cards not on that list,
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.740]   like the Hilton Aspire and the Built card,
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.300]   which is why I sometimes share links
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.380]   like allthehacks.com/built and allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.560]   Those are just referral links,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.180]   'cause they're not a part of that program.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.260]   But I really appreciate you guys using those links
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.380]   and helping support the show.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.980]   Actually, one more credit card adjacent thing.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.380]   If you log into Amex, and Chase and Capital One
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.520]   have this too, but I find that Amex's deals
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.060]   are a lot more compelling.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.660]   There's a section of offers related
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.820]   to each one of your cards,
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.120]   where different merchants will offer deals
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.140]   for using your Amex card to make purchases.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.940]   And when you log on, you'll usually only see 100 of them.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.140]   But if you were using an app like Card Pointers,
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.260]   you can add all of them.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.360]   Right now, I have 280 added to my account.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.260]   Also remember, one of the other perks
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.040]   of using Card Pointers is not only
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.940]   that you can add more than 100 offers,
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.260]   it's that they add the offers at the exact same time.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.100]   Every now and then,
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.700]   there's some really, really compelling offers
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   that you might wanna use multiple times.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.460]   Or if you are using a merchant that lets you split payment,
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.580]   you could use once, but split payment between two cards.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.300]   Normally, when you click an offer,
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.600]   it immediately takes it out of all your other cards.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.500]   But it turns out that if you were to click those buttons
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.380]   at the exact same time, which is how Card Pointers does it,
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.880]   you get to add them to both cards.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.180]   And if you haven't used Card Pointers,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.340]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.040]   There's a trial of the pro version,
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.540]   but you can also get 30% off Card Pointers Pro
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.780]   as an AllTheHacks listener.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.180]   You could just go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.220]   I use it all the time,
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.880]   every time I log into Chase and Amex
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.340]   to add all these offers.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.980]   But two other things.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.460]   One, I just played around with the beta version
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.060]   of Card Pointers 5.0 for the iPhone, and it's amazing.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.660]   I'm so excited for this new version of the app.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.020]   But also if you're an AllTheHacks member,
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.360]   you get 50% off Card Pointers Pro.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.740]   So even better deal.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.660]   Thanks to Emmanuel, the founder, for hooking everyone up.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.660]   If you're not already a member,
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.940]   you can go to allthehacks.com/join
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.300]   and get all the other deals
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.540]   that we have exclusively for members.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.340]   And you can join a really awesome community.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.540]   We're actually starting to do a bunch of breakouts
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.060]   within the membership.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.080]   So we're gonna do a session on both topics
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.980]   we've covered in recent episodes,
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.340]   but also other topics that are just generally interesting.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.140]   Think small group discussions
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.000]   with people that have a common interest or question,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.280]   really getting a little deeper
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.940]   than we get here on the podcast,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.580]   'cause it's really more focused on discussion.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.020]   All that said, let's talk about some of these Amex offers,
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.240]   'cause there were some really cool ones.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.920]   So if you already pay for Google One,
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.580]   which is their cloud storage,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.580]   there's an Amex offer for 20% off.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.900]   The most interesting offers,
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.960]   I've never seen these offers before,
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.700]   are there was an offer for France, Italy, and the UK,
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.460]   which was spend $200 in France on any one purchase
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.020]   and get $40 back,
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.580]   spend $300 in Italy and get $50 back,
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.600]   or spend $100 in the UK and get $20 back.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.400]   So 16 to 20% off any single transaction
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.820]   in those three countries.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.740]   A nice restaurant could easily cover those,
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.080]   maybe two restaurants if you have both cards,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.140]   maybe four if you're going to multiple countries.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.460]   So I thought that was a really cool offer
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.460]   I'd never seen something like that.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.180]   Also, if you're ever interested
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.240]   in trying out Athletic Greens,
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.660]   you've probably heard me talk about them.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.980]   They're a sponsor of the show.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.220]   I'm a really big fan.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.740]   I had one this morning,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:13.740]   but AG1, there's an offer for $25 off, $125 for AG1.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.700]   So that's interesting.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:17.220]   You can also stack it with the All The Hacks offer
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.740]   for five free travel packs
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.140]   and some free immune-supporting vitamin D.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.540]   So that's allthehacks.com/ag1.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.900]   If you're a fan of Blue Bottle Coffee,
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.380]   there was an offer for five off, $25.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.540]   And then finally, there are a couple cool hotel ones
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.100]   if you have trips planned.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.020]   If you're using Marriott Homes and Villas,
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.820]   there's a $250 off, $1,000.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.540]   If you're staying at a Hilton in Canada,
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.740]   there's $100 off, $500.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.940]   If you're staying at a Wyndham, there's $60 off, $300.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.680]   And if you're staying at a Hyatt Centric,
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.860]   there's $75 off, $300.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.740]   Now these offers actually vary
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:53.220]   based on your individual spending patterns and cards.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.880]   So you might not have all of these
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.240]   and you might have some other ones that are even better.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.540]   So if you ever notice a really awesome offer in there,
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.220]   definitely feel free to share it with me.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.740]   I might not have it in my account,
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.600]   but I might love to tell everyone listening about it.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.780]   Finally, I'm gonna start trying to get a newsletter out
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.700]   a bit more frequently than these mailbag episodes
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:15.420]   anytime I see some of these offers or deals
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.860]   that are really short-term.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.060]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/email,
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.660]   you can sign up for the newsletter.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.380]   It'll put you on the main newsletter
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.220]   and it'll put you on this latest deals newsletter,
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.540]   which I haven't sent yet.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.200]   If you ever don't wanna be on the main newsletter,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.720]   but you do wanna stay on the latest deals newsletter,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.260]   whenever you go to unsubscribe,
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.300]   you can uncheck free newsletter
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.240]   and leave the latest deals on.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.380]   And as soon as I start sending that one, you'll get it.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.340]   And hopefully deals like the ones I just mentioned from Amex
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.360]   and other things will be in your inbox
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.220]   faster than they will be on the podcast.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.000]   So that's everything cards.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.460]   There are two big topics I wanted to cover today.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.980]   One is money and one is life.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.660]   And within each, I have a bunch of things to cover,
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.580]   but I'm looking at how long we've been going
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.100]   and I feel like it might be better to take a break
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.140]   and pick this back up in a week or two
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.460]   and continue with money and life.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.700]   I'll tell you a little preview
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.900]   of what I'm thinking of doing in the episodes,
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.880]   but also if you have other things
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.500]   you'd like to hear me talk about in the money and life camps,
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.940]   please send them over so I can include them.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.060]   On the money side,
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.820]   I wanna talk about when to sell IBONs.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.200]   I know a lot of us pick them up
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.780]   when the interest rates were so high
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.900]   and now have to decide when we wanna close out,
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:24.020]   sell, and put that money to work somewhere else.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.100]   When it comes to putting money to work somewhere else,
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.140]   I wanna talk about the options I'm thinking about
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.580]   for earning interest on non-investments.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.960]   So that's T-bills, that's high-yield savings accounts,
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.840]   that's the new Wealthfront Bond Portfolio,
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.980]   which a few of you have asked me to give feedback on,
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.460]   and it's also how bank bonuses fit into this picture.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.140]   I've been comparing a few of the options
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.580]   both for earning miles and bonuses,
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.740]   and I'm thinking that there are some cases
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.260]   where they actually might be more compelling
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.300]   in high-yield savings or anything else.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.500]   On the life side,
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.820]   after the episode with David Chang on Cooking at Home,
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.100]   you guys sent in some really great cooking hacks.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.220]   If you have more, please share them.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.500]   I'll talk a little bit about data brokers online
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.860]   and how I'm seeing my personal information pop up
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:05.140]   and what I'm doing about it.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:08.780]   I went really deep in the last few days on cell phone plans,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.540]   and I've actually gotten three or four emails
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.100]   in the last month about them.
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.460]   So I'm gonna do a pretty deep dive
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.940]   in this next episode on cell phone plans
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.960]   and all the ones, at least in the states
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.500]   that I'm considering, how I'm thinking about them.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.580]   The only change I've made so far
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.860]   is that we've moved Stefania, our au pair,
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.180]   off of Verizon and onto Mint Mobile
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.680]   because it's just such a better deal.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.540]   And so far, she's had no concerns with the service.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.860]   She said it's been just as good, if not better,
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.500]   and it's literally like less than 30% of the cost.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.820]   Big fan of Mint Mobile.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.100]   She's super happy.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.780]   I'm happy to be saving money.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.980]   So that was a good move.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.020]   And by now, you've probably already heard an ad
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.640]   in this episode for Mint Mobile,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.280]   because as you know from the past,
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.400]   when I find a brand I like,
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.880]   I really try to see if there's a way I can work with them,
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.960]   which I did in this case.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.920]   So you can go to allthehacks.com/mintmobile
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.160]   if you wanna check them out and support the show.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.160]   But beyond Mint Mobile,
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   I actually went deep on all the other plans
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.360]   with all the other carriers,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.760]   thinking about which plans make sense for me and Amy
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.320]   based on international travel and a few other requirements.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.040]   So I'll go deep there.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.440]   And then just a few other hacks that people have shared
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.920]   when it comes to shopping online.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.080]   Storing photos and things like that.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.920]   So if there's anything else you guys haven't heard
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.320]   that you love me to touch on in the money and life category,
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.480]   send it over quickly,
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.080]   because I'm gonna start recording that episode
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.200]   at the end of this week,
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.340]   and I wanna make sure I can include other things in it.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.200]   That wraps up this week.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.560]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.100]   Thank you so much for sending in
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.480]   all these great questions, topics.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.680]   Hope you liked this episode.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.520]   It was a little bit of a hybrid.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.800]   Thoughts, ideas, wins, hacks, questions.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.200]   I'm probably gonna keep doing these.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.320]   I might even include a little bit of reflection
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.520]   on some takeaways from episodes recently
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.200]   that I've been really thinking about.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.160]   Think of it as like a stop along the way
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.520]   towards a best of 2023 episode
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.040]   that'll be coming out at the end of the year.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.740]   Finally, if you're enjoying this show
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.680]   and you haven't left a review on Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.400]   I'd greatly appreciate it.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.200]   It only takes a couple minutes
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.360]   and every one of them is so helpful.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.360]   And like I said earlier,
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.800]   I'm gonna start featuring reviews on the homepage
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.320]   of the newly designed website.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.360]   I'm really excited to share that with you.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.500]   So there's a good chance that that review,
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.240]   especially if it has a really punchy, exciting title
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.680]   or first sentence, will make it on the website.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.140]   So things like how much you've saved,
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.920]   how valuable it's been to your life would be great.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.320]   All right, that's it for this week.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.160]   See you next week.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:57.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
