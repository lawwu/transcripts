[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   I've sometimes wondered whether or not
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.060]   parents are either afraid of
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.400]   or not afraid enough of their kids.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.580]   I've known some parents that are afraid of their kids
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.380]   because, and perhaps as a consequence,
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.260]   who knows what the chicken egg is there.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.360]   All we know is the parent was alive first.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.180]   The kids learn to control their parents
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.340]   through not necessarily emotional outbursts,
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.460]   but the threat of emotional outbursts.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.180]   I've seen this again and again,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.760]   and it's a pretty wild thing to observe.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.160]   And of course, as an observer,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.960]   it's far easier than when you're in it,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540]   but this idea like,
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.440]   well, like they're like a pot ready to boil over,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.220]   you know, like they're gonna pop.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.060]   And I've seen this in teachers in the classroom.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.100]   I've seen this in so many venues
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.940]   where whether or not the child understands
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.540]   that they're somehow controlling the situation or not,
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.060]   there's just an inherent fear of what could happen.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.220]   And then I think kids feel a certain power,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740]   but they don't feel safe, right?
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.140]   I mean, how could they, right?
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140]   They're children.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140]   - Yes.
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.660]   - So for the parents out there
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.920]   that are afraid of their kids' potential responses
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.780]   and/or how bad their kid, quote, unquote,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.220]   might turn out if they were to really lay down the law.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.260]   Here I'm using kind of old school language.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.180]   Listen, I grew up, you know, I'm 48 years old.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.480]   So, you know, yeah, I mean,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.940]   my parents, you know, didn't physically abuse us,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.140]   but there might've been a spanking every once in a while,
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.900]   or I don't know what the rule is nowadays
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.380]   or the standard out there.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.180]   You know, I think, I won't say which,
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260]   but I might've taken a smack here or there, but not many.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.080]   And there was also a lot of love.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.280]   But clearly, and here I'm not supporting
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.820]   the use of corporal punishment.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.760]   I want to be very clear.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.400]   But, you know, kids can be tough.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.080]   And then also, you know,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.920]   it wasn't long into my high school years
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.320]   when I was physically larger than both my parents.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.040]   I never used that to intimidate them,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.000]   but I have to imagine when your kid is larger than you,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.760]   if you were already psychologically afraid of them,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.920]   now it's clear to both of you
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.780]   that the tables have turned.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.620]   - That's right.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.440]   - Right?
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.460]   I'm talking about the unconscious,
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.180]   semi-conscious aspects of this.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940]   I'm not talking about who can, you know,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.260]   obviously physical fights.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.580]   There's not something I ever want to see
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.040]   or participate in in a household.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.120]   - So this is an amazing topic, like walking on eggshells.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.780]   This is right?
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.400]   And this is terrifying to a kid.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.340]   Because again, if a kid is trying to figure out,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.420]   like, am I real?
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.240]   And am I safe?
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.380]   Kids do experience feelings in such an intense way
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.740]   because they don't have any of those skills
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.980]   and they're so surprising and they're so visceral
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.620]   that it is scary to them.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.120]   And there are kind of, especially these groups of kids,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.340]   I call them deeply feeling kids,
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.040]   that do feel things more intensely.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.860]   And they do have more of these big, massive tantrums.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.500]   They even look animalistic often during,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.380]   they try to scratch you.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.620]   They'll hiss during them.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.460]   They'll growl.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.300]   - Hiss, really?
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.180]   - Yes.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.100]   - I grew up with some biters.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.940]   - Yeah.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.760]   - Kids that bite.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.980]   Because again, those are just feelings literally uncontained
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.060]   that are exploding out.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.100]   And where do they explode out?
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.940]   Through your extremities.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.180]   So they, that's really what it is.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.020]   And so what will happen,
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.900]   and this is this really unfortunate dance
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.340]   and one of my favorite things to help people turn around,
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.620]   is then kids kind of sense from a parent,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.780]   like, I really am as toxic as I worried I was.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780]   Right?
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.200]   And again, if we go back to that pilot thing,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.420]   like I think about a pilot,
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.640]   it's like, we have to make an emergency landing.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.680]   We're not gonna be able to go to LA.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.120]   And we're all gonna land in Cleveland, whatever it is.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.000]   I picture the passenger who's like,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "You are going to take us to LA."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.160]   And the pilot's like, "Okay, okay."
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.520]   Like, can you imagine?
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.560]   You're like, it doesn't matter that this person is pissed.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   Like, you're the pilot.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   You don't have to keep us happy.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.040]   Please keep us safe.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.920]   And if you're on that plane and you're terrified
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.600]   'cause you're like, we have to make an emergency landing,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.960]   I promise you, you're way more terrified
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.940]   when you hear this person change the decision
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.320]   because of the threat that a passenger
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.040]   is going to be very, very upset.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.000]   And that is actually what we do
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.660]   when we're walking around on eggshells.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.460]   Now, the alternative to this, again,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.360]   we live in this world in parenting where there's a binary,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.400]   where we say, and you said it yourself,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.440]   so I'm gonna lay down the law.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   Like, I don't recommend that either.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.720]   Like, especially with a kid like that,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.560]   that's not gonna be the best solution.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.320]   These kids have to be seen as good kids.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.440]   They are good kids.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.720]   And when I meet with parents of these kids,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   I hear about them.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.880]   And like, I always say, I hear about them.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.240]   And I have a kid like this, so I get it.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.080]   And I'm just like, I really like your kid.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.160]   And they're like, what?
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   I was like, I do.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.600]   And they're like, and then they usually start crying.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   And they go, you're literally the first person in 11 years
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   who's ever said that, including like the parents.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.120]   Like, you like our kid, why?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.080]   I'm like, they're tenacious.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.400]   They know what they want.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   They seem like they have 0% people pleasing in them.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.440]   These kids will change the world,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.880]   but not if they're boundary lists,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.380]   then they'll become tyrants.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.300]   And that's really terrifying.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.400]   And I'm gonna teach you how to be the sturdy leader,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.360]   which is equally firm as it is warm.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.600]   And that's gonna start today.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   And so like, here's an example of these deeply feeling kids.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.680]   I think you said something about like watching
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.080]   like a TV show where these kids,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   it feels like they hold the family emotionally hostage.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.920]   And because if you don't pick the movie
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.100]   that they wanna watch on family movie night,
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.360]   they will scream, they will cry,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.660]   and they will do that for three hours.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.500]   They will.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.720]   Other kids after you're like,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.640]   they don't peter out, these kids.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.040]   These kids, interestingly enough,
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.960]   get in an awful cycle with their parents
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.440]   because they have such intense emotions more often,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.720]   which more escalations,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.640]   which tend to get met with invalidation.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.120]   You're so dramatic.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   You ruin everything.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.500]   They are that much more desperate to be believed.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.000]   They escalate further.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.120]   You can understand how that will lead
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.080]   to more distance and invalidation.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.440]   And we're off to the races in a bad direction.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.840]   And I would say to the parents,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280]   during family movie night tomorrow night,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   this is what you're gonna do.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.880]   And you're gonna, by the way,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.800]   I would say, this is how concrete I get.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.640]   You're gonna write this down
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.200]   and you're gonna say it to a voice recorder
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.020]   with your own voice.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.000]   And I want you to play it back
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.640]   and see how sturdy you sound.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.480]   And they'll often do it.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.040]   They'll be like, wow, I didn't even believe myself
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.880]   when I said that.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   I'm so scared of my child.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   You're gonna do it again.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   And then you're gonna do it again.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.120]   And this is just like any other skill we practice.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.480]   And you're gonna say to your kid,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.680]   look, I know in this family,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.240]   Bobby, usually we let him pick the movie.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.120]   He gets really upset.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.140]   If not, well, tonight's gonna be different.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.440]   Bobby, it is your sister's turn to pick the movie.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.560]   And I know you're gonna be upset.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.400]   And I just wanna tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.960]   And I'm gonna, in this example,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.320]   I'm saying there's a two-family household,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.160]   which is an assumption.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.080]   But even if there's one,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.840]   I'm gonna say, if you're super upset and screaming,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.200]   I'm going to bring you to your room.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.480]   And this is important.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.920]   I'm gonna sit with you and I'm gonna stay there.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   And this is a line that I know
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   from our Deeply Feeling Kid workshop has really,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.520]   and you have to believe it to say it.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.040]   I am not scared of your feelings.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.860]   And I know parents will say to me,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.320]   but Dr. Becky, I am scared of their feelings.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.280]   I'm like, yeah, you're gonna fake it till you make it.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.960]   They need to hear that.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.600]   Because if you think about the image of these kids,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.140]   their feelings feel so overpowering to them.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.100]   They feel more,
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.040]   but they're actually more porous to the world.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.760]   So they both have more coming in
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.200]   and they're actually always terrified
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.880]   of how much of them can flow out.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.640]   And so they feel their feelings that way.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.240]   It's almost like my tantrum in the house
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.800]   takes up the entire living room.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.160]   That's why you actually have to bring them to a smaller room.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.760]   And you actually have to contain them in that way
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.440]   as a way of kind of saying, like, it only goes this far.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.520]   Like literally, I will not let you dictate family movie
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.280]   and always sitting in the front seat
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.460]   and your favorite chair at dinner.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.800]   It only goes this far.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.280]   And that is truly an act of love and protection
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.540]   and safety for those kids.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.400]   - How often do you observe that these deeply feeling kids,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.320]   is that how they're referred to?
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I made up the term, so, but yeah.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.200]   - Great. - Deeply feeling kids, yes.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.080]   - You are qualified to, qualified to.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   So deeply feeling kids also express these deep feelings
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.280]   in the positive sense.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.480]   I mean, 'cause I can think of some kids I grew up with
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   and I can look at my own experience of like,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.320]   it's hard to know.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.440]   We don't have a calibration point.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.320]   It's not like body temperature of like how much I feel
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.240]   versus how much you feel.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.080]   We look at the external expression of these things.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.480]   Like did the lacrimal glands secrete some tears or not?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.760]   Like, you know, as you were talking about this thing
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.640]   before I'd noticed, I like welled up a little bit
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   and I'm thinking, yeah, like I can remember seeing things
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.220]   and feeling things and like, whoa, it's a really big inside.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.080]   I don't remember screaming at my parents,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.640]   telling them I hate them.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.220]   I probably did at some point.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:19.720]   But I have observed other kids, peers that grew up
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.000]   that clearly fell into this category
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   and have gone on to do remarkable things.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   Remarkable, like extraordinary things.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.560]   Because it's a capacity
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.040]   that doesn't always skew towards a negative expression.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.120]   It can also like immense expressions of love.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.800]   And, you know, I think these days that there's a tendency
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   to for unqualified or like truly unqualified people
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.240]   because they're not trained to do so,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.400]   to slap labels like borderline, right?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.720]   Splitting, like good object, bad object, splitting.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.200]   And indeed that exists as a diagnosis
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.100]   and symptoms of borderline.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.760]   But that we punish rather than believe and observe
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.880]   that these things exist.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   There's range in nervous system tuning and affect.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.200]   And so put simply, do deeply feeling kids
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   also tend to express love and joy and positive emotions
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.000]   with the same intensity or near same intensity?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.600]   - I would say it depends on like,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.560]   it depends on kind of their stage of development
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.680]   and the nature of the interactions
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.240]   they've kind of received back.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.760]   I think deeply feeling kids, I always say are super sensors.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.160]   Like if you've won these kids and I've won these kids,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.000]   we live in New York City.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.440]   She will not go into a New York City garage, okay?
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.560]   Like where we park our car.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.680]   And she's like, "The smell."
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.080]   And the rest of us are like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.820]   Meanwhile, I have another friend
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.800]   who lives in totally different area of Manhattan
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.760]   and she's a deeply feeling kid.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.640]   She's like, "My daughter, the same thing."
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.180]   Like, I actually believe that my daughter smells something
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.860]   that I don't smell.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.040]   Like they are super sensors in that way, right?
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.440]   And she notices the little detail of something.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.160]   Now, in terms of the intense love, I think for these kids,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.000]   their vulnerability sits so close to their shame.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.640]   This is why they get so explosive.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.800]   They almost experience their feelings as attackers,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.560]   which is again, why parents can get scared of them.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.140]   And they do, because again,
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.840]   they feel that feeling so intensely
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.480]   that they have this deep fear of abandonment,
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.760]   of being too much.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.360]   And so that shame tries to shut it down,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.800]   although it obviously doesn't work and it explodes.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.840]   What I've noticed with deeply feeling kids,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.960]   and this to me is actually like
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.720]   truly my proudest body of work.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.520]   And you mentioned borderline, so we'll go there.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.640]   People have said like, these sound almost like kids
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.240]   who are like have some predilection to borderline.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.580]   And obviously having gone to a PhD program,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.860]   we're told a lot about invalidating environments
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.700]   and things like that.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.060]   I'm not really one for labels either,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.560]   but I just got so much insight from my,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.440]   honestly, my own kid where I was like,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.000]   "Wow, like she is so different in how she processes things
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.680]   and what she needs and how she responds
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.080]   to my very same interactions as my other kids."
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.920]   Like, they're very different.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.440]   And that fear of abandonment and being too much,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.520]   it was like, it was like there from the start.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.960]   It really feels like it was like there.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.920]   What's so interesting is I feel like through working
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.320]   with her, by the way, in a very different way,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720]   'cause these kids reject almost every typical
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.920]   parenting strategy.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.400]   You go to validate these kids' feelings,
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.200]   it's like you're trying to intrude on them
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.040]   and steal their heart.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.280]   Because if you think about their porousness,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.080]   they're so terrified of being taken over
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.640]   that when you're like seeing a feeling,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.280]   they feel like you're like seeing into them.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.920]   And so they reject you.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.260]   I always say, you can't go in the front door
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.100]   with these kids.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.800]   You've got to like find these side door approaches.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   But now of all my kids, she is by far the cuddliest,
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   the most loving, the most emphatic about our relationship.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.600]   Oh, this trip now, I'm gonna miss you so much.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.000]   Like the idea when she was four that any of that,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.640]   I would say to someone like, "You are crazy.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.240]   You are talking about a different kid."
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.040]   So I think that, yes, that deep love is there.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.000]   And we just have to kind of make it a little safer
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.800]   for those kids to access it.
