[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   Will some saints in heaven experience more joy than others do?
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.680]   Today's question comes from Jordi, a new pastor in the Albertan Prairies of Canada.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.160]   Dear Pastor John, I recently listened through the 2004 Desiring God Pastors Conference,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.200]   Money, Ministry, and the Magnificence of Christ,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.560]   and one of the topics that arose in the speaker panel was the concept of varying rewards in heaven.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.860]   You and Randy Alcorn, quoting Edwards, both hold that the reward is increased capacity for joy in Christ.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.780]   Could you expand some more on where you are getting this understanding,
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.180]   biblically?
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.760]   Well, first of all,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.000]   let me clarify that I don't mean to imply, in talking that way, that there are not other
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.220]   ways in the age to come
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.000]   that our rewards are
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.980]   experienced as different. Jesus says you're gonna reign over ten cities, I'm gonna reign over five cities, and I think
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.960]   that means very concretely and specifically it may happen just that way.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.720]   You may be the mayor of ten big cities, and I may be the mayor of five little cities, and I don't mean to imply those
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.960]   specificities lose all their concreteness.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.440]   So don't take it that way.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.960]   But what we find in the New Testament is that the greatness of our
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.800]   rewards in the age to come are said, or is said, to correspond
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.440]   to the life of obedience that we've lived here. We don't earn the rewards.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.820]   They're graciously given by God.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.820]   We don't deserve them, and
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.540]   they will be evidences that God looks with favor upon his own work of grace in our lives working through us.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.800]   So the rewards are
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.840]   intended not as evidences of being earned, but rather as occasions for
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.320]   happiness in
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   heaven, not
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.600]   disappointment. But if they are occasions for happiness, and
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   some people have greater rewards than others,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.020]   will not some people be happier than others?
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.440]   But isn't the picture of heaven where every tear is
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.520]   dried up, and every sorrow will be removed, and in God's presence is
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.640]   fullness of joy for all believers, Psalm 16, 11.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   So on the one hand,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   you have every saint promised fullness of joy—I think that's right—and on the other hand, we're promised
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   differing rewards, which are occasions for greater or lesser
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.160]   joy.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   So how does that work? That's the question.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.120]   So let me simply read a few passages so you get real clear textual foundation
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   for the issue here. These are texts that get at the
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.640]   differentiation in rewards in the age to come. 2 Corinthians 5.10, "For we must all
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.200]   appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.840]   so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.640]   the body, whether good or evil."
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.960]   Revelations 2.23, "I will give to each of you according to your works."
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.800]   Ephesians 6.5, "Bond-servants,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.480]   do the will of God from the heart, rendering service with the good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that"—
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   this is really important—"knowing that whatever good anyone does,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.920]   this he will receive back from the Lord." That's amazing!
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.360]   Every single good deed gets a special
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.840]   response from God in the age to come. Or Luke 19.17, "Well done, good servant, because you've been faithful in very little.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.760]   You shall have authority over ten cities and then another over five."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.280]   Or lastly, Matthew 10.41, "The one who receives a prophet,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.600]   because he's a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward. And the one who receives a righteous person, because he's a righteous person, will receive a
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.680]   righteous person's
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.760]   reward. And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he will by no means lose his
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.120]   reward." So there will be all these
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   differences among us in the age to come, but all of us will have
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   fullness of joy. So what's the solution?
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.040]   Well, here's the textual pointer. You could just philosophically work it out the way Edwards
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.760]   does, but here's a textual pointer to suggest he's right, biblically right. Luke 6.37 and 38 go like this,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   "Judge not that you not be judged.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.280]   Condemn not and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   Give,"
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.880]   like being generous, "Give and it will be given to you.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.240]   Good measure,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.960]   pressed down,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.560]   shaken together,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.880]   running over,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   will be put into your lap. For
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.280]   with the measure you use,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.240]   it will be measured back to you." What does that mean?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   Everybody's lap is full,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.400]   but with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. Well, here's what Linsky says, that he's right.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.440]   In other words, by our
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:58.080]   giving, our being generous to people, we build the measure that is the size of our cup
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.160]   that God's going to use. We build the measure that will be used for giving back to us.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.760]   Our own measure is used to measure back to us. By using it
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.920]   ourselves, we declare to God, "That's what we want you to use at the end," end quote from Linsky.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.520]   So, will those who give God a small ladle
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.480]   be defective or lacking in fullness of joy?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.640]   No, they won't, because Jesus says, "Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.520]   You'll be full, more than full. It's all grace.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.840]   But your capacity for fullness has been determined, it seems, this is my interpretation,
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   by your generosity to others." Otherwise, the text seems to lose its point.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.640]   So, everyone is full in heaven, but some cups are larger, some
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.760]   containers are larger than others. Or what about Luke 6:33? "Sell your possessions and give to the needy.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.640]   Provide, in this way, provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.040]   with treasure in heaven that does not fail, where no thief approaches, no moth destroys." In other words,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.320]   the way you provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old and treasure in heaven is
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.480]   "give to the needy." The ageless money bags and the treasure in heaven are metaphors
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.440]   for heavenly joy.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:39.760]   I don't think Jesus means literal money bags in heaven. Who cares? We own everything, right?
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.800]   Paul says we own everything. 1 Corinthians 3 21, you don't need any money in heaven.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.400]   It's a picture of the measure of our joy in Christ as our treasure, and
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.380]   how do we prepare to experience that joy?
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:03.560]   Jesus says, "Give to the needy." We lay up treasure in heaven, and
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.320]   clearly he meant get about it, because if you don't, you won't have as much. If we lay up treasure in heaven,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   that is, we increase our joy in heaven. We do this not by
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.840]   hoarding treasure on the earth, but by using our possessions
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   sacrificially and
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:29.120]   generously, and if we do that a lot, our treasures are large in heaven. Our
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   capacities for joy are
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.400]   greater. So,
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.200]   yes, I think Edwards and lots of other people are right,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.000]   I think, to say that all believers enjoy
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.880]   fullness of
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.640]   joy or pleasure in the age to come, but some people will have larger cups, larger
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:59.400]   capacities for that joy than others, but no one will be envious, and no one will brag,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.800]   because part of the fullness is perfect love.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   That's a mind-blowing perspective and motivator for personal generosity. It's very convicting. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.680]   And that is a great question, Jordi.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.120]   These are the kind of questions that we address three times per week on the podcast, and for more information about us, you can find
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:26.960]   our audio feeds in our episode archive, and you can reach us via email all through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:34.120]   On Wednesday, we hear from a student who wants to know, "Is it possible for him to be faithful to God at school
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.560]   while also pursuing popularity?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:44.480]   What is the give-and-take? What are the pressures? Is such a balance even possible in the first place, and is it wise to pursue?"
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.720]   I'm your host, Tony Renke. We'll see you on Wednesday.
