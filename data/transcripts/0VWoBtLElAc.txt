[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   Welcome back. John chapter 9, verse 3 is a classic text for us at Desiring God
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.000]   when it comes to understanding God's good design in human disability.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   In six ABJ episodes, we've talked about the man born blind and Jesus' explanation for why he was born blind.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Just a profound story, a profound revelation of God's purposes.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But today we're looking at a different part of that story.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   You'll remember that Jesus spit on the ground, mixed his saliva with dirt, made mud,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   applied that paste to the man's blind eyes, and then he sent him off to wash it all off in a pool.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And that's where his eyesight was restored.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Let me read this account for us in John chapter 9, verses 1 to 7.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Quote, "As he, Jesus, passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And his disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sent this man or his parents that he was born blind?'"
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Got to be a reason why, right?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   "And Jesus answered, 'It was not that this man sent or his parents,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   but that the works of God might be displayed in him.'"
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   There's the key text. Why does disability exist?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Profound response with wide-ranging implications.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Then we read this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "Having said these things, Jesus spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud and said to him, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,'"
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   which means "sent."
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   "So he went and washed and came back seeing."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Healed him with mud. Why?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Could have said, "Eyes open," and they would have opened.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He's done that.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He used mud and spit.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I have a lot of ideas why.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'll just give you the one that's most obvious in the text, least controversial.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I think it's manifest.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Namely, he used mud because he knew it was Saturday, Sabbath.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And it's against the law to knead dough or clay or mud.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   One of the 39 interpretations of the Pharisees as to what it means not to work on Sunday was,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "You can't knead dough."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And the word for dough is identical, palon, to the word mud or clay.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Like brick masons, "Give me some more mud."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And all they mean is a big clump of moldable cement.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And women working with their bread, they could call it mud.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They usually don't.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   But it's the same word.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He knew exactly what he's doing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "I'm going to break the law.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm going to do it in a way that breaks the law."
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The law as the Pharisees understood it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Why would he want to do that?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Because he's the Lord of the Sabbath, and he wants to show that he is,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   or to show what the point of the Sabbath is.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Rest.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Why?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Why, why, why do you need rest?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Healing.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   If you don't rest, you die.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Rest is weekly therapy for dying bodies.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Get well.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Stop working.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So I'm just really illustrating with this.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What else would you do on the Sabbath but make eyes see?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Especially if you're God, and you want to show that you're the creator
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and sustainer and healer.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But that's--I don't think any of those is the main reason why he did it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I think the main reason was to trigger the controversy.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Yes, and it sure did that.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But there's a second reason why Pastor John thinks Jesus used the means of spit
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and dust and mud and a pool, a second reason Pastor John didn't deliver from the pulpit,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and that's likely due to time limits, but it's included in his written manuscript online.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   The sermon notes that he had with him in the pulpit, he gives a second reason.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So I'll read that second reason myself.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Here's what he wrote in his manuscript.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   "The second reason for the mud is to show that God usually uses means
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   in doing his wonderful works in this world.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Jesus could have simply spoken and the man's eyes would have been opened,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   but most of the wonders of God in the Old Testament were brought about by the use of human means.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   (Roberts 21:31)
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   God is decisive in the victory, but he uses means.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   He doesn't need the horse, but he uses the horse.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Ponder this in the bigger picture of life for a moment.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   What this means is that God does not despise the physical world he has made.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He uses the means of food to sustain life.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He uses the means of sex to beget children.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And he uses a thousand remedies to bring about healing,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   from sleep to penicillin, from vitamins to radiation,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   from sunshine on the skin to cough syrup for the throat.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And lest you think this removes the mystery of God's wonderful work,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   consider boring down through layer after layer after layer of physical causes
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and why antibiotics work against strep.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Forty or fifty layers down into the molecular subatomic activities
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   of the smallest particles or non-particles,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   there comes a point where there is no explanation inside this closed material system.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The final explanation is always God.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And if our hearts are alive and humble and worshipful,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   we will not stop until we see God at the bottom of everything.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's no small thing to believe that God uses means to accomplish his purposes.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And his purposes are that the glory of his work would be displayed.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And therefore the heavens declare the glory of God,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and the sky above proclaims his handiwork, Psalm 19, 1.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And so does all the rest of creation, if we have eyes to see.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Jesus used mud. We may use mud. Or medicine.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   The difference is how close to the surface the miracle is.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Let your life be full of wonder at the works of God and full of worship."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   End quote.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   That's from a sermon titled, "The Works of God in the Worship of Jesus,"
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   preached on June 4, 2011.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The audio and full transcript can be found online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Should the world admire us? Should the world love us?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Should the world despise us? Should the world hate us?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Which response means that we are most faithful to God?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's a great question. You want to ask Pastor John.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I want to ask Pastor John that question.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And we will next time when he's back in the studio with us on Friday.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   [Silence]
