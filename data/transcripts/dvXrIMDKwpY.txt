[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - A couple of related emails came in recently.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.040]   One woman writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.360]   "Pastor John, in a culture obsessed with diet,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.640]   "nutrition, health, and weight loss,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   "and with different information coming from every side,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.200]   "how can we care for our bodies to the glory of God
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   "without making them an idol?"
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.160]   And Becky writes in to ask,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.760]   "Pastor John, what does the Bible say
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   "about plastic surgery and Botox?"
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000]   - Well, that's a great question on how to find,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.600]   I think it's right to say this,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   find the middle way between idolizing the body
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.560]   and neglecting the body.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.360]   And here's a good place to start, maybe.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   A massively important text on the body
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.960]   and God's view of it and importance of it.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.720]   This is 1 Corinthians 6, 19.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.080]   "Do you not know that your body is the temple
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   "of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.680]   "You are not your own.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.360]   "You were bought with a price.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.520]   "So glorify God in your body."
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   So five massive statements that should blow us away
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.400]   concerning our own bodies.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   God is in your body, the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.160]   Number two, God, put God in your body.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.980]   You didn't absorb him in some natural way.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.920]   We have the Holy Spirit from God.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840]   Three, your body does not belong to you, therefore.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   Four, your body was bought by the blood of Jesus.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.960]   Five, you exist in your body to make God look glorious.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.120]   I mean, that is a, you could write a book on that.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.000]   It's just glorious theology of our bodies.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.580]   And I think every man and every woman should meditate
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.220]   on those statements concerning their body.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.820]   When it says glorify God in your body,
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.860]   it means use your body in a way that shows
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.500]   that your body is not your God.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.300]   Use your body in a way that shows
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.940]   that God is more precious than your body.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.620]   Paul said, one of my favorite texts,
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.300]   he built Christian hedonism on it, is Philippians 1:20.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.840]   It's my eager expectation and hope
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100]   that Christ will be magnified in my body,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.700]   whether by life or by death.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.120]   So he wants while he's living,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.140]   his body to be an instrument of magnifying God.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.320]   And when he dies, he wants to die well with his body
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   so that people can see that his treasure is Christ
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.880]   and not his body and its health and its life.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.200]   So we need to give enough attention, I think,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.700]   to our bodies so that we keep them fit for Christ
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.120]   and serviceable in his cause.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   And we may need to give our bodies to imprisonment
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480]   or whipping or execution or death
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   to show that Christ is more precious than the body.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.280]   So there is a middle way of eating and exercise
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.240]   that doesn't fall off the horse
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.620]   on the side of neglect of the body,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.520]   as though it were worthless,
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.680]   or the side of idolizing the body as though it were God.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   It just keeps us healthy with a kind of what I would call
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.840]   maybe undistracting attractiveness.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Like when I think about,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.040]   should I comb my hair in the morning?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640]   Well, yes, because if I walk out and it's all knotted,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.520]   people will be distracted from me.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.700]   They will be thinking about this stupid forgetful hair.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.120]   So there's a kind of undistracting attractiveness
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.760]   that doesn't call excessive attention to ourselves
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.680]   and distract from our personhood.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.600]   And that middle way of simplicity shows
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.880]   that God is gloriously satisfying
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.080]   and certainly way more satisfying than wrinkle-free cheeks
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.160]   or smooth thighs or flowing hair
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.400]   or whatever it is that is causing us to lose sleep at night
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.560]   and making us go towards some kind of temporary fix
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.760]   that is probably out of place
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.820]   for a person who's really content in God.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.320]   So people can tell, can't they, Tony?
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.560]   People around you, it seems to me,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   can tell if you're focused more on the inner person of beauty
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.440]   than the outer person of beauty.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.280]   1 Peter 3, "Don't let your adorning be external,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.020]   "braiding of hair, putting on of gold jewelry,
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.480]   "clothing you wear.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.260]   "Let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.580]   "with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.840]   "that is pleasing in God's sight."
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.880]   I think there's an application of that for men,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.360]   even though it's written for women,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.420]   that both should focus on the inner beauty
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.640]   of godliness and holiness
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.400]   rather than the external beauty of our bodies.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.720]   I don't think Christians should be very impressed
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   with our bodies.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.160]   I love C.S. Lewis, and I think he's quoting
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.240]   some medieval person who called his body brother ass,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   which is to say, yes, he's serviceable,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.920]   he's not very impressive, he's loyal,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   he does what he has to do, he gets me where I need to go.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.120]   I'm just not real impressed with my body
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.840]   any more than I am with my donkey
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.200]   because 98% of the people in the world look ordinary,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.560]   and if they don't look ordinary now,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.840]   they're gonna look ordinary real soon.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   They're gonna get wrinkled, they're gonna get old,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.320]   they're gonna get bent over,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   and all that they thought was what they had worked for
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.040]   is gonna go away, and the most voluptuous female body
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.680]   you have ever seen in your life
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.560]   is gonna be ashen-faced in a coffin before she knows it,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.680]   and then where will be all the investments
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.320]   in that temporary outward beauty?
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.600]   So maybe just a couple of last thoughts.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.120]   I'm thinking of this for women who may be single
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.720]   and may want to be fit and attractive for a man someday
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.440]   if God would be pleased, and I would just say to them,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   if a man doesn't want a woman's good soul
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.880]   more than a woman's good body,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.800]   he's not the kind of man you want.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.760]   So don't pour all your energies
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.280]   into trying to get his attention
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   to the very thing that is to be secondary in his affections.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.680]   And the second thing to close with maybe is
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.000]   God knit us together in our mother's womb.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.320]   He really made our basic structures,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.920]   and there's some of 'em you're just not gonna change.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.880]   The kind of hair you got, the kind of nose you got,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.600]   the kind of hips you've got, the kind of height you've got,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.000]   the kind of complexion you've got,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.480]   these are things that are just given
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.520]   with our God-given genetics,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.200]   and therefore it really is a matter of trust, isn't it?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.040]   Do we trust him?
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   Did God blow it with me?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   Did he make a mistake with me?
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.880]   God doesn't make mistakes.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.280]   So let's all present our bodies
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   with all their pluses and minuses
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.480]   as a living sacrifice, acceptable to God.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.360]   This is our spiritual worship.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.040]   Thank you, Pastor John,
