[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   So I want to talk to you today about a piece of my own productivity toolkit that I don't
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.600]   think I have talked much about before, but it's key to my operation.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.920]   It's also an exercise I just went through preparing for the fall quarter that is just
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.920]   beginning.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.320]   So I thought this was a great time to talk about it because I could use examples for
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.740]   my own life as I just went through this.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.720]   So what is this tool we're going to talk about?
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.000]   I call it the weekly template.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.380]   To understand the weekly template, we have to briefly zoom out and remind ourselves about
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.000]   how my multiscale planning framework works because weekly templates fit into this framework.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   All right, quick review for the new listeners.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.060]   In multiscale planning, you start at the timescale of the current quarter.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.640]   It's like right now you'd be thinking about the fall and you have a strategic plan or
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.960]   quarterly plan for that period of time.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.160]   What are the big things I'm working on?
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.180]   What are the goals I have for this quarter?
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.980]   What do I want to keep in mind that is important to me in this quarter?
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.440]   This is where you keep yourself oriented towards the big picture of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.760]   Every week at the beginning of the week, you look at your quarterly plan to help you create
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000]   your weekly plan for the week ahead, right?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.520]   This is where you actually look at what's going to happen in the days.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.840]   You're going to spend a lot of time here with your calendar.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.020]   You're going to spend a lot of time here with whatever task capture system you use.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.720]   You're going to put aside time when you're working on your weekly plan on your calendar
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.600]   for the week to make progress on important initiatives to protect that time.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.840]   This is where you might also make adjustments to your current plans.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.680]   You know what, I'm going to cancel this meeting and move this meeting over here because that's
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.600]   going to free up a lot of time here and I need a lot of time to get this bigger initiative
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.660]   done.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.440]   You then look at your weekly plan every morning when you create your daily plan.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.120]   And there I suggest time blocking, give every minute of your day a job, end with a clear
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.420]   shutdown.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.480]   So in this way, your big picture vision as capturing your quarterly plan is influencing
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   everything you're doing throughout the day without requiring you to think about your
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.800]   big picture plan at every moment throughout your day.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.880]   All right, so here's where the weekly template comes in.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.280]   It is a piece of supporting infrastructure to span from your quarterly plan to your weekly
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.760]   plan.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.140]   So the way I want you to think about your weekly template is a collection of guidelines
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.400]   that you put in place at the beginning of a quarter that you consistently plan when
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.140]   you're working on your weekly plan.
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700]   So it's a way to, at a scale somewhat larger than each week, make sure that your weeks
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.980]   are going to be viable to move you where you want to go.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980]   That's pretty vague.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.700]   So what I want to do is go through one, two, three, four, four types of things that you
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.900]   would put in a weekly template and then hopefully this mechanism becomes more clear.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.340]   All right, the first element that might be in a weekly template is protected time.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.220]   That's where you decide for this whole quarter, there is a certain time each week that I am
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.740]   preemptively protecting.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.740]   So for myself, for example, in my current weekly template for the fall, I don't have
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.140]   any teaching in the mornings and my plan is mornings are for writing at least until 1030,
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.060]   but later on days when I can go later.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.660]   That's part of my weekly template.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.580]   I've actually gone through and just protected that time on my calendar for the entire fall.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.660]   So part of my weekly template is I'm writing in the morning.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700]   You might, for example, have regular protected time for I exercise every day at my lunch
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   hour.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.340]   You might have regular protected time for you're working on a self-education project
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.260]   to open up new career capital opportunities.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.100]   This is when I do my learning.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.860]   So just fixing in advance, this time I'm always using for this particular type of activity.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.100]   That's a big element of a weekly template.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.500]   Now I'm going to give you an advanced gloss on that tip.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.820]   Hard thing about having a simple rule about this time is always dedicated to this activity
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.040]   is that you will have exceptions.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.460]   Let me use myself as an example here.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.200]   I want to write every morning and I'm willing to be a pain about this, by the way.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.940]   I'm willing in the moment to be a pain and say, no, I'm sorry, I know it would be convenient
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.780]   for everyone if I could meet at 930.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.220]   I can't do things in the morning.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.060]   Like I'm willing to protect this, but there's, there's two things I can't get around.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.700]   Once a month, we have a faculty meeting.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.660]   Faculty meetings have always been on Friday mornings.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.500]   I can't miss the faculty meetings.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.260]   The other thing I can't get around is that my kid's school, when they have events at
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.380]   school where parents come in to see kids work the way they do it, and I appreciate this
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.740]   is like, let's just do this first thing in the morning, as soon as school starts.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.220]   So parents can then go on to their work days without having missed too much.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.220]   So clearly when those things happen, that will interrupt my plan of writing first thing
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.220]   in the morning.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.420]   So I have these two exceptions I know I can't get around.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.380]   So what I have is a exception handling routine where I say, great, when those two things
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.680]   happen, I have a very specific thing I do to compensate for that lost time.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.300]   So the faculty meeting, as soon as that's over, I'm going to this library on campus,
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.520]   90 minutes writing.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.060]   If I have to go in to my kid's school, I'm going straight from the school to this coffee
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.300]   shop writing right away.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.380]   So I have an exception handling routine there as part of my protected time in my template.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.740]   All right, second common element of a weekly template, daily themes.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.700]   You start thinking, okay, for the quarter ahead, maybe I want to dedicate different
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.780]   days of the week for different types of activities.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.620]   This is something you want to figure out ahead of time.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.940]   For example, you might have meeting days and non-meeting days.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.740]   You know, okay, I want to keep Mondays free of meetings.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.740]   So I can really get into the week and get my arms around things, make progress on things.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.780]   Mondays are non-meeting days.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.260]   That's a weekly template decision.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.180]   Every week you apply that to your week when you're making your plan.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.580]   You might say, for example, I want to theme what type of roles I work on on different
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.580]   days.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580]   So maybe I need to do meetings every day of the week, but I'm going to put meetings on
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.660]   this particular role on Tuesdays and meetings for this particular role on Wednesdays, right?
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.660]   These are regular rules that you keep in mind when it comes time to actually schedule.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.420]   In my own academic career, I often have, for example, class days versus non-class days.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.500]   Class days are days where I'm teaching.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.740]   I treat those days differently in my weekly template when I think about what I do there
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.020]   versus non-class days.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.820]   I like to meet with students on class days.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.620]   I like to do Georgetown-related administrative work on class days.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.340]   If I have meetings with an administrator or an advising dean or something like this, let's
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.420]   do this on class days.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.820]   Let's make the theme of class days the non-research part of being a professor.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.820]   And then on a research day, well, I'm going to schedule most few of those things.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.220]   So I can have more unbroken time to actually work on thinking deeply.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.180]   You can also have, for example, Fridays as a lighter day, or your theme for Fridays is
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.540]   no meetings in the afternoon, finish at three, so theming days.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.540]   That's a weekly template.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.820]   I'm always doing this on these particular days.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.780]   The third way on the third element that could go into a weekly template, regular rules and
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.780]   limits.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.780]   Right?
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.900]   So this is not about particular time, but more about particular rules or limits to the
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.120]   things that are coming towards you that you're going to enforce for the particular quarter.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.980]   So for example, a rule example might be, every time a meeting or call is scheduled on my
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.860]   calendar, I am going to make sure there is 15 minutes at the end of that calendar event
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.780]   for processing that meeting or call.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.860]   Now, this either means I put aside an hour and make it clear that this call or meeting
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.500]   is for 45 minutes, or I'm adding 15 minutes to the other end of the hour-long meeting
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.700]   or call, however you want to do it.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.060]   But this is like a very useful rule.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.060]   It's a case study.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.340]   It's an example.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.740]   This way you can process things discussed in a meeting, get things into your systems,
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.140]   clear your head before you move on.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   Right?
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.960]   This is like a useful type of rule.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.700]   Limits might be things like, I'm not speaking this semester.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.020]   This is very specific to me as a writer, but there's certainly quarters where, let's say,
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.540]   I'm deep in the trying to finish a book manuscript, or I'm on a book tour for a book manuscript
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.660]   where I will just have a simple rule, I'm taking on no speaking gigs.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660]   Right?
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.140]   I just have a simple rule like that.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.660]   These could also be quotas.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.700]   I am only doing one podcast a week.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.160]   That's an actual quota I have in place right now.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.540]   This fall, I was on a book tour in the spring.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.540]   Now I'm not on a book tour.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.580]   I don't want to stop completely spreading the word about my new book, Slow Productivity.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.180]   But I also do not want to be in that five to 10 podcasts a week like it was during book
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.180]   tour.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.180]   I really need to be focusing on other things now.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.740]   So I have a simple rule, one podcast per week.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.500]   If that week has this podcast, I just don't make it available.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.860]   Having these rules in place makes it so easy to react to the incoming.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.500]   You might have a similar rule, for example, with committees you're joining.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.060]   Okay, I'm just going to do two committees.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.060]   That's it.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.060]   I have to choose two committees I'm going to be on.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.020]   There's only five peer review papers I'm going to do.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.180]   Maybe there's a particular type of thing you get pulled into in your company and you say,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.820]   I'm not going to do that more than once a month.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.300]   Once I've done it once for a month, I'll say no, not till the next month.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.660]   So rules and limits are a part of a weekly template.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.740]   Finally, autopilot scheduling.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.260]   Looking at things that you know occur regularly or will recur regularly throughout the quarter
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.300]   and say, when do I want to do it?
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.660]   I just want to figure that out in advance.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.740]   I don't want to be each week when I sit down to do my weekly planning, asking myself, when
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.900]   am I going to find time for this?
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.220]   I'm going to make that decision at the beginning of the quarter.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.100]   Friday afternoons is when I do this type of work.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.460]   The online class I'm taking, that's first thing in the morning, Monday and Wednesdays.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.620]   I don't want to have to think about it.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.620]   That's just when it is.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.620]   That's just when I do it.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.620]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.180]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:08.660]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.080]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.460]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.260]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260]   Check it out.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.580]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.460]   One of the more interesting things and one of the more effective things you can add as
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.880]   part of your autopiloting for your weekly schedule is office hours, all right?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.780]   When do I want to regularly have time to handle short things that are going to require back
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.660]   and forth interaction and get it out of my inbox?
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.880]   I'll give you an example of that from today.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.760]   I won't get too specific.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.040]   It's like a Georgetown administrative example.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   Someone wrote me from the department.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.840]   There's a couple of things.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   None of it that complicated.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.680]   It had to do with class registration and this class is too full.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.960]   This one might not be enough people.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.040]   Nothing super complicated, but it was a little ambiguous, like, "Well, so how can I be useful
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   here?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   What's really the issue?"
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.760]   So my first instinct was, "Let me just send back an email now so I can get this out of
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.820]   my inbox and that's just going to be kind of clarifying, we'll kind of go back and forth
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.820]   and figure this out."
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.160]   I said, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.080]   We could do this in 45 seconds of talking."
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.640]   So I said, "Let's just talk it.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.800]   We were going to see each other later."
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   It took 45 seconds.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   Like, "So what'd you mean by this?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   Do you need this from me?
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   No.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   What about that?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   Great.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   Oh, one exception.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360]   Great.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   Okay, good."
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   45 seconds, we were done.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   Office hours allows you to get that compression on a regular basis.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.520]   And then at the same time, you can push in interactions that require more than like one
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.120]   message back in response, right?
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.500]   So just autopiloting, where is the regular stuff actually going to happen?
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.800]   There's clearly some overlap between autopiloting and time protection.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.060]   Time protection is more like my mornings are for writing.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.360]   The exact details of that might depend on the day, right?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.760]   Time protection might be Friday afternoons, I go to the cabin in the woods and just do
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.800]   brainstorming, right?
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.680]   Autopilot is more like this hour on this day is when I prep my course.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.420]   This is when I go through my batch.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.680]   So it's much more like specific time blocks that you know are going to happen on a regular
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   basis.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   So there's some overlap there.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.600]   Anyway, so these type of things go into a weekly template.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.400]   So your weekly template, I have a fall weekly template, just goes in your quarterly plan.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   It's right there on the top.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.680]   Like, here's my general template I want to follow each week.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.120]   When I'm scheduling my week, think about what's in the template.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.720]   It really does make a difference.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.680]   Because you don't have to go through all of the thought processes required to figure out
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   these elements of your weekly template.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.340]   You don't have to go through those from scratch each week.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.480]   Some weeks when you're creating your weekly plan, you have a good cup of coffee, you got
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   a good night's sleep.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.780]   And you're really like, I'm thinking about this, I'm innovative.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.240]   Other times, like, oh my god, I'm just trying to figure out roughly how I want to get things
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.360]   done.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.040]   So you want the template there to support you.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.400]   It's like you're, I call it a template because you think of it as like, here's my template
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.120]   for the ideal week would have these elements.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   I'm right in the morning.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.680]   I'm not doing too many of these.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   These are meeting days.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   These are non-meeting days.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.520]   Like it's the, it gives you the recipe or the template for what you think for that quarter
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   is going to be an effective week.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.440]   Quarter is the right timeframe to work on this.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   Because things change.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.480]   Like what's relevant for me in the fall will be different than what's relevant to me in
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   the winter.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.560]   And that's true for a lot of other period people as well.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.360]   So your, your, your quarterly plan check is like the right timescale in which to look
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   at these templates.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.860]   Two, you're gonna have to adjust it a bunch, you get super ambitious.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.700]   I'm going to every afternoon, you know, work in the woods and it turns out like that almost
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.700]   never works.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.320]   There's like all these little things I can't avoid that keeps messing up that plan.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.880]   I need to adjust this weekly template.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.160]   That's great.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.560]   Adjust as needed.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:58.480]   Finally, at the end of a quarter, these are a good focuser for reflection.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.360]   If you think back, what about these weekly templates that I like?
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.160]   What about them frustrated me?
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.880]   Like I really wanted to do this and I just could not make that work.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.400]   Gives you, I think, deeper insight about what's working and not working in your job.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.320]   Much deeper insight than just like a typical day.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   You can have busy days.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   You can have non-busy days.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   There could be a deadline where you're overwhelmed and other times you're bored.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:25.000]   But when you think back about your lower timescale, your larger timescale weekly template adjustments,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.240]   I think you get a deeper insight about what you're looking for in your working life, what's
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.080]   working and what's not.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.200]   You love the like, my mornings were for writing.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.400]   Maybe this was like super effective.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.080]   Now you're having some insight of like, you know what?
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.840]   Maybe I'm well suited for like a more self paced, more like what matters is what you
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.580]   produce type job.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.680]   Maybe you're really frustrated that you couldn't make something like that work and it's telling
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.640]   you about, you know, the meeting pace of my job is really incompatible.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.040]   That's what I have to find a way to change.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.440]   That might be changing my role and changing my expectations.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.800]   I think there's great insight that comes from your grappling with your vision of the ideal
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   week.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:08.320]   It kind of lives in this nice sweet spot between the idiosyncratic difficulties of a particular
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.700]   day and the very aspirational big picture visions of like, where do I want to be five
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700]   years from now?
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.240]   It kind of gets that more, what's happening, what's not happening.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.160]   It's getting the trends of your job, not individual days, but also not the two area of images.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.240]   So it's the fall now.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.920]   Figure out your weekly template just to summarize again, the elements that might go into that
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.740]   regularly protected time themes for various days, rules and limits and autopilot scheduling.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.240]   Get one of these figured out for your, your fall ahead.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   It's really good.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.280]   You're going to feel like your weeks are much better, much less exhausting, much more productive
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.560]   in the sense of making progress on the things you care about.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.400]   You're going to be less frustrated.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.280]   It really can make you feel like it has a different job versus the alternative of just
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.480]   like now I'm facing this week.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.140]   It's full of all this stuff.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.760]   I guess this seems fine.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.040]   Let's just go day to day and time block and make the most of it, right?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   It is going to feel like a completely different job, even though you haven't actually officially
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.540]   changed anything about your role.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.360]   So give your weekly template a try.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.000]   I have one specific question and a broader one.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.480]   I guess I'll go with a specific one first.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.240]   When you start your writing, is it usually around 830?
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.840]   Usually it's 830, sometimes it's earlier.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.960]   So ideally two hours?
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   Ideally two hours.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.180]   So if I know I'm ending on the earlier side, I might start earlier, right?
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:37.000]   So we leave, we leave the house to walk the kids to the bus stop at 730.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.840]   And typically my wife and I both walked into the bus stop together because we like to walk
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   back.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.040]   We like to catch up.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.440]   But if she has something early, then I'll just take them.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.120]   If I have something, like if I know I have an 11 or a 1030 meeting, I might just bow
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.280]   out the walking that day and then I could start my writing right at 730 and get that
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.680]   extra hour.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.880]   So it just sort of depends on what's going on.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.080]   And then ideally six days a week or five days a week?
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   Five days a week.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   Six day is needed.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   Okay.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   Right.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   Sunday session is needed.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.120]   Occasionally evening sessions, but I won't get too much in that now because I think we
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   have a question.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   We have a question.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   We have a question.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   So I don't, I don't make right now.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.160]   I'm trying to at least not making the six day regular.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.600]   I would like not to have to do it on the sixth day.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.960]   So I'm going to see if this metronome regular relentless every single morning you're making
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   progress.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   Like I have a sense that's going to add up to in a slow productivity sense that will
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   keep me on pace.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.080]   Well, that's what you do when you wrote slow productivity, right?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.760]   I mean, I, I think I was thinking about using Sundays more.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   So then I helped start at my kid's school, a robotics team and we, we meet on Sunday
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.840]   mornings.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.780]   So like that kind of took out the time I was very, that's, I would often write on Sunday
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.760]   mornings that ate up that time.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.560]   So then last year, like I wasn't writing as much on Sundays as I usually do.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   And so now I'm going to kind of see how that goes, make that more permanent.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.040]   And then my broad question is, does a template look more like a calendar in your weekly plan?
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.720]   Is it more like a bulleted list?
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   The bulleted list.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   Okay.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.280]   So, so my fall template, I call it, um, it's categories and bullet points.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   Okay.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.520]   So it's like, here are my elements of, uh, here are the elements.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.640]   I think I used a wording of like, here's my, the elements of my ideal week for this quarter.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.000]   I mean, I used the word semester cause I'm a professor, but same idea.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.320]   And just put it right at the top of, uh, your quarterly plan because you're looking at that
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.400]   every week.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.280]   And that's exactly when you want to remind yourself of, of your, of your template.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   All right.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   Cool.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.240]   So we've got a bunch of questions that are kind of similarly tactical again, we're following
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.480]   our theme here of back to, back to school, back to work.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.280]   Like let's get our systems tuned up, but before we get to the next questions, let's first
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   hear from our sponsors.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   I'm going to talk first about our friends at ZocDoc.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.560]   You've heard me talk about it before ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.460]   and compare high quality in network doctors, choose the right one for your needs and click
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.600]   to instantly book an appointment.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.040]   We're talking about in network appointments with more than 100,000 healthcare providers
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.640]   across every specialty from mental health to dental health, eye care to skincare and
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.500]   much more plus ZocDoc appointments happen fast, typically within 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.080]   You can even sometimes score same day appointments like ZocDoc solves a pervasive problem.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.480]   I need a medical care provider for X.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.240]   How do I find them?
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.600]   ZocDoc makes this so easily, whether you're using the app or the website, you can just
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.400]   find here are some in my region.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.620]   Let me filter now, which of them take my insurance, it'll tell you which of them are taking new
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.620]   patients.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.880]   It will tell you, let me look at the reviews, the authentic reviews from other ZocDoc users.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.360]   Oh, of these doctors, this one people really like great.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.000]   Now let me use the ZocDoc software to book my appointment, right?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.200]   You're all within the same ecosystem.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.400]   I have several doctors that use the ZocDoc software, even after booking with them, the
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.960]   handle, for example, paperwork, the pre-appointment paperwork, for example, they just have my
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   stuff in the system.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.240]   I can do it online ahead of time.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.280]   I love it.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.320]   I'm actually about to do a lean into ZocDoc.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.120]   My doctor, my primary care physician left.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   So now I need a new primary care physician.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.360]   I've been procrastinating on this because, you know, the book launch or whatever.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.320]   But I'm not worried about how I'm going to do this because I know the right place to
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   start a ZocDoc.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.360]   I can immediately see who's around, who takes my insurance, who's taking new appointments.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Let me look at the reviews.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.140]   I mean, now we're talking about 10 minutes.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.700]   What would have before been me just emailing a bunch of friends and like hoping to find
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.400]   someone who happens to have room, right?
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.080]   So I am a fan of ZocDoc and you should as well.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.520]   So stop putting off those doctor appointments and go to ZocDoc.com/deep to find and instantly
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:06.000]   book a top-rated doctor today that's ZocDoc.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.400]   This show is also sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.440]   We talk a lot on this show about your brain, right?
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.960]   In a knowledge economy, your brain matters.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.400]   Your ability to focus matters.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.440]   Your ability to do deep work matters.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.960]   Your ability to find quiet in a world that has all these digital distraction matters.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.240]   We talk about this all the time, but what we also need to emphasize is that you need
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.360]   a healthy relationship with your brain.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.520]   If you have an unhealthy relationship from your brain, whether this be ideation or rumination
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.720]   or excess anxiety or the anhedonia of depressive syndromes, all these other things are difficult.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.240]   So just like you want to get your body healthy, you want to have your relationship with your
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.080]   brain healthy as well.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.480]   This is where therapy enters the scene.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.640]   You can find a professional with a philosophy that resonates with you, and they can work
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.760]   with you to help you repair that relationship with your brain, that all-important relationship
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.200]   with your brain.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.920]   The thing about BetterHelp is that it makes it easy to get started with therapy.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.800]   If you're thinking of starting therapy, BetterHelp is the right place to start.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   Why?
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.080]   Because it's entirely online.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.160]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.080]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire, and they will match you to a licensed therapist.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.880]   And if you don't think it's a good fit, you can switch your therapist anytime.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.040]   No extra cost.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.000]   So with BetterHelp, the distance between where you are right now and a better relationship
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.400]   with your brain being supported by a professional therapist is quite small.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.320]   It really makes that easy.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.240]   So rediscover your curiosity with BetterHelp.

[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.320]   Speaking of questions, Jesse, let's move on to our questions.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   All right.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.480]   Who do we have first?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   All right.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   First question's from Aaron.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.560]   "In your podcast with Andrew Huberman, you mentioned the importance of a fixed schedule
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.600]   and that you usually like to stop working around 5.30.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.000]   You also mentioned that you occasionally have a 90-minute writing session in the evening
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.400]   when you need to get something written on deadline.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.120]   Is that something you time block in your day ahead of time, or is it the result of overflow
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.080]   work just not getting done during the day?
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.320]   Do you wait until after it's over to do your shutdown routine?"
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   All right, Aaron.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Good questions.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.720]   I'm actually, these days, in my weekly template, I typically aim, actually, now I'm finishing
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.480]   before 5.30 because I'm using exercise as my transition.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   After I do my shutdown routine, I'm using exercise almost every day as my transition
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.840]   from work to non-work.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:01.320]   I find that really helps to have a difficult physical strain, helps reset your body physiologically,
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.200]   not to mention your brain psychologically for life outside of work.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:12.280]   These workouts I'm doing, though, can require 45, 50 minutes, so I'm ending work a little
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   earlier now.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.960]   I like to get going in the exercise when possible before 5, so I'm ending a little earlier.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.320]   All right, so let's get to the meat of your question.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.200]   I do sometimes write in the evening.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.940]   Okay, so how does that fit within my daily time block plan?
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.320]   It's after the shutdown, right, because the shutdown routine is where you're closing all
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.680]   the open loops of your day, you're reviewing your plan for the week ahead, you're convincing
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.920]   yourself that it is fine to stop working, you're not forgetting anything, there's nothing
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.420]   that is urgent that you need to deal with before the next day, and then you either check
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.000]   your shutdown complete checkbox in my time block planner, or you have some sort of catchphrase
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.300]   you say to signal to yourself, "I have reviewed everything, I'm comfortable shutting down,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.400]   we don't have to think about work again."
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.280]   That is still worth doing at the end of your workday, because an evening writing session
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.640]   doesn't require you to have all those open loops open.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.080]   An evening writing session is not checking your email, it's not planning, it's not working
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.640]   on projects, it's not thinking ahead, it's just a singular activity.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.720]   I'm just sitting here and trying to write.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.680]   So I do my normal shutdown.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.760]   The evening writing is like something separate then, right?
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.320]   I don't time block it, because I don't time block after shutdown.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.640]   I don't time block my non-work time.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.520]   I just note, when I do a shutdown for the day, in my time block planner, I just write
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   "evening."
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.560]   I kind of like bullet point below it, like roughly what I remember I want to try to get
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   done that evening.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   I don't time block it.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.640]   So I just note like, "Okay, I'm going to do an evening writing block," and I'll usually
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.720]   coordinate them with my wife and be like, "Okay, so if this works, here's what I'm going
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   to do.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.920]   I'll go to my office or head over to the coffee shop for like an hour, and here's what I'm
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   going to do it."
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.080]   And so it's roughly time blocking, since I know I worked out with her when I'm going
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.760]   to do it, but I don't actually draw a time block, because I don't actually do time blocking
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.960]   in any formal sense on weekends or after shutdowns.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   For me, evening writing blocks are not overflow.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.960]   I don't like this idea that if you don't finish your plan, just keep working.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.480]   That means your plan was probably too ambitious, or you weren't being sufficiently focused
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   during your day.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.440]   I don't like using evenings for overflow, if at all possible.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.580]   I typically use evening writing sessions because I'm trying to break a complicated story.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.480]   So this will typically happen with my New Yorker writing.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.080]   Those are hard articles to get into because the writing caliber is hard.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.000]   The thinking has to be super sharp, but the writing, just the craft, has to be very high.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.100]   It's a high bar of entry sometimes to get into them, so sometimes I like to make a running
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.580]   start at them by writing in a new location at a new time.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:48.280]   So I'm going to BevCo, that's our coffee shop, going in the evening and coming at this
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:53.460]   in a new environment to try to harness some inspiration just to break into the piece.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.000]   Once a piece is going, then it's more workmanlike and you can just schedule it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.060]   So typically that's what I'm doing with my afternoon writing sessions.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:07.080]   If I am behind on a deadline, the thing I'll usually aim for is a long weekend writing
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.200]   session.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.680]   That's more like, "Okay, I need to throw five hours at this thing, so maybe I'm going to
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.560]   stay home and work on this while the family's doing something else, or we'll go to my in-law's
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   house and they have an outbuilding on their property sometimes, so great, I will go out
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.200]   there and write while you visit with your parents, etc."
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.080]   So that's the way I think about that, but good question.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.940]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940]   Next question's from Mark.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.660]   "I'm a new high school teacher.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.560]   I also play in a successful band, so I currently have two sources of income.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.480]   My passion is to start my own business.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.920]   What is the best approach for me to leverage my current career capital to become an entrepreneur?"
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   Well, Mark, I'm suspicious of your use of the word "passion" here.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.160]   When someone says, "My passion is to start my own business," what that really means is,
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.540]   "I like the idea of starting my own business, and I'm going to call it my passion so that
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.000]   you have to go along with it."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.300]   But you're not wired.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.880]   This is my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.560]   You don't have some genetic predisposition for a particular job that exists in the 21st
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   century freelance knowledge economy.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.600]   When you say, "It's my passion," you're just saying, "I'm interested in starting a business."
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.200]   Okay, I'm glad you're interested in that.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.000]   That by itself doesn't mean much to me, right?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.360]   So I don't hear the word "passion" and have that sort of reaction of career genuflection,
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   "Oh my God, you got to do that.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.640]   We got to make that work."
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.120]   The word's kind of meaningless to me.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.520]   So what should we do?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.120]   Lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.880]   We need to have this vision of your ideal lifestyle in a few years, and then 10 years
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   or more out.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.320]   We'll work on those two timeframes.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.760]   This vision has to be holistic.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.040]   It has to capture all the different areas of your life, like what type of place you're
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   living in.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   What's the rhythm of your day?
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.800]   Who are you around?
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   What do you smell?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   What do you taste?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   What do you see?
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   What do you hear?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.200]   You want to build this aspirational vision of the rhythms and realities of your day.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.480]   What is it that you're trying to get towards?
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.880]   And then we can assess career capital you have or career capital that you could obtain
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.000]   and see how it would fit into that lifestyle vision.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.920]   Maybe entrepreneurship works well in here, right?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.080]   You're like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:19.040]   If I do this, I could see a path towards this lifestyle I have that the teaching's not going
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   to get there.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.200]   This is more constrained," or whatever, fine.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.280]   It could play a role in that.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.460]   But I want you working backwards from an ideal lifestyle, not working forwards from something
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.960]   that you've just labeled a passion, because that's rough and it's crude, and it's often
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.480]   working off of a halcyon incomplete vision of what this thing really means.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.920]   I want you working backwards from a lifestyle.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.040]   That's how you do a real career capital analysis.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.680]   You know exactly what you want to invest that career capital in, and now you're saying,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.200]   "Can I get enough career capital?"
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.120]   You're being much more systematic about this.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.000]   When you're doing lifestyle-centric planning in your situation, Mark, a big thing I want
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.680]   you to do is be very realistic about finances.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:06.520]   Figure out, "For this vision I have, how much does it cost?
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.960]   How much am I spending?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   What would the spend be there?
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   What would it get?"
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.960]   Real numbers here, right?
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.760]   This is really empowering for people.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.320]   I'm sort of thinking about this chapter from my Deep Life book I'm working on now, that
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.440]   getting concrete numbers as well as this sense of complete understanding and control over
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.400]   your money right now, and these concrete evidence-based numbers for, "Well, if I lived here, it would
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.040]   cost this much, and I would need this much, and here's how much I can earn doing this
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.400]   and that."
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.040]   Working with real numbers is important because then you can start saying, for example, "Okay,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.280]   if I wanted a small business to support me because then I could be more flexible and
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   live this lifestyle where I'm in the woods all the time," or whatever it is.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.760]   Now you have numbers, and now you could say, "Okay, so I need a small business to generate
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.760]   this much money."
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.840]   Now you can be like, "Okay, is that reasonable?
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.600]   Who's making that much money in these small businesses and why?"
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   And then you can start doing an idea that I talk about in So Good They Can't Ignore
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.560]   You, called using money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.840]   Start seeing on the side, "Okay, well, how much money am I making money?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.040]   I'm selling this product.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Am I making money?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   Am I selling it?
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   Right?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   Is no one buying it?
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   Okay, this is a problem.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   Oh, people are buying it.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   That means there's some value here.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   So I could imagine I would have to 3x this for this plan."
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.800]   So you're getting really detailed about the financial realities, all of it working backwards
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.240]   from an ideal lifestyle vision.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.160]   So I love hearing people talk about, use the phrase "lifestyle" or "ideal lifestyle" when
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   thinking about their careers.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.240]   I get nervous when I hear them say "passion."
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.720]   Passion just means I want to, and I don't want you to say anything about it.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.800]   But I'm not convinced by that.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.160]   So look, some sort of entrepreneurial push here might be a big part of achieving your
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.760]   vision that does give you lots of autonomy, jobs are a way of scaling up income that separate
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   income from time.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.840]   There's a lot of cool options there, but it's also really hard.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.520]   So you want to get realistic about that.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.600]   Also very cool that you play in a band.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   I love that.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.360]   You know, Derek Sivers, so I talk about him in that book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.960]   He talks about leaving his job to be a musician full-time, and then leaving his job as a musician
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.280]   to run a small business.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.920]   So that's my homework for you, Mark.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.760]   Read So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.480]   Find in particular that chapter about using money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.280]   Read Derek Sivers' story because he made exactly these decisions.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.360]   And I'll give you the TLDR.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.840]   He left his job to be a full-time musician once he was making enough money already being
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.280]   a musician on the side to cover his expenses.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.440]   He stopped his performing to work on his company full-time once his company was making him
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.560]   enough money on the side that he could live off of those expenses.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.920]   So he let the money, not his sense of what would be cool, be the indicator of when he
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.280]   was ready to make a jump.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.000]   He then sold that company for like $20-something million.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.280]   So worked out well.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   Interesting guy.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   All right.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280]   Who do we got next?
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.840]   Next question's from Susan.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.800]   I have academic writing that needs to be done for my career.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.260]   I also have creating writing projects.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.280]   Whenever I try to schedule my creative writing, the academic writing takes precedence, and
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.720]   I have time myself that I'll fit the creative writing stuff in whenever I find extra time.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   I do find extra time, but never enough to make real progress.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.400]   I find time blocking for my creative/fun projects is stressful.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.760]   This is where your weekly template's going to be useful because you need to probably
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.120]   pre-protect this time.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.560]   You got to have it figured out, this is when I do academic writing, and I have enough time
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.480]   put aside to feel very comfortable about my academic writing.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.960]   And that's going to be a lot of time.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.920]   And then you're going to say, I'm going to put aside and regularly schedule my time for
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.560]   my fun writing, and it's going to be in a different place.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.200]   And that's where this time is put aside, and that's when I work on my fun writing.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.000]   And there will be less of that because it's not your full job right now.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.160]   What you should not do is what you're doing now, which is approaching your day and saying,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.560]   okay, I'm going to time block my day.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.920]   Do I have time here?
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   What should I do next?
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   Should I do creative writing?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Should I do academic writing?
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.600]   Oh my God, I don't think I've done enough academic writing.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.460]   And once I finish my academic writing, I'm busy, I don't have time for my creative writing.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.440]   This time has to be protected way in advance.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.680]   And you've got to have rituals around it, and it's got to be, here's where I go to do
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.280]   this writing, and it's like clockwork, and I feel bad.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.640]   If I ever miss it, it makes me feel like something's incomplete in my life, and probably it's going
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.760]   to be like first thing in the morning, you're doing academic writing, and then two evenings
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.960]   and one weekend day a week, you have these late afternoon/evening sessions at a coffee
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.920]   shop where you do your creative writing.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.400]   You've got to figure out how to make this regular and ritualized, but protect that time.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.240]   If you don't have that, if you're like, "Okay, but I don't have enough time when I try to
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   do that.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.320]   Like I can't, I don't have, for example, enough time to regularly work on my academic writing
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   and my creative writing."
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.200]   When you try to figure out that time and you can't, there's just not enough consistently
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   free time in your schedule for that to happen, well, now you're confronting reality.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.520]   What we call facing the productivity dragon, "Oh, I'm not fooling myself.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.480]   My schedule doesn't have enough time to do both.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.960]   Okay, something has to change.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.880]   Either I have to put off the creative writing until I have like a sabbatical to just do
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.680]   that, or I have to loosen something else on my schedule."
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.760]   So again, the weekly template, this sort of thinking about like, "When this quarter do
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.200]   I want to work most weeks on academic writing?
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.640]   When this quarter am I going to work most weeks on creative writing?"
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   Forces you to confront the reality of your workload at a scale that tells you something
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.760]   deep about your job.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.440]   On a daily scale, it doesn't tell you much.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.920]   No matter what your job is, you're going to have a busy day.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.300]   But on the scale of like, "I'm trying to find a consistent schedule to do this writing."
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.520]   When you fail to do that, that's telling you something that is consistently true about
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   your job.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.960]   It's a very useful scale to interrogate what's working and what's not working.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.200]   So that's what I would do.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.960]   You should never be thinking, in my ideal world, you never will be thinking on a typical
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:06.600]   day, "Should I do this writing today?" or "When should I do this writing today?"
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.520]   That answer should have been long since established and recorded, and it's like autopilot at this
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520]   point.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.640]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.760]   Next question is from Ari.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.720]   "At my current job, I'm struggling to fit in deep work sessions.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.840]   I have calls starting at 7.30 a.m., which can stretch until 12 p.m.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.600]   I've tried shifting my deep work sessions to after lunch, but I've been unable because
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.800]   I'm already exhausted."
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.000]   Well I can already tell this is like a time zone thing probably, because if he's starting
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.340]   at 7.30 a.m., he's probably like West Coast, maybe working with East Coasters.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:48.840]   So Ari, you're going to have to lean heavily into location and rituals to make afternoon
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   deep work more effective for you.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.880]   It is hard for a lot of people.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.760]   I have a hard time with it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.400]   Most people, here's a reality, most people, if you say, "Hey, first thing in the day,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.080]   get some coffee and work deeply," can do it.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.320]   Like, "Okay, yeah."
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.760]   I don't have too much other stuff in my head from work.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.520]   We're just getting started, so my cognitive context is focused, my attention residue is
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.520]   minimal.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.000]   I have energy in the morning, I'm having my first caffeine of the day, great, let's do
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   deep work in the morning.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.080]   Most people can just do that without too much support.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   The afternoon's a different story, and I include myself in this.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.360]   After we record this podcast, like Jesse, if I just after this podcast were like, "You
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.400]   know what, I think I'm going to go do some writing," and just took out my computer, that
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.840]   would be difficult.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.440]   I would need ritual and location built around getting good deep work occurring in the afternoon.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.200]   So Ari, it's not unusual that that's the case for you as well.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.520]   All right, so what might this mean?
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.020]   I have a bunch of ideas for this.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:51.460]   First of all, I would suggest a half-day shutdown routine after your calls end at noon.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.500]   So give yourself a half hours to close up all of the open loops that were created by
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   these calls.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.240]   Make sure the stuff that needs to be on your calendar is on your calendar, the stuff that
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.600]   needs to go into your capture system is in your task management capture systems, the
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.240]   follow ups are happening, that there's not loose ends from these calls that are still
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   floating around.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.360]   So you really want to sort of shut those things down, take the next step, schedule when things
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.640]   are going to happen, get that out of your head.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.160]   Any deep work attempt with a bunch of open loops from the morning still open is going
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.340]   to be otherwise very difficult.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.580]   I would then suggest having a physical interruption.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.200]   So this could be like going on a long walk on a set route.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.880]   Our canonical example here is Darwin, that is a state outside of London, built the sand
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.100]   walk, a very specific sandline path that went through the most scenic parts of his property.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.760]   And he would do a set number of circuits on that path to prepare himself for writing.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.140]   So it could be this, I'm walking doing this particular walk, maybe to a coffee shop and
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.940]   back or if you live near the woods on a particular wooded trail, exercise, I've become a big
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.940]   believer in this.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.660]   If you have some schedule here, go do some hard exercise midday, it really does reset
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.300]   your energy levels and your brain.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.540]   Now you're ready to switch over to try deep work.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.580]   Keep the deep work period reasonable most days.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:14.500]   It is hard to be on calls from 730 to 12, like you are using a lot of energy.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:19.180]   You cannot on a regular basis and say great, I'll do 1230 to 530, you know, writing the
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.400]   great American novel, you've used a lot of energy.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.060]   So let's go with the slow productivity principle here of slow but steady.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:31.620]   Deep work done really well, every single day, reasonable amount of time that will add up
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.580]   to something good.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.540]   And maybe it takes a little bit longer to add up to something good.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.100]   But my schedule will be if I keep my schedule sustainable, I can keep doing this and over
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.220]   time I'm going to produce lots of cool stuff.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.940]   For chemical interruptions as well.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:50.060]   So I get this special cup of coffee or I make my Monta tea or like something you do right
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.700]   at the beginning of the afternoon deep work session.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.100]   Have a location interruption, go somewhere different than where you did your calls to
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.100]   do deep work.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:04.300]   I think this is worth potentially even spending non trivial money and having notable eccentricities
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   in your day.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.980]   It really makes a big difference to say, I'm going to this shed, I'm going to this library,
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:17.300]   going to this like local university, I am going to my attic deep work room, I'm going
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.840]   to the cabin I built in the woods, whatever it is, change locations for this deep work.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.700]   I've done, I've shut down, I've gone for a walk, I've made my special cup of tea and
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.700]   now I'm going to the deep work only location and then have a fixed amount of time you're
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.700]   working.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.480]   As I said, this is probably not going to be too long most days.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.820]   You should be happy with 90 minutes to two hours.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.700]   That's probably all the energy you have left.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.980]   If this seems insufficient, choose one day at first where you end your calls earlier.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.380]   Just when these calls are being set up, you're like on this day, I'm actually only available
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.680]   till 11 or 1030, right?
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.020]   People like whatever, you're just clear about it.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.920]   Like you're available, we're always doing calls, there's one day where like you're not
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.060]   available for a couple hours at the end, so we just work around it.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.500]   You can do that one day a week, maybe two and have a longer deep work session, but don't
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.820]   try to be a hero here.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.460]   Your brain can only do so much work, especially when is you have this kind of really mixed
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:15.960]   up demanding multi-role knowledge work type of things going on, right?
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.780]   Do those things, regular afternoon deep work as possible.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.620]   Just trust that 90 minutes to two hours, five days a week, four weeks a month will produce
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.620]   really good stuff.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.300]   Even if it's not as fast as you would like to go, it's better that you have a sustainable
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.380]   pace you can slowly move on that over time gets you to the finish line than it is that
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.100]   in the short term, you're trying to go heroic.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.980]   To close the loop here, when you're done with this deep work session, then have like your
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.420]   final end of the day session where you do your real shutdown.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.620]   This is where you can have like, okay, I have admin tasks I need to do, I would do that
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.620]   after the deep work, non-trivial admin tasks, like I got to fill out this form, it's going
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   to take 20 minutes.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.420]   You have your hour and 90 minutes at the end of the deep work session to just shut down
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.420]   your day.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.260]   I would leave that type of stuff, the non-trivial admin to the other end of deep work if possible
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.420]   so that you can get to it before it's too late.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.580]   Again, adjust as needed.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.740]   Different people have different preferences, different rhythms work better, but that's
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.020]   probably how I would do it.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.920]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.660]   - Our next question's our corner.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.860]   - Ooh, slow productivity corner.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.440]   You've missed me saying this for the last two weeks, but we like to have one question
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:29.180]   a week that's relevant to my new book, "Slow Productivity, the Art with the Lost Art of
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180]   Accomplishment."
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.180]   I haven't said it in a while, Jesse.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180]   - I know.
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.220]   - "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Overload."
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.580]   It really is like a source book to, God, 75% of the stuff we talk about on the show.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.740]   If you haven't read "Slow Productivity" yet, you got to go get it.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.060]   Just go get it, read it, recommend it because we talk about the book so often on the show.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.200]   Anyways, here's our "Slow Productivity" question corner, "Slow Productivity" corner question
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.460]   of the week.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:05.140]   "Hi, the question comes from Fenindra.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.900]   I got laid off recently and currently have a part-time job.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.420]   I spend about four to five hours on that to keep up with the bills and rent.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.620]   I have an interview with a big tech company coming up in a few weeks and I need to prepare.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.380]   Is there a way to use the principles of slow productivity to strike a balance between my
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.140]   part-time job and interview prep?"
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:28.660]   Well, let's go back to the principle we mentioned for Ari, a key idea from slow productivity,
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.020]   which is trusting slow but steady.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:38.500]   So doing a reasonable amount of work on a regular basis, trusting that can get you where
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   you need to go.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.780]   This is like one of the most important heuristics from the slow productivity mindset is getting
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.640]   out of the idea of how busy or exhausted I am today is what matters.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.300]   How overloaded I am is what matters.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:57.220]   And instead saying, I want to produce at the bigger scale, stuff I'm proud of.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.100]   How can I do that in a way that's sustainable, that's compatible with a richer life, and
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.900]   it's not going to make me completely fatigued.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.060]   Slow but steady is the way.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.300]   It's like how I write books.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.500]   I write a little bit most days, I let it add up over a year, right?
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.500]   Slow but steady.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.900]   I want to drill in on this a little bit though, right?
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.580]   Because the details matter here for you because you don't have a ton of time.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.580]   You have a few weeks, so you can't get this wrong.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.580]   You don't have the ability, looking at this, you're working four to five hours a day.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.700]   You don't have the ability to just say, I'm going to take a week and just do nothing but
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.700]   prepare for the interview.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.420]   I mean, it's not a bad idea, I guess, if you could take time off your part-time job, but
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.820]   it's a part-time job, so you probably can't.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   But you don't have a lot of room for error here.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.020]   If like you're slow but steady, if you get off to, if it's not very effective, you're
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   in trouble.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.020]   You won't be prepared for this interview.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.180]   You don't have a lot of time to course correct.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.220]   So let me dive a little bit deeper.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:50.020]   Another way to say slow but steady is relentless and deliberate.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.860]   Now, I use this more specific terms to capture the following two important elements to doing
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.780]   the strategy properly in your situation.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.780]   When I say relentless, like it really has to be every day.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:08.380]   A lot of people have a loose definition of what it means to do something regularly, right?
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:14.120]   We can convince ourselves, yeah, man, I'm practicing my guitar on a regular basis.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.020]   But if you actually went through and measured it, you're like, well, I only really played
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.020]   twice this week.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.540]   And the first time, you know, I was just sort of like jamming along to a song.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.820]   And really, if I do the math, I had about 15 minutes of actual practicing in that week.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.780]   But in your mind, you're like, I picked it up on several occasions, right?
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.980]   We're easily deluded.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.020]   We can easily delude ourselves into thinking we're doing something all the time.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.140]   So you have to defeat that by being relentless.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.900]   No, no, I do this every single day.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.480]   Here's the time I do it, tired or not tired, you know, whatever it takes, like this is
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   I do it every single day.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   So you have to be relentless.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.500]   Otherwise, you're not going to have enough results to aggregate.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.880]   The second term I introduced there was deliberate.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.520]   And I'm drawing here from the phrase deliberate practice, right?
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.680]   Our best framework for understanding how people get good at complex activities is attributed
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.400]   to the late Anders Ericsson.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.760]   Deliberate practice says, okay, if you want to get better at something, you have to stretch
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.800]   yourself past where you're comfortable in a very specific targeted way.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.840]   What is the thing that I need to do better?
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.520]   Let me design an activity to do right now that does nothing but push me on that so that
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   I'm stretching my ability to do that piece.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.700]   This is particularly important for learning, which is what you're trying to do and preparing
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.840]   for the interviews.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.840]   You cannot waste any of these sessions.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.320]   They have to be designed to deliberately improve you exactly in the areas you need to improve.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.000]   Do not waste an hour interview prep session kind of reading stuff on Reddit.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.800]   You need to actually be on the LeetCode website, doing the exercises right now of a type that
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.520]   you're not quite comfortable with, giving it your full attention, trying to figure out
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   how to make them work.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.280]   If you don't have that sense of cognitive discomfort or stretch, you're wasting the
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.080]   time.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.800]   So relentless and deliberate.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.320]   Every single day, not wasting a minute of those blocks.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.280]   Now, the blocks don't have to be that long.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.040]   It could be 45 minutes to an hour a day, five days a week.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   It's not that much time and it's spread out over a few weeks.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   You will get really, really good.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:14.280]   I think this is actually going to be long-term a great experience for you because after you
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.240]   nail this interview, which you will if you're relentless and deliberate, and you get this
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:25.360]   other job and now you have a senior development job, so you have this kind of big flashy knowledge
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.800]   work job.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.220]   You will remember how this went and you will start thinking, "What are all of the other
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.640]   things in my job, now that I have this big new fancy job, where if I mastered this, it
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   would be really useful.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.880]   It would give me a huge leg up.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.880]   It'd be really impressive.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.120]   It would open up more options."
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.280]   And you'll have this confidence of, "I can learn that without having to make some major
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.000]   change to my schedule."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.680]   That if I just devote 45 minutes a day, and maybe I just do this over lunch hour, five
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.480]   days a week, and I'm deliberate in terms of what I do in that time, there's no limit
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.040]   to what I can start picking up.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.120]   And now quarter after quarter, you're building up all these skills, you've mastered this
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.840]   new API, you've mastered this new programming language, and this stuff is going to add up,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.380]   your career capital is going to pile, you're going to start making some investments with
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.700]   that capital, and your life is going to get somewhere really cool.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.740]   So I mean, this is a great general tip.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:20.200]   If you're relentless and deliberate, a small amount of time each day can add up to something
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.060]   that I think is very impressive.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.360]   And that is a key Slow Productivity Principle.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.240]   One I think that deserves hearing the Slow Productivity Corner music one more time.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:38.960]   All right, do we have a call, Jesse?
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   We do.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   Here we go.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.960]   Hello, Cal.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:48.560]   I've resonated a lot on the topic of seasonality.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.940]   I'm a writer and a producer for a football podcast.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:57.160]   So February through July looks very different in my line of work than August through January.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.280]   And I know for a lot of people, that's similar in the academic world.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.000]   In the offseason, I found so much joy scheduling deep work hours in the morning, spending time
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.720]   with my family, implementing shutdown rituals, and ultimately giving myself space to think
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   and write.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.120]   It was a joy.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.460]   I gave myself some buffer over the last month.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:23.760]   But how do you protect yourself in season from being reactionary and ultimately being
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.340]   a mile wide, but only one inch deep?
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.340]   Thanks, guys.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   All right.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.340]   Well, thanks, Kyle.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.480]   Kyle has a football podcast.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   Is this Kyle Shanahan?
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.840]   I don't think Kyle Shanahan has time for a football podcast.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.480]   He probably goes on a podcast.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.520]   He's not spending six months a year writing, just taking deep work time in the morning.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.620]   He probably does a lot of deep work, but there's a lot of film breakdown and stuff.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.040]   I've dealt with a non-trivial number of professional sports franchises.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.520]   They care about deep work.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:57.920]   But I will tell you, the busiest people I've met have been professional sports GMs.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   Really?
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.720]   Because the GMs in particular have all the concerns of the product on the court or the
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.640]   field, but also management concerns, staffing concerns, budget concerns.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.200]   Those are crazy jobs.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.720]   I'm saying, Mike Rizzo, I feel your pain.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:21.920]   And I'm still waiting for my invite to come teach deep work principles to all those, the
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.120]   Hope Road, to those young players.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.100]   All right, Kyle, let's get into this.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.640]   So look, I'm in the same place.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   Oh, man, I love my summers.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.280]   I love my summer schedule.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.600]   My summer schedule just ended, my wonderful summer schedule where I write a half day
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   every day.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.080]   I only have any scheduled appointments or meetings on my calendars Tuesday through Thursday
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.080]   afternoons.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.680]   And man, those schedules are fantastic.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.840]   It's painful to go back.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.880]   You got to make sure, though, that you have just as much of a plan for your busy seasons
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.900]   as you do for your easy seasons.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.440]   It's fun and easy to make a plan for the easy seasons because you have a lot of time and
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.440]   not a lot to do.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.840]   And like you could just say, I want to write all day, all my meetings only on Tuesdays,
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   like everything's possible.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   It's a pleasure to build those plans.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.200]   It's way more stressful in the busy season because like your plans don't work.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   I can't do this.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.880]   I can't write every morning and I have to do this and this.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.400]   You see your schedule fall apart and it can be really stressful, but you got to stick
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.080]   with it.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.760]   And in particular, what should you be, what's probably missing from your brew here is what
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.400]   we talked about in the deep dive, a weekly template.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.160]   Like that's probably what's going to help you here.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.640]   If you're already doing, you know, multiscale planning, et cetera, right?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.240]   You're not running around just completely reactive.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.840]   You have capture systems, you're doing multiscale planning.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.040]   Your weekly templates are going to make your stand to gain back some autonomy over your
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   time.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   All right.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.080]   We're going to do this, but here's the days we record the podcast.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.520]   I'm treating those differently than days.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   We don't.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.360]   I'm consolidating all of these meetings.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.440]   Like one big thing we're doing on Thursdays.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.680]   I'm taking these two things off my plate because they're destroying my schedule and they're
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.960]   getting in the way.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.920]   Like this is where the weekly template is, where you're able to exert some autonomy.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.280]   I think it's really important.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:06.200]   I think that aspect of this is really important because what happens is you can be organized
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.120]   but also feel out of control.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:15.280]   And what I mean by that is, you know, we talk about all the time on the show, contrary to
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.160]   the interpretation of the anti-productivity crowd that think that any interest in being
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:25.460]   organized is all about just being co-opted by late stage capitalism, coercive influences.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.460]   Like we say, no, no, no.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:33.360]   To be non-organized, to not have your work captured in context capture systems, to be
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.120]   doing no planning on your time, to be just sort of like stumbling through your days.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.760]   That's what puts you at the mercy of other forces.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.040]   It's going to make you miserable.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.080]   You're going to work harder than you want to work.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.080]   Everything's going to be worse.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:50.000]   Like the step from completely disorganized to organized is a big one, but it's not the
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   full step.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.160]   And this gets to Kyle's issue, I think, because you can be completely organized.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.720]   I know what's on my plate.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.120]   I plan my time carefully.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.640]   I get the most out of my time.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   I've shut down routines.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.080]   I don't let my work follow me home.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.960]   Like you'd be doing all the things and be really upset because you feel like your schedule's
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   not yours.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.720]   You're juggling your time really well, but mainly what you're doing is just juggling
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.920]   all the balls that people are chucking at you.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.880]   You're preventing them from falling, but it's way too many balls to be juggling.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.640]   That's where the weekly template, this is where you can really gain some autonomy of
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   your schedule.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.680]   You begin saying, I'm not just going to say, my goal is to juggle every ball they're throwing
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   at me.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.080]   It's going to say, I only take two balls this day, and this day is three, and this day I'm
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   not juggling at all.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.120]   It's where you begin to get some autonomy back of your schedule.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   It's where you step from being organized to also being somewhat in control over what these
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.360]   organized days feel like.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.280]   So Kyle, it's a pain after a light season to make a busy season work because it's so
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   much harder.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.840]   But it's worth doing and let the weekly template maybe be the main tool that you're adding
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:50.920]   to your toolkit this particular busy season, and I think that'll do much better.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.080]   All right, we got a case study here.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.960]   It's where people write in to talk about their experience, putting the type of things we
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.720]   talk about on this show into practice in their real lives.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.920]   If you have a case study to share, you can just email it directly to jessie@calnewport.com.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   She's organizing those.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.360]   All right, today's case study comes from Colton.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.880]   Colton says, I have been a devout New Portonian since high school, and I followed your advice
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.400]   on time block planning, autopilot schedules, and deep work throughout college.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.440]   Once I began my service as a Peace Corps volunteer in Zambia, however, I encountered a lot of
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.200]   problems.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.820]   Transitioning from my cushy college life and into my first real job and the harsh living
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.800]   conditions of rural Zambia was brutal.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.240]   I have no electricity, running water, toilets, or stoves.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.280]   It took a year for me to figure out how to get things done in this part of the world.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:48.720]   Surprisingly, most of your advice about knowledge work applies to my work as a Peace Corps volunteer.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.780]   Each morning, I read over my Google Calendar and quarterly goal project list and use them
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.640]   to build a time block plan for the day.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.600]   I manage my recurring tasks with an autopilot schedule that blocks off specific times each
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.140]   morning to do my research and writing (I worked for a remote cancer lab back in the U.S.).
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.400]   I handle my non-recurring tasks with a project list that I can pull from each morning.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   Because I work on one task at a time without any distractions, I can finish all of my work
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:17.840]   by 1pm and still accomplish a ton of projects in my village, like building a medical waste
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.940]   incinerator for my local clinic and publishing a few papers in medical journals.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:26.200]   Well, Colton, I appreciate the case study and I appreciate your use of the word New
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:31.000]   Portonian, which I really hope to spread.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   Let me highlight something from this case study that I think is important.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.440]   I mentioned this in the call as well.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:43.860]   There is this sense out there that to care about personal productivity, again, is somehow
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:49.800]   a negative or maybe like a necessary evil of certain like super high-powered, like corporate
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.560]   high-paying jobs, but for the most part, it's just internalized capitalism in its worst
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.480]   sort of form and it's something that those of us who are more socially conscious and
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.240]   self-aware, we want to dirty ourselves with.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.340]   This belies that belief.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.920]   This is literally someone in the Peace Corps in Zambia building medical incinerators and
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.760]   working on cancer research.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.540]   Being organized makes that possible.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:17.800]   Being organized means he can, with complete focus and presence, starting at 1pm every
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.960]   day, just be working in that village while also still making progress in the morning
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   on the other things.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:28.740]   It's making his ability to be effective, even under really harsh circumstances, possible.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:33.480]   This is what I like to see personal productivity skills deployed towards.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:40.200]   It allows me to deploy the image of the ideal life that I have in mind.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.800]   He doesn't use the word here "optimize."
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.160]   He doesn't use the word here "maximize output."
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   He does not use the word here "hustle."
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.560]   He does not use the word here like "production machine."
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:57.040]   No, he has a vision of what would be a sustainable-feeling, meaningful vision for my life, and he realized
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.000]   if he cannot control the incoming streams of what needs to be done and information and
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.800]   task requests in his life, if he can't handle that, if he has no control over his time,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.560]   he can't get to that vision.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.920]   Those visions don't have to be heartless.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.120]   Those visions don't have to be mechanistic.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   It doesn't have to be one of Blake's mills rendered in flesh in the personal individual.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.960]   It doesn't have to be Gordon Gekko, right?
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   It's more neutral than that.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   You control yourself.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   You can control your life.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.120]   What you do with your life is up to you, and most people actually want to do more interesting
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.840]   things than just try to optimize or maximize output.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.240]   So Colton, I love it.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.000]   It's a great case study.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.120]   We're productive so that we can produce our ideal lives, not the highest possible production
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.120]   rate possible.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:45.720]   All right, so we got a final segment coming up, but first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.960]   I want to talk about our friends at Notion.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.160]   You've heard me talk about Notion before.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.580]   It combines your notes, your docs, and your projects into one space that's simple and
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.320]   beautifully designed.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:02.280]   What I like about Notion, and I've said this before, is you can build these sort of custom,
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.060]   really easily, these basically like these custom information storage and retrieval systems
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.840]   that fit exactly the type of work you're doing.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:14.560]   A big proponent of customized systems to get you away from the hyperactive hive mind of
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:20.220]   we're just like attaching Word documents to emails and rock and rolling all day long.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:25.040]   Systems allow structured collaboration, structured encounters with information.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.420]   This allows much more sustainable, effective work.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.680]   And Notion, I love the way they do it.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.440]   We've worked before with like a really cool setup with our ad agency where we could see
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.600]   using a custom Notion setup, all of the advertisers, and we could switch views of like where's
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.320]   all the times we've done reads for this ad.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.200]   Let's put in information about this particular read.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.840]   Now let's zoom out and see all the different reads happening this week.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:53.580]   You can build fantastic things easily, whether it's for a complicated business or just organizing
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.120]   your own stuff as an individual.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.160]   What they've been doing more though, and I want to emphasize this in this read, is that
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.720]   they have been now integrating artificial intelligence into the product itself just
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.640]   to make it even easier to use.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.480]   Notion AI helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger doing tasks that normally
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.640]   take you hours in just seconds, right?
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:23.540]   So we're talking about things like generative AI style text creation, like, hey, can you
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.080]   write a first draft?
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.000]   Can you summarize what I am saying here?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.320]   You can automate tedious tasks, like, okay, great.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.280]   Summarize these meeting notes that we can enter it over here in this information, and
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.480]   it can help you find things, right?
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.720]   Because it understands your information and it makes it easier for you to find things.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:47.000]   Notion is used by over half, it surprised me, half of Fortune 500 companies, right?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.360]   I didn't know that was true, but now that I hear it, I say, of course, it makes work
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.560]   systems easy.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.960]   Teams use Notion send less email, they cancel more meetings, they save time searching for
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.440]   their work and reducing spending on having a bunch of different types of tools.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   All of this helps keeps everyone on the same page.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:14.100]   So try Notion for free when you go to Notion.com/cal, do this all in lowercase letters, Notion.com/cal
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.600]   to try the powerful, easy to use Notion AI today.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.200]   When you use our link, you will be supporting our show.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   That's Notion.com/cal.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.880]   I also want to talk about our friends at Ladder, L-A-D-D-E-R, look, we've been saying follow
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.160]   us the time you get your act together, you get organized, you fix the stuff that needs to be
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.400]   fixed, you get ready for the new year, the new school year, the new post-summer vacation year.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.320]   The one thing that you might be procrastinating on, if you're like a lot of people, is life
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.120]   insurance. If there's people who depend on you, you need life insurance, not just some life
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.560]   insurance, but enough that would actually take care of them if the unthinkable actually happened.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.880]   So why do most people not have enough life insurance who know they need it? Because they
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:04.200]   don't know how to do it. Where do you go? Who do you talk to? Is it hard? Is it too expensive?
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:10.840]   This is where Ladder enters the scene. Ladder is 100% digital. You need no doctors, no needles,
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.800]   and no paperwork when you are applying for $3 million in coverage or less. You just answer a
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:21.320]   few questions about your health in an application. You need just a few minutes and a phone or laptop
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.640]   to apply, and then their smart algorithms work in real time, so you'll find out if you're instantly
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.280]   approved. We're talking no hidden fees. You can cancel at any time, get a full refund if you
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.520]   change your mind in the first 30 days. These are policies that are insured by insurers with long
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:44.440]   proven histories of paying claims. We're talking those that are rated A and A+ by AMBEST. Look,
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:52.600]   insurance only gets more expensive as you age, so the right time to get more life insurance
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.680]   is right now. This is also the right time for me to have dropped my ad page on the ground,
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:06.360]   but I picked it up. I'm going to do a good ad lib here, Jesse. Much in the way that I was able to
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.080]   pick up this page from the ground, you can pick up your need to get more life insurance for the
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.960]   people you love with Ladder. So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:30.280]   approved. That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep, ladderlife.com/deep. All right, let's do our
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.360]   final segment. All right, this is our first podcast of September. Oh, it makes me sort of sad.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   I mean, I like the school year because my kids are in school, but my summer schedule is so nice.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.080]   Oh man. And Jesse, I've mentioned to you, I have like an administrative role.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.880]   I know. You told the audience too. Did I? Oh my God. It's fine. I'm building systems,
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:58.440]   my weekly template, man. I'm like Cal Newport Dean. The Newportonian vibes is strong, my friend. My
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.360]   Trellos are smoking because they're being used so much. I'm on it, but man, I miss the summer.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.040]   All right. So it's first episode of September. So we'll talk about the books I read in August. Hey,
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.520]   before we do though, a listener, was it Zach? Yeah.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.240]   Sent us, me and Jesse, custom hats for the show. So I figured we'd do this final segment
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.440]   in the hats. If you're a listening set of watch, you can check this out on YouTube.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:32.600]   There we go. There we go. Looks good. Yeah. Looking great here. All right. So for those
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:39.320]   who are listening, we have on stylish VBLCCP trucker hats. Of course, we know what that means.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.040]   Value-based lifestyle centric career planning. That is the way that we hear
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.640]   the deep questions podcast. Think about career choices. These hats are awesome.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.280]   Yeah. I mean,
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:58.520]   I'm not a fashion guru, but I think these look pretty sharp. It does. It kind of seems
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.960]   like we're probably, you know, these hats are from our time spent running like a state committee in
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.560]   the old Soviet union. Just looking at these abbreviations that this is probably some sort
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:15.240]   of like Russian abbreviation for like the state crop distribution, socialist republic, you know,
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.760]   advisory committee, but that's cool. It's kind of like a retroness to that. All right. So we're
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:27.400]   going to, we're going to harness as VBLCCP energy as we do the books I read in August, 2024. All
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.560]   right. This first one's a little weird, Jesse. I'm just going to preface this by saying I, my wife,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.760]   right. We're on vacation. She was reading it. We were in the woods somewhere. I was like,
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:42.040]   I'll read that. It was a Emily Wilde's encyclopedia of fairies written by Heather
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.480]   Fawcett. It's a fantasy book, I guess, maybe like a little bit of a romance book, but not,
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:53.240]   I don't really know these genres very well. I actually liked the first two thirds in particular,
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:58.600]   like the, it's a alternative timeline world. I couldn't really tell when this took place.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.280]   I finally found some clues that it must've been 20th century or equivalent because they mentioned
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.560]   movies at some point, but it's kind of like a timeless, uh, it's a professor. It posits a world
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   where fairies exist and it follows a professor who is like, who studies fairies. Like they,
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.640]   this is just a subject that people study. And she goes to like this small, uh, town in a country
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.000]   that doesn't really exist up in Scandinavia somewhere like in, in, um, stuff ensues.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.760]   I actually kind of liked the world building because I'm a professor of there being a whole
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.600]   academic discipline that studies like these beans and it's a little bit dark and a little bit,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   whatever. Um, I thought it went a little bit, look, I'm not a big novel reader. So take this
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:43.720]   with a grain of salt. Uh, once it actually got past, like, you know, we're, we, we see hints
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.120]   of this. We're kind of studying this once they're actually like, we're in a fairy world. I felt like
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.200]   it was just whatever, anything goes and everything's magic and whatever. Right. Like, you know, then
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.760]   that, that kind of lost me, right. That world building lost me, but I thought it was, I enjoyed
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.120]   it. I don't read a lot of books like this. I didn't realize all these books always have like
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:08.440]   a romance core too. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Um, so she's her fellow professor who spoiler alert
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.800]   is part magic or something. They, you know, uh, I love her. I thought it was good though. I thought
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:19.400]   it was good. All right. Then I read any, uh, Annie Jacobson's book, nuclear war, man, there's a book
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:26.120]   right there. I love when nonfiction writers do something different with form and format and what
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.960]   Jacobson did is a compelling book. It's a hard to put down book. She basically did a bunch of
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.640]   research, a nonfiction book. I think Amazon, I think Amazon chose that, you know, they have their
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.040]   best of the best books of the year so far. And you know, slow productivity was chosen as the
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.720]   best business and leadership book of 2024 so far. I think this was chosen as the best just overall
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:56.440]   nonfiction book of 2024 so far. What she did is a lot of research on, uh, what is the U S is actual
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.200]   like nuclear war plans and procedures and protocols. Like how does this work? Who makes the
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.960]   decisions? Where are the various people? What happens if this gets blown up? Where are the
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   missiles? And then the book just walks through, it takes place largely in like 12 minutes. It
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.240]   walks through global thermonuclear war breaking out from the point of view of like the American.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:22.040]   Okay. So this person, we see this on the radar and the president goes here and then these get
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.880]   blown. Then this happens and we fire these missiles and, and, and the whole world gets
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.160]   blown up in the end. So it's like a really kind of scary book, but she's really trying to nail
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.040]   the details straight of like, here's how this would work. Here's the, you pull out this caper,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.480]   you would type in these things. These people at this base underground here would be involved in
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.960]   this. And she works the whole thing out. Spoiler alert. It does not go well for us in Washington,
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:47.080]   DC. So we get hit by a thermonuclear warhead early on in the book and where we are right
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:53.160]   now, we're not going to do well. Our skin would catch on fire. So this would not be good for us.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:08:01.240]   There was one, I got a nitpick. There's one nitpick where I was like, this doesn't seem,
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.800]   well, okay. I have two nitpicks. Okay. By the way, my family did terribly in this.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:14.840]   So the, the first two missiles hit Washington DC where me and my two sisters live. The second
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:24.120]   missile hit the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility in central California coast. My brother works
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   at that nuclear power plant. So the first two missiles killed my whole family. We didn't do
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.280]   well. We didn't do well in that book. All right. Here's my two nitpicks. One, so it's mainly very
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   well-researched, but I can tell the parts where she glossed over. One, when she went to the
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.480]   boomer class, the missile subs. So our missile subs fired missiles at the end, right?
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:51.400]   She, so these would be like an Ohio class, probably a missile sub. I know a lot about subs.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:57.480]   My brother was on subs. She talks about when the, the order comes in for firing the missiles,
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.600]   that alarm bells start wailing on the sub. That's missile launch time. It's missile launch time.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.400]   There's, they don't do alarm bells on subs. The whole point is that the sub is supposed to be as
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.080]   quiet as possible. They wear sneakers on these things just to try to make sure that like their
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.240]   footsteps make sound. They're not going to have a klaxon bell sound to tell the submariners it's
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.440]   time to fire missiles. They would, because the whole point is you fire these missiles and are
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.200]   supposed to go back under and not be detected. So that was not true. And the other thing I didn't
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.840]   understand is the president's on Marine 2, right? So it was on the, or Marine 1, the helicopter,
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.560]   right? And they're rushing away from the White House to try to get to Mount Storm because they
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.440]   know the, the missile's coming for the White House. And he's, there's a particular secret
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   service team that's with them that's responsible for getting them there. And they're, they're doing
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.880]   the math and be like, we're not going to get, I don't think we're going to get far enough away
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.520]   from the explosion for like, at least the electromagnetic pulse is going to, might take
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:58.120]   out this helicopter. So what do they do? Like, we're going to put a parachute on the president
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.280]   and one of the secret service members and we'll jump, we'll parachute out over Maryland.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.080]   Well, here's my nitpick. Why not just land a helicopter? Why not just like, what we'll do
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.760]   is we'll just land a helicopter on a field. And, uh, if it does disable us, it's better that we
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.080]   landed the helicopter than we parachuted the president out. And if it doesn't, we can take
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.080]   off again and keep going. Like, why would you parachute out of the helicopter? Because you
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:29.240]   were worried that, why not just land a helicopter? So I didn't, that, that part, but it was,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.560]   I read this book in one day. So it's, it's a. I don't have to borrow it.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.400]   Yeah. I'll, I'll lend it to you. It's a cool nonfiction experience. Um, all right. A less
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:46.280]   good experience. Oh, go Crichton estate. I read, I regret to inform you, Eruption by,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.920]   I'm putting big quotation marks around this, by Michael Crichton and James Patterson.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.000]   Michael Crichton has been dead for like 20 years now. They're still miraculously discovering books
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.640]   he started and other people are finishing. So James Patterson, uh, ended this book. This could
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.880]   have been, this would have been an awesome Michael Crichton book in his prime. It's about a, a, a
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.440]   volcano, uh, on Hawaii is going to have this big explosion and like they're dealing with
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.920]   the volcano science and supposedly Crichton had started working, like interviews using the
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.760]   interviewing volcanologist. Like he really was trying to understand it, but in the hands of
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.680]   James Patterson, which means in the hands of the people that James Patterson has anonymously,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.160]   right. His books, it was just terrible. Really? Oh, just terrible. The science was incoherent.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:35.000]   The space was incoherent. You couldn't understand what was going on. It didn't matter. Nothing made
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.040]   sense. I didn't know who the characters were. I didn't care. It was, uh, some of the most like
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:45.080]   wooden, like old fashioned, like weirdly, like paternalistic, misogynistic characters. It's
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.520]   like all the women just love this guy for no real reason. It was just a really poorly written book.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.080]   Now I have to read it because I'm a Crichton completist. And I, I decided long ago that, um,
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.800]   his post, uh, post-death books, uh, posthumous books, I would count those as trying to read
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.960]   every Crichton book because I thought there would be like two. They keep finding these things.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   They keep finding, I read the pirate book. No one else read the pirate book that he supposedly
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.480]   started writing. Like they're not, anyways, it was not a good book. Do you ever go on like
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:19.240]   Reddit threads about this? I should. I'm thinking about, I don't know if I mentioned this to you.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.360]   I'm thinking about putting on the wall as we renovate the maker lab portion of the HQ, um,
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.200]   putting first edition Crichtons on the wall. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah. It's like motivation.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.200]   All right. So I had to get the taste of that out of my mouth. So I picked up literally at a,
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:39.880]   uh, grocery store book rack in upstate New York. I grabbed the latest Lincoln child, uh,
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.640]   thriller Diablo Mesa, because they know what they're doing. Lincoln and child together.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.200]   They write it's, it's just good thrillers, right? Not necessarily innovative, but just good
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.360]   thrillers. Diablo Mesa was great. It was like, this is just what I wanted. Well-constructed
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.920]   took the bad taste of eruption out of my mouth. Um, and then I finished by reading, uh, Gwendolyn
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.160]   bounds is book. Not too late. There's a book. Uh, it's good for us, Jesse. It's about, she got
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:09.960]   heavily into, um, adventure obstacle course racing starting in her mid forties.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.520]   And it's now like podium places in our age group, like is really good at it. And the book is about
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.120]   like this, like middle age is not, is not too late to actually get like heavily involved in like a
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:30.680]   really involving potentially even physical activity. Golf. Yeah. And not as rare as obstacle
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.160]   racing. I liked it though. I know I liked it because it's like written for me. Right. She's
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.600]   like a couple of years older than us when she started this. She's in her fifties now. I was
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.440]   like, yeah, I should, I should, uh, cause you know, a partial, like anyways, I, I thought it was
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:51.400]   good. She's a good writer. Um, and, uh, it was inspiring. Like, yeah, you should. Yeah. I have a
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.960]   good buddy who got really into that too. Um, he's a little older than us, but younger than her got
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.240]   really into obstacle racing. Right. Um, because it's something you can kind of get into if you
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:08.920]   really train, like they have age groups. Um, it's not so professionalized too, that it's like the
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.520]   genetic freaks are going to win it. Right. Like it's, you have a chance. And he built all the
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:19.080]   obstacles on his property and had installed in his office, the, um, the grip related hanging
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.160]   things on his ceiling. So he could just practice. He got really good too, but then had like a gnarly
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.800]   injury. Like, I don't know what he sent me the photos. Don't send me this, uh, compound fracture,
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.960]   like just, uh, gnarly. And I think he's not, he didn't, he never got back to it. He fell off
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.200]   something and who knows? I'm reading a book about rowing right now. So I'm, I'm, I'm flirting with,
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.360]   maybe that's a good midlife move. I just saw boys in the boat. Yeah. George Clooney directed that.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:50.600]   Oh, he did. Yeah. Uh, I'm reading David Halberstam's the amateurs about the Olympic hopeful
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:58.920]   American scholars in the 84 Olympics. Um, reminds me of my halcyon days as a Dartmouth rower,
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:06.440]   except for these guys are in better shape than I am. All right. Anyways. Uh, that's all the time
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.360]   we have for today. Thank you, Zach, for these awesome hats. I'm going to, I might wear this
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.760]   a couple of places. You think it's too declarative? Like people are gonna be like, well, if it was
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.240]   smaller, you, it might be more willing to wear it more often, but it was just declarative. You're
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.040]   kind of putting in people's faces. I think it's kind of what you say about the Russian, you know,
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   it does corn farmers, right? Because the, the CCP or the final letters of the, the Russian name for
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.840]   the Soviet reunion, Soviet union. Yeah. I still appreciate it. Thank you, Zach. All right. We'll
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.400]   be back next week with another normal episode of this podcast. Summer's over. We're back in it.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.280]   Um, we will see you then. And until then, as always stay deep. Hey, if you like today's
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.680]   discussion of the weekly template, check out episode two 99, which is about our love hate
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.640]   relationship with personal productivity. I think it's a great addition to this conversation.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:03.240]   Check it out. So eight books and around 3 million sales later, I wanted to look back at what I've
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.480]   observed up close over this period about our culture's changing relationship with the topic
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.680]   of personal productivity.
