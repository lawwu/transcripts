[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   You might not like me for including this question.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.120]   No, I want you to ask someone to tell me why.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   Someone asked, "Are you aware of the Never Swing the Rock memes about you?"
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.340]   No, I'm aware of the little Michael "Never Swing the Rock" Porter Jr.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.800]   I don't know who came up with that.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.960]   But to be completely honest, getting a lot of assists is not my role on the Nuggets.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.220]   Joker and Jamal, they play their two-man game.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.900]   If it gets swung out to me by one of those guys, I'm expected to shoot it.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.600]   I'm one of the best shooters in the league, like, humbly, like, I can say that.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.100]   But, like, I don't see contests.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.940]   So, a lot, you might be watching it on TV and see me shoot a contested shot,
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.740]   but it doesn't feel contested to me.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.200]   I might watch it, like, after I'm filming, like, "Yo, I shot that."
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.460]   But really, they don't feel contested.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.740]   But I'm, I'm, I definitely, I see it.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.540]   But really, I'm not, I'm not the one with the ball in my hands like I was in high school.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.420]   You know?
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.960]   To win a championship, every player on a team has to have a specific role.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.040]   And for me, it's like, when I, when I catch the ball, it's, it's, let it fly.
