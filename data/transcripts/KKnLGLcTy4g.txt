[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   You might not like me for including this question.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.120]   No, I want you to ask someone to tell me why.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   Someone asked, "Are you aware of the Never Swing the Rock memes about you?"
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.340]   No, I'm aware of the little Michael "Never Swing the Rock" Porter Jr.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.800]   I don't know who came up with that.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.940]   But to be completely honest, getting a lot of assists is not my role on the Nuggets.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.220]   Joker and Jamal, they play their two-man game.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.860]   If it gets swung out to me by one of those guys, I'm expected to shoot it.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.560]   I'm one of the best shooters in the league, like, humbly, like, I can say that.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.980]   But, like, I don't see contests.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.700]   So, a lot, you might be watching on TV and see me shoot a contested shot, but it doesn't
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700]   feel contested to me.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.080]   I might watch it, like, after I'm filming, like, "Yo, I shot that."
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.460]   But really, they don't feel contested.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.380]   But I'm, I'm, I definitely, I see it, but really, I'm not, I'm not the one with the
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.500]   ball in my hands like I was in high school, you know.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.380]   To win a championship, every player on a team has to have a specific role.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.080]   And for me, it's like when, when I, when I catch the ball, it's, it's, it's let it fly,
