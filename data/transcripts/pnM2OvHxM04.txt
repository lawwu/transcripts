[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Each week we get tons of questions from our audience
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.800]   on personal finance, investing, taxes, markets, crypto, financial planning, everything in
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   general. This show answers those questions. Remember, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.220]   Today's sponsor is AcreTrader. AcreTrader allows you to invest in farmland across the
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.800]   country. One of the benefits of investing in farmland, while it has little to no correlation
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   with stocks and bonds, does have a positive correlation with inflation. Duncan, this
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.400]   week on Animal Spirits, we were talking about maybe inflation is going to be a little stickier,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.280]   a little higher, 4 to 5 percent, potentially going forward. Maybe this is kind of one of
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560]   those things. We haven't had to worry about inflation in a long time, and farmland is
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.320]   one of those things. Remember, AcreTrader makes it easy to simply invest in professionally
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.420]   managed farmland. So visit AcreTrader.com to learn more and to learn more about the
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.480]   risks involved. That's AcreTrader.com/company/terms. Duncan, you and I were on the road this week
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.720]   in Texas. We were, yeah. Speaking of inflation, we kind of made the point that before there
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.120]   was like New York and maybe LA inflation and then everywhere else, when you go to restaurants,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.040]   bars and such, it seems like that just permeates the whole country now. Everything's kind of
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.520]   just expensive everywhere these days. Yeah. No, I bought a thing of whole bean coffee
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   at a coffee shop near the hotel. It was $20. Okay. That seems fair. See, that's why I don't
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.240]   drink coffee. But that's like Brooklyn prices. That's what I would pay in Brooklyn. Yeah.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880]   This is Houston, you know? Yeah. It is just interesting how long until the consumer revolts
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.240]   because it doesn't seem like anyone minds. Every flight I was on, everyone, "Get on quickly.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.880]   Stow your stuff up top because this flight is full." People are still spending money.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.000]   I wonder when we're going to start fighting it. Anyway, let's do some questions.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.080]   Cool. Yeah. Thanks, everyone in Texas. It was a good time. It was my first time in Texas.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.800]   I thought everyone was nice, had a good time. Nice weather.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.960]   It was fun. Yeah. Everyone was very nice down there. It was great.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.480]   Yeah. Okay. First up today, we have a question from Yajur, I think is the best pronunciation
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.680]   I can do. "Hey, guys. Love the show. Question for you. People are saying that the bond market
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   is screaming recession. Has the bond market ever been wrong? Any notable examples? If
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   so, why was it wrong?"
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.560]   The bond market generally is known to be smarter than the stock market. But yes, the bond market
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.760]   gets it wrong. You don't have to go back very far in history to figure this out. The bond
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.560]   market totally missed inflation, much like most people. The bond market did not see this
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.420]   pandemic-induced inflation coming just like the Fed. Think about it. At the end of 2021,
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.920]   this is less than a year ago, the 10-year treasure was still yielding 1.5%. By that
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   point, inflation was already 7%, going higher. So the bond market was completely off sides.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.740]   And I think that's one of the biggest reasons we've had this huge adjustment in rates this
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.080]   year is because the bond market had to play catch-up. Now, you could blame the Fed for
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.480]   that stuff, right? The Fed was telling us all that inflation was going to be transitory.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.160]   It wasn't going to last very long. It wasn't supposed to stick around at these high levels
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   for this long. So maybe the bond market was taking its marching orders from the Feds.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.840]   But I guess if you're in the camp that rates are all manipulated by the Fed and the Fed
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.200]   is doing all this stuff, can you really look to the bond market to be this predictor of
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   what's going to happen in the economy? I don't know. I think it can be helpful to understand
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.160]   what causes yields to change in bonds in the first place. So sure, the Fed controls short-term
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.080]   yields, right? But that's only on the very short end of the curve. You also have to think
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.640]   of things like supply and demand for bonds and based on investor demand for those. And
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.160]   there are inflation expectations and expectations for future Fed moves, expectations for economic
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.240]   growth and maybe some price yield trends that's going on if you're a technical trader, I guess.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   I think if you add all this up, one of the things that's confusing for people who don't
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.960]   pay attention to the bond market is, you get bond yields moving, but they don't always
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   move in the same direction at the same magnitude, right? So John, throw on the chart of 10-year
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.560]   Treasury yields versus 3-month T-bills. So this is over time. You can see directionally
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.800]   they're fairly similar. So 3-month T-bills are essentially, think of them as like savings
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   account yields. It's kind of a good proxy for the Fed funds rate that they use to sort
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520]   of do monetary policy by raising and lowering rates. But this is like a savings account
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.200]   yield, or a CD rate. You can see right now, at like 4.3%, 3-month T-bills are yielding
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   almost 80 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury yield. That, we talked about in an
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.320]   inverted yield curve last week. In terms of risk and reward, that shouldn't make sense
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.200]   where ultra-short-term, 3-month, government-backed T-bills, which mature in a very short period
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.560]   of time, shouldn't yield that much more than something that goes 10 years out on the risk
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.360]   curve, right? So this is not normal. The hard part here is the Fed is effectively inverting
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.120]   the yield curve, right? They're raising short-term rates, and the long end of the curve is saying,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.720]   "I don't care," right? Because the Fed is trying to snuff out inflation. So is the bond
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.480]   market predicting a recession, or is the Fed simply going to cause one? It's kind of like,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   is the bond market really doing stuff here, or is it really just the Fed saying, "No,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.440]   no, no. We're showing you we're going to do it, because we're raising short-term rates"?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.360]   It's also interesting to see how the yield curve has changed over the past year or so.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.120]   So, John, throw this next curve up. This is a one-year difference in 3-month T-bill yields,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.400]   2-year Treasury yields, 10-year Treasury yields, and 30-year Treasury yields. You can see that
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.120]   the longer-term bonds have moved up. The 30-year went from 1.9 to 3.5 or so. The 10-year again
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.080]   went from 1.5 to 3.5. But look at how much. 3-month T-bills, this is a year ago, not that
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.880]   long ago, went from basically nothing, 7 basis points, to 4.3%. Even 2-year Treasuries went
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.200]   from less than 70 basis points to 4.3%. So we've had a huge move in the bottom. There's
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.160]   been slight move up in longer-term rates, but not nearly as much. And so, I guess the
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.240]   yield curve could be telling us a bunch of different things. We don't know. It can't
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.920]   communicate. But it could be saying, "The long end of the curve doesn't believe inflation's
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.880]   going to be here to stay." Which, if you think the bond market is smart, yeah, maybe we believe
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.680]   them, but is the bond market really that smart? I don't know. Traders maybe assume the Fed
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   is going to have to cut rates in the next 12 to 18 months, right? That's why those longer-term
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   rates aren't moving down yet, or are staying put, because they don't believe that the Fed
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.800]   is going to keep rates this high. And again, the short end of the curve is maybe helping
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400]   the Fed orchestrate retirement, because that's all they can do, or recession. Retirement,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.200]   yeah, that'd be fun if we could retire the Fed. Because that's all the Fed can do to
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.560]   slow inflation, right? So, I don't know. Maybe economic growth is going to slow in coming
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.800]   years. That's what the bond is telling us. And maybe just we should realize that predicting
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.880]   the future of the economy in the path of growth and inflation, interest rates, and all these
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.760]   things is really difficult for the bond market or the Fed. So, my biggest reservation about
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.000]   using the bond market to try to predict what's going to happen in the economy right now is
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.560]   just that the Fed is so involved in these markets. And I don't know if the bond market
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.400]   is telling us something, or they're just doing what the Fed is telling them.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.780]   In general, do you think, are bond people having like a renaissance right now? Are they
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.920]   just like rolling up in a Rolls Royce and getting out with sunglasses on? I feel like
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.520]   they have to be feeling good these days.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.920]   Well, not yet, because if you look at past performance, bonds have gotten killed this
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.520]   year. Going forward, they should be doing better, because rates are finally higher,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   but-
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.800]   I just mean for years, it was like no one cared anything about bonds, and now everyone's
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   talking about bonds.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.040]   Yeah, to your point, we've been mentioning this for a few weeks. We get tons of questions
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.640]   on bonds these days. We got another one in this very episode. But yes, I just think,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.020]   I don't want to argue with historical relationships, but I also think that the Fed being so heavily
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.380]   handed and involved here makes it much harder to understand what's going on.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.360]   Yeah. Yeah, I find it all confusing, and that's a good segue to the next question, because
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.340]   ... Yeah, this one and the third question, actually. I find a lot of this bond stuff
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.340]   a little confusing.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   Let's do it.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.900]   Yeah. All right. Up next, we have a question from Jacob. "My wife and I just got married
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.740]   in September. We both have good jobs and are trying to save up for a new house in the next
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.980]   few years. We currently have $50,000 in savings for a house, along with a $10,000 emergency
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.500]   fund, which we hold at a local credit union in a savings account at a 3% yield. We are
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.520]   wondering if short-term, three- to 12-month T-bills yielding between 4.25% and 4.75% would
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.340]   be a better option than a high-yield savings account for these funds."
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.060]   Another question we received for years and years in a low-rate environment was, "We're
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.820]   saving up to buy a house, but there is no yield anywhere. What do we do?" Savers of
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.020]   the world can finally rejoice. There is finally somewhere to put your money, and you have
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.180]   multiple options. The great thing is, there's not only yield again, but it's yield on the
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.780]   short end of the curve, because if you're trying to match that down payment in a house,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.020]   say, like I have three years until I'm going to buy a house, or two years, you can match
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.060]   those assets and liabilities and match the time horizon of when you're going to do this.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.100]   If you bought a three-year treasury today, knowing that you're going to try to buy a
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.860]   house in three years, you could essentially set your maturity date for then, and it takes
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.140]   a lot of the risk off the table.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.980]   I actually think for the first time in a long time, young people could have a better chance.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.260]   If you have a good credit score and you have a down payment saved, in the coming years,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.500]   I think you're going to have a chance to have much better negotiating power for a home,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.580]   and maybe much better price action, if prices do fall 10%, 15%, 20%, like some people think
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.860]   they could. I think if mortgage rates just came down to, like, 5% or so, it would make
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.140]   things a lot better for people. And if they don't, if they stay in the 6% to 7% range,
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.200]   the prices are going to have to come down.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.080]   So I think, again, if you're waiting in the wings now, it might not be as good of a time
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.380]   as it was three, four, five years ago, but I think it's going to get better.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.420]   So as far as where to save that short-term cash, an online savings account is going to
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:30.660]   be easier. I use Marcus. I'm getting 3% right now. That should hopefully be 3.25 or 3.5
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.100]   by the end of the year, because the Fed is going to raise rates at their meeting next
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.780]   week again. They said probably another 50 basis points, maybe 75, if they want to get
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.820]   it. 3% is not bad. So you have this person has $60,000 in savings, right? That's what
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.820]   they say, $50,000 and then $10,000 in emergency savings. That's $1,800 a year in interest
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.100]   at 3%. If we get to 3.5%, we're talking more than $2,000 a year. That's pretty good.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.500]   Now, to their point, short-term treasuries can earn a higher yield right now. I looked
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.300]   at the average maturity on the one to three-year treasury ETF for iShares. It's 4.3%. If you
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.980]   go to the Vanguard short-term bond fund, I think that actually has some more corporates
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.740]   than all governments, but that's 4.8%. So with those kind of yields, we're talking more
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.820]   like $2,600, $2,900 a year, if those rates stay the same. That's pretty good. Now, the
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.020]   thing is, these yields, it's not like they just get to a level and then they stay there.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.740]   But if the Fed's going to keep raising rates and try to fight inflation, those short-term
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.300]   rates should stay higher for a little longer, assuming the Fed doesn't destroy the economy
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.700]   and then have to lower rates just to save us again.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.540]   I talk a lot about the tolerance for complexity on this show, and I think that probably comes
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.500]   down to ease of access here. So in an online savings account, you might get a little bit
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:42.620]   lower yield, but it's super easy to transfer in and especially transfer out. It's not that
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.700]   bad if you have to go to a brokerage account, but if you're buying these short-term treasuries
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.980]   or treasury ETFs, you have to go to the brokerage account, you have to put the money in, then
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.500]   you have to make the purchase, and then you have to make the sale, and then you might
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.540]   have to wait a couple of days for the trade to settle to get your cash out. So it's not
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.500]   the end of the world, but it's one extra step to get that extra yield. I honestly think
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.020]   either route probably makes sense these days. You could maybe even split the difference
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.380]   and have a little bit in each, because if rates do start moving, and treasury yields
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.300]   are moving different than the Fed funds rate or the savings rates, you could maybe go back
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.540]   and forth to one another. I just think once you pick whatever route you're going to take,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.580]   I would just stick with it and not try to go back and forth and earn an extra 10 basis
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.900]   points here or 20 basis points there. In the grand scheme of things, that's probably not
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.460]   going to matter much. The good news is, you already know how to save. This person has
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.900]   $60,000 saved, they're well on their way to having a healthy down payment, and if and
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.900]   when home prices drop from here, they could actually be in a pretty good position to buy.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.700]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, let's hope so. For those of us that don't own homes yet, it would be
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   nice to see this.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   This is you potentially, right Duncan?
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.700]   Yeah, right, yeah.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.740]   So if you're saving for down payment now, what would you feel more comfortable doing?
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.380]   Honestly I would probably Google the highest yielding stocks and buy those and lose half
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.900]   of it by next year.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.980]   So you would take dividend stocks for your down payment?
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.060]   Yeah. I'm just telling you honestly what I would probably end up doing, but yeah.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.940]   You can lead a horse to water. You know, here's the thing. I don't mind having some stocks
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:11.380]   in your down payment fund, but I would right size it and maybe put 20% in there, 30% because
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.300]   you just don't want those stocks to crash right when you need the money and go from
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.580]   I'm going to have $70,000 for a down payment to wait, it's $60,000 because I had one awful
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.820]   month in the stock market.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.460]   Right, yeah. Yeah, in all seriousness about the question, I would probably be more likely
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.260]   to have a savings account just because of what you're saying, the convenience factor.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.420]   It is, it's easier. Now you have some yields.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.060]   You're kind of paying a fee for convenience I guess, right?
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.500]   Let's do another one. Yeah, I didn't even realize we did the first three ones are all
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   about bonds here.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.580]   Right, yeah. No, I'm learning a lot today.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   All right.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.180]   Okay, so up next we have a question from Mitch and this is the most confusing thing to me.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.700]   I keep saying bond math. I don't know. Maybe you can make it make more sense.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.940]   In the past I hesitated to allocate to bonds since you get killed on principle while collecting
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.860]   low rates of interest. Now that we've got a substantial allocation of bonds or a more
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.460]   substantial allocation of bonds than ever before, I'd like to get more clarity on the
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.620]   impact that rate changes have on principle value. For instance, if rates double, does
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.260]   that mean the principle has dropped in half? I think it would be helpful for people to
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.620]   better understand the scale of value changes with rates to get more comfortable with the
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.020]   risk or benefits of future bond value changes.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.140]   Great question on the basics of bonds that most people either didn't know, didn't want
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.020]   to know, or maybe didn't care to learn about until this year. All right, so the first things
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.620]   to know about bonds and prices and bonds and rates. There's an inverse relationship between
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.580]   bond prices and rates. John threw up my handy Tom Cruise here. Easy. Inverse, right? We've
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.140]   been using a lot of inversion lately. Tom Cruise explains it the best.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.600]   So there's an inverse relationship, meaning when interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.700]   When interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This makes sense. Let's look through a simple
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.100]   example, Duncan. So let's think about the relative attractiveness. If you own a 4% bond
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.980]   right now and rates go to 5%, your 4% bond has to be worth less if you want someone else
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.140]   to buy it because you can get 5% of the market. So you're going to get less interest, so you're
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.380]   going to have to charge a discount if someone wants to buy that to give them a higher implicit
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.660]   rate, right? Now let's say rates go to 3%. Well, now your 4% bond is going to be worth
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.540]   more relatively because you have a higher rate. So people are going to give you a premium
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.820]   for that bond, right? So it makes sense when you think about it in terms of the rates that
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:23.700]   you could get, right? Now the real question is how much do bonds fall when rates rise?
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.420]   That's what everyone wants to know, right? And this is getting into a little bit of nerdy
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.980]   bond math territory, but I think it can really help set expectations if you're buying bonds
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.540]   for your portfolio. So duration is this number that measures the relationship between bond
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.420]   prices and yield changes. It's expressed in years, right? So you'll see 8-year duration.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.780]   And it's typically pretty close to maturity of a bond, but not exactly the same thing.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.180]   It basically takes into account the maturity of the bond, but also how long it takes to
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.500]   get your money back. Because if you're earning a yield, you're technically going to get your
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.420]   money back before the end of it, right? That make sense? Okay. So the most important thing
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.300]   you need to know about duration is the higher the number, the more volatility in your bonds,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.620]   all else equal. So let's say you have a bond portfolio with a 5-year duration. What this
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:07.180]   tells us is that you can expect a 5% change in price for every 1% change in yield. Yield
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.420]   goes up 1%, you should expect your bond to roughly go down 5%. Yield goes down 1%, you
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.140]   should expect your bond to go up roughly 5%. It's not exactly that, but it's pretty
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.780]   darn close. There's some other intricacies involved in here, but that's the gist of it.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.140]   Okay. So higher duration means bigger drawdowns in a rising rate environment and bigger gains
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.500]   in a falling rate environment. John, let's do a chart on a zero coupon bond to show an
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.500]   example here. This is the extremes. Zero coupon bonds are all duration because you don't get
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.820]   paid income over time. You buy it at a heavy discount and you get paid back your principal
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.540]   at maturity. So there's no regular income payment. So zero coupon bonds are literally
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.940]   all duration. This is the 25 plus year PIMCO one. You can see it's rallied lately, but
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.420]   it's down 34% this year. That's more than the stock market. And then we compare that
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.300]   to one to three year treasuries that are down 3.8%. So again, higher duration when rates
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.580]   rise is going to get smacked way more than lower duration, which makes sense because
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.420]   one to three year treasuries have like 1.9 year duration, right? So they're not getting
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.460]   hit as bad. Now the other side of this can be seen in the first six months of 2020. John,
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.220]   do the next chart. This is the first six months of 2020. Zero coupon bonds were up more than
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.340]   30%. One to three year treasuries were up 3%. This is like two sides. It's two sides
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:22.580]   of the extreme coin and it's rarely going to be this much extreme involved, but that's
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.700]   the trade off here. So the question for you as an investor, I don't think there's a right
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.180]   or wrong answer, but it's do you want to accept more volatility in your bonds when rates fall?
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.320]   You want to get bigger gains and rates rise, you're going to get bigger losses. Or do you
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.180]   want to like try to predict how they will work in the economy if rates are going to
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.660]   fall because economic growth or the fed or recession, then you want to like go on along
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.380]   into the curve to get more bang for your buck. Or if you're worried rates are going to rise,
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.220]   then you're going to go in shorter term and you want to be more tactical. Or do you just
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.700]   want more safety and predictability? Do you want to take the volatility out of the equation?
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.580]   My way of thinking about it personally has always been I'm going to accept volatility
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.180]   where I'm getting paid for it and that's in the stock market. I don't want to take much
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.660]   volatility in the bond market, but it really depends on what you're trying to get. What
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.220]   do you think? How's my explanation here, Duncan? I mean, I feel like the Zach Galifianakis
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.180]   gif with all the numbers flying by me. Again, the biggest thing you need to know is that
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.220]   the duration tells you. So if it's a 10-year duration and rates go up 1%, you're probably
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:22.380]   going to lose 10%-ish. That's your relationship. So if it's a 50 basis point move, you're going
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:30.180]   to lose 5%. That's kind of the relative relationship. Okay. I think I got it. I think I'm getting
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.060]   it. So if we go into recession and interest rates get cut in half here, long duration
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.060]   bonds are going to do much better, right? Because they have a much higher duration.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.260]   Got it. Let us know, Mitch. Let us know if that explains it and helps you understand
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.820]   it. All right. Let's do another one. Okay. Up next we have a question from... Actually,
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.500]   I'm not going to save your name in case this question makes them have an awkward conversation
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.700]   with their wealth manager. Okay. Long-time listener of Animal Spirits. I'm 49 with three
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:03.140]   kids, retired and married. For all intents and purposes, I'm rich-ish. That is comfortable
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.620]   but can't afford a yacht. I hired a wealth manager and he brought me this fund of uncorrelated
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.820]   assets with a 10-year walk up. I trust my manager implicitly, but he claims that it's
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.260]   exclusive and not everyone has access to this private equity fund. I think I'd be better
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.180]   off buying Vanguard ETFs, but for what it's worth, he's a professional wealth manager
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.340]   and I'm just another guy on the street. I don't know if he means on the street or like
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.620]   the street. You know what I mean? I think just a guy. Okay. Guy on the street. Someone
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.740]   in the comments here asked how I have three kids and a house that's so white. You know
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   those magic eraser things? I'm constantly washing the walls here. Fingerprints, crayons,
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.940]   everything. Is that like a long call for Procter & Gamble or who makes those? I don't know
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   who does make them. It's got to be one of those consumer staples, but yeah. Or OX. Yeah.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:54.060]   I get those every three months from Amazon because I go through so many of them. Internet
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.220]   down in my office today. I was down hard. No internet when I got to the office. They
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:04.620]   canceled my account for some reason. I said this week I'm not feeling so great about AI.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.700]   It took me 45 minutes to get a person on the phone. AI doesn't understand. Talk to an operator.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.980]   Talk to an operator. I just say it over and over again until someone talks to me.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.700]   Right. Yeah. That's the future, but I like the Christmas vibes. I appreciate that.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.500]   My wife is big into big decoration. Okay. My view here is that there are a lot of ways
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.940]   to be successful as an investor. I have my way of doing things, but I'm not delusional
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.940]   enough to think that my way is the only way to invest. Having said that, if you're going
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.780]   to see through a long-term investment plan, you have to be able to understand what you're
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.980]   doing and why you're doing it. We get a lot of questions about hiring an advisor. I think
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.260]   you can outsource your investment plan and your financial plan and your portfolio management,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.940]   but you can't outsource your understanding. Let's actually bring in a financial advisor
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.820]   because I think this is better for someone who's working with clients on a daily basis.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:57.180]   Alex Palumbo. Hey, Alex. Hi. How are you? Alex, you've implemented a lot of plans. You've
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.980]   worked with a lot of clients. You've talked to a lot of prospects. Now, one of the big
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.380]   things for us at RDWM is fit, and that's fit between the client and our way of doing things
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:11.040]   and then our way of doing things and the client. I mean, if someone comes to you and wants
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.120]   you to do something for them that we simply can't or won't do, how does that work? Alternatively,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.520]   you have a client who comes to you and they say, "I just don't agree with the way that
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.360]   you invest, but I still need a financial advisor." How does that work and how do you work through
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:32.560]   those sort of challenges? Yeah. It's interesting when people want to work with a financial
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.840]   advisor or a financial planner and then don't want you managing their portfolio or they
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.800]   don't trust the things you say. It seems like a very non-mutually beneficial relationship.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.200]   Like, "Why are you going to pay me money for advice that you don't then take?" Regarding
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.920]   this particular listener, I mean, first of all, 49-years-old, three kids and retired,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.680]   rich-ish. I don't know a lot of 49-year-olds that are retired with three kids that are
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.720]   in fact rich-ish. Very impressive. Just because they don't have a yacht, yes. No, to be honest,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.440]   that is impressive. So we could assume that you're listening to Animal Spirits. You're
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.260]   somewhat financially savvy, you would say. I mean, these illiquid investments are like
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.480]   the bane of my existence as someone who previously worked in the broker world selling a lot of
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.760]   these typically subpar products. And listen, it's exclusive. Not everyone has access to
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.820]   it. It's a private equity fund. He's probably right, but that exclusivity doesn't necessarily
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.520]   mean better outcomes. And you're paying a steep premium for it in the fact that you
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.360]   can't touch this investment for 10 years. So if you trust your wealth manager and you
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.880]   like to add diversification to your situation, then it's most likely fine with a very small
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.480]   portion of your portfolio to take that leap into the private equity fund. However, within
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.360]   the financial plan that you're monitoring with your financial advisor, I would categorize
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.960]   this investment as not funding goals. So don't rely on using any of these funds towards the
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.600]   achievement of your financial goals. You're essentially increasing variance in an attempt
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.080]   to hit home runs, which is fine if you understand the risk-reward relationship.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   Right. And you know if it's a 10-year lockup, and sometimes these private equity funds,
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.240]   I know from experience, can extend and be way longer than 10 years. It could be 15,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.720]   20 years to get all your money back. And so understand, you're right, that this is untouchable
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.360]   money for a long time. So if you're retired at a young age, you're not taking in Social
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.520]   Security yet, you're living off your investments, where else is that liquidity coming from?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.960]   And do you have the ability to take 5%, 10%, 15% of your portfolio and put it in something
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.680]   liquid and still have the ability to fund your lifestyle in the meantime?
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.880]   You know, we have products that, not products, we have strategies we offer clients that very
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.760]   small portion of their overall portfolio, "Hey, I think this could make sense for your
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.200]   particular situation. Definitely not mandatory. What are your thoughts?" But then we have
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.480]   our core bread and butter strategies that saying, "Hey, when you become a client, these
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:07.720]   are the 1, 2, 3 strategies that you are going to utilize inside of these accounts. So this
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   isn't like a buffet. You can come and get anything you want because that's a very nonproductive
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.480]   relationship in my opinion. So there's a difference between like small percentage of your assets.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.640]   Let's try to hit home runs, but we're not going to mess with the bread and butter, the
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.360]   core competency of how you and your family are going to grow your assets over time and
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   achieve your goals."
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.640]   And I do think, not trying to like, you know, take out this guy's advisor here, but if you're
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.560]   saying, "I think I'd be better off with Vanguard ETFs and this advisor keeps pushing private
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.400]   stuff and illiquid stuff because they're exclusive and all this other stuff." I think that's
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200]   at the point where you start having a conversation with someone else, just see what else is out
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.800]   there because if it's really not something that you can stick with, even if it's a great
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.080]   investment and it's not going to work for you, like it's not suitable for you, then
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.240]   you're never going to be able to stick with it and you're going to want to leave eventually
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.720]   anyway. And by the way, breaking up with an advisor with a bunch of illiquid stuff in
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   your portfolio, as Alex you can attest to, is not an easy thing to do. It's much easier
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.760]   to cut bait when you have a more liquid portfolio.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.680]   Yeah, that is brutal. I interpreted this question as, "I already own a high percentage of Vanguard
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.760]   ETFs. Now he's coming to me with this little portion of my portfolio that maybe I should
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.840]   use in this private equity fund." But if your interpretation is correct, Ben, and this guy
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.480]   is talking negatively on Vanguard ETFs or recommending a very high percentage in this
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.200]   investment, then I think that's a much bigger issue and you should not proceed with using
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   this advisor.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.400]   Right. Okay, let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.040]   I have one follow-up, one new boil question maybe, but what's the point of a 10-year lockup?
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.440]   Why would you be okay with that?
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.840]   Well, it's a private equity fund, so that's just an illiquid fund structure that you're
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.160]   going to be investing in these things. And they assume by the time you buy into some
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.800]   of these investments, turn them around operationally, and then have some sort of liquidity event,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.240]   it's going to take 10 years probably.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.040]   Okay, okay. So they just don't want to be pestered after three years about getting money
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.560]   back when it hasn't had a chance to do what they're trying to do with it?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   Okay.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.560]   Duncan's like, "Why would I need 10 years of a lockup in an investment when I can lose
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   all my money in Oatly in six months? I don't really understand."
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:14.840]   When I can lose 40% in a year, why do I want a 10-year lockup? Okay, so last but not least,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.400]   we have the following. "I'm in my mid-20s and just got my CFP. I've been an advisor
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.560]   for a couple of years now, but I'm having trouble relating to our firm's clients since
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.920]   most of them are retired or approaching retirement. I'm worried they don't trust me since I'm
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.840]   much younger than they are, and I don't have a ton of experience. Do you have any advice
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.120]   for a young advisor?" Well, we actually do.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.640]   Great, great question. Alex, I'm not sure you know this, but I look a lot younger than
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   my 41 years of age, right? I have three kids, and I go to the store and I still get carded
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   sometimes.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   Do you really?
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.640]   On occasion.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.440]   That's got to be flattering at this point.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.800]   One of the first meetings I ever had with Chris Venn and one of our clients that reached
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.720]   out when I first joined Ritholtz was a guy in his mid-50s, and he kind of made the point
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.240]   to both of us immediately that, "I don't know if I can handle this age difference because
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.400]   you guys are so much younger than me." It can be tough because there is a huge difference
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.520]   between experience and expertise and all these things, but a lot of people you come into
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.400]   contact with who have the most money are going to be older. Alex, you came to us at, what,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.480]   24 years old? Is that about right?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.360]   Yeah, I was 23 when I first started here.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.080]   23. How did you navigate that as a young, up-and-coming advisor and then building a
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   book of business?
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.720]   Yes. Well, now that I'm old and crusty and in my 30s, I can give a very seasoned answer
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   to this question. First and foremost, I did a previous interview with the one and only
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.080]   Josh Brown on this exact topic, which you can see here, being a younger financial advisor.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.460]   But yeah, it's actually a really good question. I think it's pretty nuanced, to be honest.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:54.880]   First and foremost, I would say to this listener's question, your clients are not your friends.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.000]   They're paying you for a very serious service that you should be efficient and adequate
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.320]   in delivering. So when you mentioned I'm having trouble relating to them, to me, it makes
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.780]   me think you're viewing your relationship in the wrong context.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.720]   Now I'm very close with a lot of my clients. Some send me yearly holiday cards, not going
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.940]   to give out names. A lot of them send me wedding gifts when I got married. We are very close,
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.400]   but this closeness is not based on us watching the same TV shows or having the same friends.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.840]   It's based on the mutual respect of our financial planning relationships and then adding in
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:36.400]   layers of humanity, personality, and bonding based on this core financial planning concept.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.520]   So first and foremost, you have to understand their perspective. Trust me, when you're 50,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.400]   60, and 70 to this listener, and you're going to be talking to 25 year old, you're going
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.600]   to be thinking they're like your kids or even worse, your grandkids. But your job is to
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.040]   have such a deep level of competency and technical expertise that these prospective clients or
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:02.080]   your clients are forced to look past your age because your age is not what defines you.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.640]   To Ben's point, a 55 year old broker could be doing terrible work for their clients for
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.360]   30 years, and a phenomenal advisor can be doing exceptional work for your clients for
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   five years, and in a vacuum, you'd want the 25 year old every time.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.480]   Do you think the remote work thing actually works in a young person's favor when you're
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.440]   not having to sit across the table from someone, and it's a little harder to tell the age gap
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   or experience it?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.860]   That's definitely so. When I first started here, we didn't even do like Google Meets.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:42.440]   It was all phone calls and screen shares. And I did feel that helped me a lot as a 23,
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.720]   24, 25 year old advisor because I still look kind of young. So they couldn't see that.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.460]   I do think that helps a lot. One other piece of advice, you have a team on your side, right?
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.280]   It's okay to leverage your team and say that you don't have all the answers yourself from
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.120]   an investment management perspective, from a portfolio allocation perspective, from a
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.280]   tax insurance estate perspective. You have people in your firm that should have decades
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.360]   or combined decades of experience, and it's okay to leverage that.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.300]   Yeah, I think that helps make a lot of people more comfortable if they know that there's
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.580]   a team behind you. Here's our tax expert or insurance expert. It's not just me. I'm your
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.080]   first level of communication and I'm your relationship manager and all these things
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.360]   and I'm helping you to plan, but there's more people here than just me.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.180]   And like me, I'm here. I'm always happy to help, you know? Portfolio construction.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.240]   To be honest, I've probably spoken with the most prospective clients out of anyone that's
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.760]   31 years old that's in this industry. Thousands of people. And I can count on my hands.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.240]   That's a not to brag right there, Duncan.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.880]   Yeah, that's definitely a not to brag.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.440]   That's a not to brag. I've talked to many, many people. I can count on the amount of
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.300]   hands, the amount of hands that I have, the fingers on my hands, the amount of people
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:01.340]   that have actually said, "Hey, you are too young. Let me chat with someone more experienced."
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.740]   And you know what, Ben Carlson and Duncan Hill, we do that, of course. Make sense? Yeah.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.700]   Chat with Gary, chat with Bill. Not one of them have become client because if someone's
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.420]   coming into that meeting with this preconceived notion about it, they're probably not the
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.500]   best fit. And the second thing that I'll add is there are certain clients or prospective
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.440]   clients who think the opposite. Hey, I want to work with someone who's younger, more eager.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.900]   They're in the new school of advisory work, not going to shove me in some investment unit
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.500]   trust. I like the ETFs, the new school way. So don't always project some of those insecurities
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.300]   even though some of them are real.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.980]   And that comes back to our first question about fit. And it's going to figure out if
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.260]   you want to work with that person or not, it's a two-way street. So also, I just wanted
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.780]   to say, Alex, I've never seen Duncan in a worse drawdown than we went to a nice restaurant
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:58.340]   in Houston and the maitre d' told him to take off his hat. There's no hats involved.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.900]   Yeah. I probably would have left if I wasn't with all of you guys.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.340]   He was in an immediate bear market, immediate bear market.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.940]   One time we were in the office and Duncan didn't have his hat on and Cameron looked
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.900]   at him and he goes, "Is Duncan wearing a wig?"
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.340]   Yeah. No one knows what my hair looks like.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.220]   All right. Thanks, Alex, for joining us again, offering your expertise as a more seasoned
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.980]   advisor now that you have a beard.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.900]   I know. I always had the beard. Thank you so much for having me. May I make a quick
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:29.060]   plug, a product placement? Compound water, tastes like Barry, for the intellect, for
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.740]   the trader, for the daredevil inside you.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.220]   All right. Don't do that again.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.140]   Hold that bottle up a little closer so people can see. It's a real thing. We actually made
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.140]   a ...
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.060]   This is Compound Water, Ben. Did you know this?
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.060]   A listener.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.060]   Yes.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.380]   A listener is like a bottle of water person. Yeah, we made some bottles.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.380]   May or may not cause you to wear deep V-neck spandex style.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.380]   All right. If you're listening in podcast form, leave us a review. Remember, leave us

[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:18.100]   Bye-bye.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.100]   Bye-bye.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.100]   Bye-bye.
