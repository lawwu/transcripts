[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Back then, it really wasn't possible to continue working in robotics because there was so little
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.640]   data.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.920]   Like back then, if you wanted to do a robot, if you wanted to work in robotics, you needed
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.080]   to become a robotics company.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.360]   You needed to really have a giant group of people working on building robots and maintaining
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.800]   them and having.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.880]   And even then, like if you only, if you're going to have a hundred robots, it's a giant
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060]   operation already, but you're not going to get that much data out of them.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.920]   So in a world where most of the progress comes from the combination of compute and data,
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   right?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.600]   That's where we've been, where it was the combination of compute and data that drove
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.040]   the progress.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440]   There was no path to data from robotics.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.640]   So back in the day, when you made a decision to stop working in robotics, there was no
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.960]   path forward.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.120]   Is there one now?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.200]   So I'd say that now it is possible to create a path forward, but one needs to really commit
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.140]   to the task of robotics.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.200]   You really need to say, I'm going to build like many thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.460]   of thousands of robots and somehow collect data from them and find a gradual path where
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.560]   the robots are doing something slightly more useful.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.720]   And then the data that they get from these robots, and then the data that is obtained
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   and used to train the models, they do something that's slightly more useful.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.680]   So you could imagine this kind of gradual path of improvement where you build more robots,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.280]   they do more things, you collect more data and so on.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.960]   But you really need to be committed to this path.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.560]   If you say I want to make robotics happen, that's what you need to do.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.280]   I believe that there are companies who are thinking about such, doing exactly that.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   But I think that you need to really love robots and need to be really willing to solve all
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.560]   the physical and logistical problems of dealing with them.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.720]   It's not the same as software at all.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.740]   So I think one could make progress in robotics today with enough motivation.
