[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.840]   the Gospel according to Saint John in the first chapter in the 16th verse.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.860]   The 16th verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.000]   And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.680]   Let's take it with the 14th verse.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.400]   And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.600]   of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:52.200]   And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for or upon grace.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.480]   We come back once more to a study of this great statement, than which there is nothing
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.320]   greater in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.160]   Here is the essence and the fullness of the Christian salvation, what it means.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.920]   This is the Christian testimony.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.760]   This is the summary of all that John rarely goes on to say in the remainder of his Gospel.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.800]   Now the great question therefore is how we find ourselves as we read such a statement
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.480]   as this.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   Of his fullness have all we received, and grace upon grace.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   Is it true of us?
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.360]   Were the words we have just been singing true of us?
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.640]   But what to those who find are this?
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.320]   Nor tongue nor pen can show the love of Jesus what it is, none but his loved ones know.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:07.360]   O Jesus, light of all below, thou fount of life and fire, surpassing all the joys we
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.560]   know and all we can desire.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now that is Christianity.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.600]   Those words were written in the twelfth century.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.880]   They were true then, they were true before then.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.640]   Thank God they have been true since then.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.480]   And they are to be the truth about the Christian now and in every subsequent age, until he
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   shall come again and wind up the affairs of earth and send the kingdom back to his father.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.000]   We are here then, I say, confronted with what we should be as Christians and what our testimony
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   should be as Christians.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   We began looking at this last Sunday morning.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.160]   And we noticed that there are two things which are of necessity true.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.080]   And that is that if we are not able to say this, if we are not able to use the words
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.280]   of the hymn we have just been singing, it is due to two main causes.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.000]   The first is some failure somewhere or another to realize the truth about him.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.320]   And secondly, our failure to realize what is available to us or possible to us in him
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.520]   and through him and from him.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.320]   Now it is as simple as that.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.120]   If any one of us therefore feels at this moment, "Well, I can't say that.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.200]   I can't utter the words of your text.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   I wish I could.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.960]   And though I sang those words of that hymn, they're not really true to my experience.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.720]   I don't know him in such a manner that nor tongue nor pen can adequately describe it."
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.520]   Now I say there are only two explanations of that.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.560]   Somewhere or another your knowledge of him is defective.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.080]   Somewhere or another you have not received of his fullness, perhaps through not realizing
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.440]   what is possible.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.120]   Now this is the whole problem of the Christian life.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.840]   It was the problem in the early centuries at the very beginning.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   That is why, as I've been pointing out, John never wrote this gospel.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.880]   But his whole object and purpose, as he says at the end of the 20th chapter, that we might
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.320]   know that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and that knowing this we might have life through
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   his name.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.920]   There is nothing more important for us therefore than to test ourselves by this great statement.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.880]   And we must give ourselves no rest nor peace until we can say that we have received, we
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.600]   know that we have received, of his fullness.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   John says we all have received.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.880]   He is not only thinking of himself and the other apostles, he is thinking of all the
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.240]   Christian people to whom his gospel was written and for whom it was intended.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.720]   This is, if you like, the charter of Christian people at all times and in all places.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.560]   Well now we are approaching this therefore, and it's obviously such a great and a comprehensive
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.520]   statement and such a vital one that we can afford to take nothing for granted.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.440]   I've therefore taken it in this way.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.800]   There are certain things therefore which are of necessity true about the Christian.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.760]   Here was the first we looked at, that the Christian is to be explained solely and entirely
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.560]   and exclusively in terms of his relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.160]   It may sound almost ridiculous to say that in the middle of the 20th century, and yet
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.880]   there's nothing more essential, there are people who talk about Christianity and doing
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.760]   Christian things and they never even mention him.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.680]   But this is basic.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.320]   It is of his fullness that we receive.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:16.600]   Therefore we are what we are, entirely, only, solely, exclusively as the result of our relationship
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.360]   to him.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.960]   We went on and laid down a second principle, and all these are absolutely vital to an understanding
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.960]   not only of this text but of the whole of the Christian gospel.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:38.120]   All God's dealings with men are in and through this blessed person, and through him alone.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.880]   He is the sole channel of God's grace.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.960]   All God's dealings in grace with mankind have always been in and through the Lord Jesus
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.280]   Christ.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   Even in the Old Testament, all the Old Testament saints were what they were because of what
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   they had received in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.720]   Abram rejoiced to see my day.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.080]   He saw it and was glad.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.040]   They all did.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.660]   And even though they didn't understand it fully, that was the thing that made them children
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.140]   of God.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:22.480]   God has no other way in which he deals with mankind except in and through his only begotten
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.360]   Son.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.280]   Or then we can put it like this, and we ended with this last Sunday morning.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.160]   He is the head of a new humanity.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.720]   The head of the first humanity was Adam, but he failed, and all his progeny failed with
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   him.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.280]   All that is true of all of us and of the whole world by nature this morning is the result
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.400]   of Adam's transgression.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.200]   We were in Adam, and when Adam fell, we all fell.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.320]   And we've all been reaping the consequences of that.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.880]   We've confirmed it, of course, willfully ourselves, but essentially what has caused all our troubles
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.440]   was the failure and the sin of the first Adam.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   Now the Christian way of salvation is this, that there is a second man, a last Adam.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.840]   He is this Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.740]   And salvation therefore consists of belonging to him, receiving of his fullness, being related
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.080]   to him, he being the head, and we the members of his body.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.680]   Here is the whole of the New Testament teaching.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:44.160]   So we must look at it in terms of him, our Lord Jesus Christ, as the head of this new
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.120]   humanity to which we belong.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.600]   And as I say, therefore, salvation becomes what we are told here, a receiving of his
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.720]   fullness, and grace upon grace.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:09.120]   Now then, our starting point therefore must be to start with him, and with his fullness.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.440]   So many, when they feel unhappy in their Christian life, or feel that they're lacking in something,
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.620]   they fall into the trap and into the error of starting with themselves.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   What do I need?
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.280]   What experience can I get?
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.320]   They look at themselves as entirely subjective, and now they go around seeking something that
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.060]   will give them this something that they want.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.280]   They start with themselves, they end with themselves.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.920]   At once, they become wide open to all the teaching of the cults and the false teachings
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.560]   and heresies, which are round and about us and never ready to come in at that point and
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.360]   say, "This is what you want, I'll give it to you," and they fall victim to it.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.680]   Satisfied for a while, but only for a while, because it's not true, it's not the truth.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.560]   And again, they find themselves in difficulties.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.960]   No, that's not the right way to do it.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:10.120]   If the whole secret of the Christian life is to receive of his fullness, well then obviously
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.000]   the first thing to do is to consider him, and his fullness.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.360]   You see, and that is precisely what John does in this gospel.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.240]   We've seen at great length how in the first 18 verses of this gospel, John in this so-called
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.080]   prologue starts with him.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   You see, this is the Christian method, this is the Christian way of giving us all we stand
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.080]   in need of.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.120]   It comes to us and says not something about us, it doesn't start with us and our problems,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.000]   it says, "In the beginning was the Word."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.760]   Takes you right back there.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.600]   It starts with him, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.840]   There's no hope for us unless we are absolutely clear about him and about his fullness.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:07.360]   So let us go on then with this consideration and analysis of what we are told about this.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:15.640]   Now, he has of course, according to this teaching, his own essential fullness.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   He is the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.400]   The same was in the beginning with God.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.560]   That is the fullness of the guardian.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.320]   He is co-equal, co-eternal with the Father.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.080]   He is God the Son.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.640]   He is God the eternal expression of the Father, the Word.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.880]   He is light, he is life.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.520]   All things were made by him, without him was not anything made that was made.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:01.560]   Now all these are expressions which point us to his inherent and essential fullness.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:09.120]   God is fullness, God is glory, God is light, God is life.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.160]   God is essential fullness, there is no lack, there is no need, there is no deficiency.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:27.520]   God is, and this blessed person is the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.040]   You see my friends, you can never have the fullness of the Christian life unless you
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.340]   know something about Christian doctrine.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:42.800]   And you start with this great and glorious doctrine of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.000]   You don't understand it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Who can understand such things?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.520]   But this is what is revealed to us.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   This is the way of salvation.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:59.760]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons, and yet one God, sharing this eternal fullness,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.400]   the fullness in each one, and yet the three in one.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   Now then, there is what I call his essential fullness.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.880]   We don't start with Jesus of Nazareth, we don't start with the babe of Bethlehem, we
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.200]   start in the beginning, we start in the eternity, we start in the glory everlasting.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.480]   And it's because the modern world doesn't do that that it is as it is.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.600]   You see, the modern world makes this world the center of the universe.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   It doesn't.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.520]   There's the center.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:41.280]   And everything here must be considered and seen in its relationship to that center.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.360]   So you start always, whatever you may feel, whatever deficiency, whatever lack, whatever
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.920]   trouble you may be in, you don't merely start there.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.240]   Get away from yourself.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:05.280]   You look at him and contemplate him in his own essential, inherent, everlasting fullness.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.480]   But now we don't stay there, we don't stop there.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.560]   We must do what John does here in this very prologue.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:23.720]   He moves from the essential, inherent fullness to what we may describe as his fullness as
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.760]   our representative.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.080]   Because this is where it all becomes related to us.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.040]   Of his fullness have we received.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.360]   John, you see, brings us in at this point, as he's brought us in in verses 12 and 13.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.560]   believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.480]   the will of men, but of God.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.800]   In other words, we don't meet, though I say that you start with this great doctrine,
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.000]   with theology, you don't stop there.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.160]   You're not merely intellectuals contemplating some objective truth.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.560]   No, no, we are interested in that because of our relationship to it.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:16.080]   So immediately now, we move from the inherent essential fullness to his fullness as our
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:25.560]   representative, as the redeemer, as the savior, as the mediator.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.240]   Now let me put it like this.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:38.040]   God the Son in all his inherent and essential and eternal fullness could not deliver us
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.200]   and save us if he had remained that.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.880]   Now that's a tremendous thing to say, but it's true.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.560]   The whole message of the Bible can be put like this, that the almighty and everlasting
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:06.040]   God could not save fallen men by a word, by a teaching, by an edict.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.360]   It could not be done.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   I say it could not be done because if it could have been done, it would have been done.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   And you would never have had your New Testament, you'd never have had your Gospels, you'd
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   never have had the New Testament teaching.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   If the Son had remained there in that eternal glory, we should all be lost.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.920]   Not a soul would ever have been saved.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:42.240]   The notion, in other words, that we are saved because of God's love in and of itself is
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.360]   a denial of the whole of the Gospel, nothing less.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.160]   That's the popular idea today, isn't it?
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   That God is love.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.520]   Therefore, if you sin, you go and tell God you're sorry, God says it's all right, I
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.840]   forgive you, the love of God forgives us.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.040]   Well, if that were so, you'd have no need of a New Testament.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.960]   You'd have no need of an Old Testament.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.720]   Because the whole of the Old Testament points to one who is going to come, who is going
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.480]   to be the deliverer, the Savior, the mediator.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.240]   And the New Testament tells us that he has come.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   But it wouldn't have been necessary.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.640]   If the love of God alone is enough, and God simply tells us that he forgives us because
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.720]   we repent and are sorry, then the whole of the Bible can be thrown overboard.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.160]   It's not necessary.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:37.520]   But that is a complete denial of the entire teaching of the whole Biblical revelation.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.280]   You see, these steps are perfectly clear.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.880]   God's grace only comes to us, and can only come to us, through this person.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.840]   But it cannot come even through this person if he remained in the everlasting and the
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.200]   eternal glory.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.840]   Because God the Son alone, he could not save us.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.900]   Now there are many reasons for this, into which we needn't enter this morning.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.760]   But one, and a very obvious one, is this.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.400]   That it was man who failed.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.600]   And it is man alone who therefore can redeem.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.560]   The Apostle Paul puts that in striking manner in the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.400]   to the Corinthians, when he puts it like this, "For since by man came death, by man came
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.440]   also the resurrection of the dead."
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.480]   God has absolute rules and laws.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.920]   He made a man, he made him the representative.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   He failed, as I say.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.040]   Well now then, it is a man alone that can bring redemption.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   So the eternal Son of God, in the glory everlasting, if he had remained there, could never have
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.520]   been the mediator, the saviour, and the redeemer.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:02.080]   In other words, the incarnation of the Son of God was an absolute necessity to the salvation
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   of man.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.400]   And that of course is exactly what John tells us.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.760]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:18.120]   That's the whole point of the Prologue, it's the whole point of his entire Gospel.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.000]   This is the thing which saves us.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It is because of this alone that we are able to receive of his fullness.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.600]   If he'd remained there, we couldn't have received of it.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.640]   We'd be incapable of receiving of it.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.280]   We are men, he is God, absolute in all his fullness.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.000]   And man cannot be joined to God in that manner directly.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.440]   He cannot receive of that fullness.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:47.400]   The incarnation was an absolute necessity.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.360]   He must become man before he can save us.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.280]   He must be made flesh.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.160]   Now this is of course the great beginning of the Gospel, the good news of salvation.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.640]   The Apostle Paul again sums it up in those wonderful words in 2 Corinthians 8, 9.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:14.040]   You know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, how though he was rich, for our sakes
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:20.760]   he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.360]   Of his fullness of all we received and grace upon grace, how?
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.120]   That's exactly how it happened.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   He made himself poor.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.440]   That's the whole meaning of the incarnation, that he's coming down in order that we, through
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.240]   him, might be made rich.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.040]   Now then this is the thing therefore that we've got to work out together.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.680]   John puts it here in his own characteristic manner in this prologue.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.160]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.120]   Yes, but let's keep our eye on this particular point.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   How we see his fullness now as our representative, because that is what it all means, that is
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.320]   what it all is.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.080]   It's his fullness as our representative that we are concerned about.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.320]   And so we look at it in this way and manner.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.440]   We look at the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.560]   We look, if you like, at the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.240]   And we look at the boy in the temple.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.120]   We look at the young men doing the work of a carpenter.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.220]   We look at that young preacher at the age of 30.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.920]   We watch him, we look at him, we are contemplating him.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   Who is this?
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.120]   That's the question.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.200]   And what we must say is this, and it's essential to our salvation.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.320]   He is still perfect God.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   Veiled in flesh, the Godhead seen, hail incarnate deity.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.800]   Now there is the Christian affirmation.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.280]   Now it's very important we should be clear about this.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:13.040]   You remember how the Apostle Paul again puts this in the great passage in the second chapter
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.440]   of the epistle to the Philippians, which is crucial in this whole connection.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:26.360]   Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:33.320]   thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.760]   upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and being found in
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.920]   fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   cross.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.960]   Now that's a vital passage, but it's very vital that we should interpret it correctly.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.440]   There was a great controversy about this, the end of the last century and the beginning
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   of the present one.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.560]   Because a school arose in the church which taught that it said this, that what is translated
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:15.360]   here as he made himself of no reputation, should rarely be translated he emptied himself.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:23.320]   And they said that means he emptied himself of his Godhead, kenosis, the kenotic theory.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.640]   They said Jesus of Nazareth was only a man, he had emptied himself of his Godhead, he
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.160]   was no longer God, he was only man.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.360]   Now this is obviously a crucial point, that isn't what the apostle says.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   The apostle says that he was in the form of God, he always had been.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.640]   That's the word in the beginning, that was with God, and that was God.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.180]   He was in the form of God, that was his appearance as it were.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.680]   He was the eternal second person in the blessed holy trinity.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.220]   But he said he thought it not robbery to be equal with God, which really means this and
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.480]   should be translated like this.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:13.100]   He didn't regard that as a prize to be held on to, to be clutched at, at all costs.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   What then did he do?
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.440]   Well, as we read here, he made himself of no reputation, which is really the correct
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   translation.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.100]   It doesn't mean that he emptied himself of his Godhead, because it cannot mean that
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.680]   for this reason.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.760]   God cannot empty himself of Godhead, there's nothing left if he did, but he couldn't in
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   any case.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   God cannot.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.420]   God is, and God is everlastingly, and God cannot do this to himself.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.740]   It is inconceivable.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.180]   It is inconceivable of the Father or of the Son or of the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.600]   No, what happened was this.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:57.680]   He made himself of no reputation, which means this, that though he still is that everlasting
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:06.180]   and eternal Son of God in all the fullness of the Godhead, he made himself of no reputation.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.900]   He took upon him the form.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.660]   He, remember, remaining the same, now took on another form.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.960]   He hasn't changed his nature, but he has changed the form of his appearance.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.980]   He took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and being
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.140]   found in fashion as a man.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.900]   He, remember, remains the same still.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.940]   So the great statement is this.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.100]   That though he is the everlasting and eternal Son of God, and shares all this glory and
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.180]   this fullness everlastingly with the Father, and had existed always in that indescribable
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:49.700]   glory which is God, and which means that no man can see God at any time because of the
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   glory.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.060]   No man can see God and live.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.700]   Very well, this is what happened.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:26:02.580]   Our Lord, for your sake and mine, that's the argument, for your sake and mine, in order
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:09.940]   that we might be saved, didn't say, "I must go on holding on to this appearance,
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.540]   to this manifestation, to the signs and the evidence of the glory.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.460]   I'm not going to hold on to that at all costs."
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.500]   No, I will lay that appearance on one side.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.420]   I will make myself of no reputation.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.020]   And so he became the Babe of Bethlehem.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.860]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.120]   You look into that manger and the people thought it was just an ordinary child.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.620]   They looked and saw, "But a man!"
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.860]   "No, no," says Charles Wesley, "that's what's so terribly wrong."
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:50.740]   Veiled in flesh, he's veiled in flesh, the appearance, the form, the likeness, the fashion.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.740]   You see, veiled in flesh.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.980]   That's the form now, that's the fashion now, that is the appearance now.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:05.180]   But it's the Godhead that's there, veiled in the flesh, the God, the second person in
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.580]   the blessed holy Trinity.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.380]   The form has changed.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.140]   He's made himself of no reputation, has become a helpless babe, but he is still the same
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.140]   one.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.260]   He hasn't ceased to be God.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.140]   He hasn't emptied himself of his Godhead.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.580]   No, no, he still is.
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.820]   That's why he said, as we'll read later on in the eighth chapter of this gospel, according
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:32.220]   to John, he said, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.260]   Of course, he's still the same person.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.060]   The God is there in all his fullness still.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.020]   He hasn't ceased to be God.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:48.420]   All the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.260]   Now you see the importance of this.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.220]   It is essential to our salvation.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.860]   If you want to receive of his fullness, well you must know the truth about him, and you
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.100]   must know something of the nature and the character of his fullness.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.100]   Very well.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.100]   There he had it in eternity.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.860]   Yes, but you and I can't receive of it if he remains there.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.700]   So he makes himself of no reputation, and he comes in this other form, in this other
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:15.860]   appearance, in this other fashion, in order that we might receive of this fullness and
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.140]   grace for grace.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.420]   But that's only one side of it, isn't it?
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.060]   He is perfect God still.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.660]   He remained perfect God as he walked through this world and did everything he did.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.980]   He was perfect God as he was dying upon the cross, as they took down the dead body and
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.160]   buried it in the grave.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:45.780]   He was still perfect God, in no sense diminished.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:51.580]   But he is also perfect man.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.900]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:02.940]   He was made in the likeness of men.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.500]   The apostle puts it differently in writing to the Romans in chapter 8 and verse 3.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.260]   He says there that he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.740]   The word was made flesh, yes, he wasn't made in sinful flesh, but he was made in the likeness
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.980]   of sinful flesh.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.380]   Again a most important point.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.500]   The whole teaching of the New Testament is that he was born of a virgin, and that he
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   was born perfect.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.500]   Why?
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.860]   Well, you see, we've already seen the explanation of this.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:41.740]   The first man was made in the image and the likeness of God, and he was perfect.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.500]   Adam in his original creation was without sin.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   He was innocent.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.780]   There was no blemish, there was no fault in him whatsoever.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:55.040]   He was a perfect man, but he fell.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:02.100]   And you and I cannot be saved unless there is a perfect man who doesn't fall, and who
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.700]   not only doesn't fall himself but can lift us up and save us.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.460]   So he must be perfect.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.620]   Therefore he cannot have been born in sinful flesh.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.620]   That's one of the modern heresies.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.220]   There are people who are saying that.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.020]   They were saying that being born of Mary, who was sinful like everybody else, and one
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:26.420]   of the children of Adam, that our Lord's human nature must have been sinful, must have
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.420]   been fallen.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.380]   That is to deny the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.300]   It is to make it impossible that he should be our Saviour.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.500]   If he has any sin in him, well then he has to do something about his own sin.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.540]   It is the perfect Saviour alone who can save us.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.660]   So he comes in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:51.420]   Now the Scriptures have many interesting ways of putting this great statement.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:59.820]   Let me put it to you like this, as it is put by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.740]   He is contrasting the law as a way of salvation with the Christian gospel.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.540]   He says it is not possible, verse 4, chapter 10 of Hebrews, "It is not possible that the
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.620]   blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:18.660]   Therefore when he cometh into the world, he saith," and he is quoting Psalm 40, "Sacrifice
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.860]   and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.500]   In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:34.700]   Then said I, Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will,
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   O God.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.940]   A body hast thou prepared me, and if he hadn't come in the body, none of us would be saved,
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.900]   and none of us could receive of his fullness.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.100]   So he hath to come in the body.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.060]   The incarnation is an absolute essential, or take it in the wonderful way in which we
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.060]   saw it in the reading at the beginning in the second chapter of that epistle to the
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060]   Hebrews.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.460]   You see, here is the difficulty.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.380]   Here is the thing that people don't understand.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.940]   That we are told that God made men perfect.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.580]   One in a certain place testified saying, "What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.740]   son of men that thou visitest him?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.700]   Thou madest him a little lower than the angels, but thou crowned him with glory and honor,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.140]   and it set him over the works of thy hands.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:26.180]   Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet."
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.980]   That is what the Bible tells us about man, about ourselves.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.620]   In that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.900]   But here is our problem.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.780]   We see, we know, we see not yet all things put under him.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:45.100]   It is very obvious in this modern world that everything is not under man.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.940]   Man indeed is under these things, these powers, these atoms, atomic power and so on.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.940]   Man is a victim.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.220]   Pestilence, his accidents, all these things.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.260]   Man isn't over all.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.220]   We don't see him yet over all things.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.900]   But wait a minute, says this man.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.980]   It is quite right, you are perfectly right.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.540]   We don't see everything yet put under men, but we see Jesus.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.300]   Here is the hope, here is the fullness.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:15.380]   We see Jesus, who himself was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.380]   That is where we were.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.300]   We were made a little lower than the angels, so he was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   What for?
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.300]   For the suffering of death.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.820]   "Crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should test death for every
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.820]   man."
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.820]   Then he goes on to expand it.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.140]   He says it became him.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.420]   It was appropriate to his method of action.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.300]   It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   This is God.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:48.180]   "In bringing many sons unto glory," that's you and myself, "it behove him therefore to
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:55.700]   make the captain, the leader of their salvation, perfect through suffering.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.060]   For both he that sanctifieth," that's the Lord Jesus Christ, "and they who are sanctified
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.820]   are all of one nature," of like nature.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:12.940]   "Wherefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.020]   unto my brethren.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.900]   In the midst of the church will I sing praise, and again I will put my trust in him, and
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.540]   again behold I and the children which God hath given me."
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:29.540]   Now then, "forasmuch then," here's the argument, "and you see my friend, the way to receive
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.460]   of his fullness, the way to have happiness and joy and peace and power in the Christian
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.900]   life is to follow the logic and the argument of the scripture, to follow out the working
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.460]   of this mighty doctrine.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.460]   Forasmuch then."
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.900]   Are you with me?
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.460]   Are you following, says the author?
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.940]   Are you able to reason it through?
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:54.020]   "Forasmuch then as the children," that's you and I, "are partakers of flesh and blood,
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.900]   he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.860]   him that hath the power of death," that is to say the devil, "and deliver them who through
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.060]   fear of death were all their lifetime subject abundant."
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.300]   Then, in order that you don't make any mistake about this, he puts it negatively.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.660]   "For verily he took not on him the nature of angels."
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:21.060]   He didn't come into this world to stretch out a helping hand to angels, no, "but he
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:26.100]   took on him the seed of Abraham," man, not angels.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:34.660]   "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:42.860]   be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.540]   for the sins of his people.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:52.420]   For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able also to succor them that
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.420]   are tempted."
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.820]   Now then, here is the point that has been established.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.060]   We see Jesus, but who is he?
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.700]   Well, he is perfect God.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.100]   He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, yes, yes, but
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.300]   he doesn't change, he's still God.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.420]   He hasn't changed his nature, he simply made himself of no reputation.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.140]   He has humbled himself, he's come in this form, in this fashion, for the time being,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.660]   for a specific end and purpose.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.620]   He is what he's always been.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.260]   He's already told us that at the beginning.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.460]   "God, who at sundry times and in divers mennas spake in time past unto the fathers by the
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:33.580]   prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.780]   of all things, by whom also he made the worlds."
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:44.900]   Listen, "who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.380]   all things by the word of his power.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:54.780]   When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high."
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:02.740]   He is still this perfect, absolute God, undiminished in all his eternal fullness of glory, but
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.220]   at the same time, he is perfect man.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.100]   He is truly man.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:14.060]   He was given a human soul, "a body hast thou prepared me."
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.620]   He had a soul, he had the faculties and the propensities made in all points like as we
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.700]   are, and tempted in all points like as we are.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.660]   His manhood was also full and complete and perfect.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:37.540]   He is a perfect man as Adam was a perfect man, but these two natures are joined together
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.740]   in the one person.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.620]   He is God, he is man.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:50.860]   He is fully God, he is fully man.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:56.620]   These are the two absolutes, and the two are in the one person.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.900]   He wasn't two persons, he was only one person.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:08.140]   But in this one person, there were these two natures.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:14.900]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:21.140]   We beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:28.860]   truth, and yet we beheld him dying upon the cross.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:34.500]   God, man, two natures in one person.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.140]   No admixture of the natures, the two natures remain separate.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.220]   They can communicate with one another, but they are there in all their fullness in the
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.340]   one person.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:52.260]   Does somebody want to say at this point, I can't follow that, I can't understand that?
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:58.180]   My dear friend who does understand it, I don't understand it.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.620]   I'm here to proclaim it.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.220]   This is the message of the gospel.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:07.860]   What I know is this, that a perfect man could not save me.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.220]   The perfect man fell in Adam.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.500]   There was no deficiency in Adam, there was no lack.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.620]   So God doesn't make another perfect man and that only.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   That would not save us.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.740]   He would fall as the first man fell.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   No, no, something more is necessary.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.340]   And this is what is necessary and this is what happened.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.940]   That the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity, this absolute eternal God in all
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.500]   his fullness, the Word, became man also.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.620]   He took unto him human nature.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:46.740]   He joined unto himself this seed of the new humanity.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.820]   And he did it in order to start this new humanity.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.660]   He did it in order to be our representative.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.780]   Because we can't be saved unless we have someone to represent us.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:04.380]   We know our problem, the guilt of our sin, the fallen evil nature, the necessity of being
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.700]   like God before we can ever stand in his presence and spend eternity with him.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.060]   So it is necessary that we have a perfect man and a perfect God.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.940]   And here he is in Jesus Christ.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.140]   We see the two in one.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:23.420]   I say don't try to understand it.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:32.940]   You just look at this with the Apostle Paul and you say, "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.980]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.980]   That's it.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.580]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.820]   Or as John puts it here, "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.540]   He can't because no man can see me and live as God told Moses of old.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.540]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:41:00.660]   But the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, still he hath declared
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.660]   him.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.660]   He's drawn him out.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.780]   He's manifested him.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.780]   He has made him manifest.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.740]   I can't see God but I can see Jesus and in him I see God.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   Didn't he say it?
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.540]   "He hath seen me, hath seen the Father."
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:23.340]   Now here I say is the glory and the wonder and the mystery of the Christian way of salvation.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:30.180]   Don't try to understand it, my dear friend, but marvel in it that in order that you might
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:35.300]   receive something of this fullness, in order that you and I might be partakers of the divine
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:41.780]   nature, in order that we might be redeemed and rescued and have the hope of an eternal
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:52.780]   bliss in the everlasting glory, he came down and took upon him human nature.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.460]   But remember it was perfect.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.580]   That is why we must believe in the virgin birth.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:05.820]   That is why we say he was not produced by natural generation.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:12.680]   That is why we say that even that portion of the human nature of Mary out of which his
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:18.700]   body came was dealt with by the Holy Ghost and purified and cleansed and was rendered
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.060]   perfect.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.780]   You see that was the way in which the announcement was made to Mary.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.100]   So many people forget this.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.260]   Mary couldn't understand this, you remember.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.300]   When she saw him, the archangel made his announcement about the birth of this son, she was troubled
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.580]   at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:47.660]   The angel answered and said, "Fear not, Mary, thou hast found favour with God and men."
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.260]   And she's going to conceive.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.940]   Mary still doesn't understand when she's told about this wonderful person.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.020]   Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?"
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:07.540]   The angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.780]   of the highest shall overshadow thee."
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.140]   Now there's another great mystery.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.660]   But what it means is this.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:20.500]   He was conceived of the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost cleansed this bit of form humanity
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:27.180]   until it was entirely free from sin, and here is the body of the new humanity, the Holy
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.180]   Ghost.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:34.180]   Virgin birth, no human father.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.660]   He's come to start a new humanity.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.740]   The Word was made flesh, it had to be.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.260]   He couldn't do all the things that he did for us unless this had happened, as I say.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.100]   This is an absolute necessity.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:50.740]   This is the first step in the bringing of that fullness unto us.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   And it involves and implies that.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:01.140]   So we leave it this morning in these words again used by the great apostle in that mighty
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:06.340]   statement of this selfsame doctrine, because the New Testament's full of all this.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:13.060]   Paul says it twice over in Colossians 119, "It pleased the Father that in him should
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.380]   all fullness dwell."
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.740]   In that body, you see, in that human body, in that person who appeared to be a man only,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.100]   there is all the fullness of the Godhead.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:32.060]   But he says it again in chapter 2 in verse 9, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:37.900]   of the Godhead bodily."
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:43.820]   And my dear friend, that statement ought to put us all onto our feet, singing and praising
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.860]   and thanking God.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:56.180]   Though he was so rich, for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.180]   made rich.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.500]   Yes, he came to the poverty of a stable, and the straw, and the cattle, and the manger,
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:10.060]   and they couldn't afford to sacrifice lambs, only two turtle doves, abject poverty.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.620]   But he still, the eternal God, veiled in flesh the Godhead see.
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.580]   Hail, incarnate deity.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:27.660]   You and I receive of his fullness, because the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:32.820]   because he didn't hold on to this equality with God in external manifestation as something
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.260]   never to be let go of.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.260]   He let go of it.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.100]   The signs and the appearance, he changed his fashion.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.180]   He came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.700]   He came in the form of a servant.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.100]   That's the beginning of it.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.700]   Have you received of his fullness?
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.780]   Are you doubtful?
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.020]   Are you uncertain?
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.300]   Well, stop thinking about yourself.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.700]   Go straight back to him.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:07.540]   Go back to the gospel with this tremendous beginning, this great doctrine of the incarnation
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.220]   and the virgin birth.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   Dwell upon it.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   Ask questions.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.220]   Say, why did he do that?
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.700]   Why did that have to happen?
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:19.180]   And you're on the higher road to discovering the way in which you can receive of his fullness
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.700]   and grace upon grace.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   May God enable us all to do so.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.700]   Amen.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.700]   Amen.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.700]   Amen.
