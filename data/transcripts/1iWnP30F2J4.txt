[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.800]   We are back after a week-long break from the podcast
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.280]   and we have a full week ahead, Pastor John,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.800]   so let's dive into the mountain of emails
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   that never stop flowing in.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.720]   Austin, a listener in Atlanta writes in,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.260]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.480]   "When asked about the significance of the cross,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.160]   "most Christians can give the Sunday school answer
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.920]   "that Jesus died to save us from our sin.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.360]   "While this is a beautiful, true, and profound truth,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.140]   "it can sometimes appear simple and one-dimensional.
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.400]   "How would you encourage me
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.440]   "to have an enlarged view of the cross?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.240]   "How can I approach God's Word and life in a way
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   "that continually broadens my understanding and love
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.260]   "for that pivotal moment in history?"
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.480]   - Well, I love this question and I love it
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.120]   because right off my front burner,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.600]   the answer to the question
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.320]   happened to me in worship yesterday,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.560]   but let me say something else before I say that.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.040]   Austin is clearly right.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640]   He's got his handle on the right way to live.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.640]   He wants to go deeper and wider in the cross of Christ
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.120]   than he has ever gone before,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.240]   and he wants that to be continually happening.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.800]   So let me give three different kinds of answer
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.880]   to the question, how can we approach God's Word?
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.640]   How can we approach life so that this deepening,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.480]   widening, heightening of our experience of,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.320]   understanding of, love for the cross happens?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.440]   Number one, linger over and meditate regularly
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.200]   on Galatians 6.14 or other texts like it.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.880]   Goes like this, "Far be it from me to boast,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   "except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.640]   Now that is an astonishing statement.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.240]   Um,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   everything in the world has died to us,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   and we have died to it, it says at the end of the verse.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   But this statement, "Far be it from us to boast,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   "or glory, or rejoice, except in the cross,"
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.640]   is really wildly exaggerated, it seems,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.640]   because the Bible talks about exalting and rejoicing in
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   and boasting in other things,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.600]   like exalt in the hope of the glory of God, Romans 5.2,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.440]   exalt in your tribulations, Romans 5.3,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.320]   exalt and boast in your weaknesses, 2 Corinthians 12.9,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.240]   exalt in other believers, 1 Thessalonians 2.19.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.760]   So what does he mean when he says,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.920]   "Always boast in the cross."
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   God forbid that I should boast except in the cross,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   which I take it means we should always boast in the cross.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.800]   If there's any boasting, it should be in the cross.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.080]   So what in the world, what in the world does that mean?
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I think it means this,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.480]   all other boasting, which is right,
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.720]   he's got other boastings that he commends
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.920]   in the New Testament,
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   all other boasting should also be a boasting in the cross.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   All exaltation in anything
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.360]   should be an exaltation in the cross.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.760]   If you exalt in the hope of glory,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.080]   you should be exalting in the cross of Christ.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.880]   If you exalt in tribulation,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   you should be exalting in the cross of Christ.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.920]   If you exalt in your weaknesses or in the people of God,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.480]   in that very exalting,
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.960]   you should be exalting in the cross of Christ.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.160]   Well, what in the world does that mean?
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.800]   How do you do that?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.080]   In other words, I'm saying,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.960]   if you boast in anything at all,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   it should be a boasting in the cross also.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.280]   Why, how, what in the world?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.440]   It's true, this is true because, think of it this way,
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   Christians, all Christians are sinners
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.800]   and do not deserve anything but judgment,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   which means that daily, hour by hour,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.040]   we are receiving hundreds of good things
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.880]   that we don't deserve and bad things that happen to us,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   which are being turned for good.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.440]   Why?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.080]   Why do people who don't deserve anything good
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   and they don't deserve to have the bad things
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   turned for good, get so many good things
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.360]   and get all their bad things turned for good, why?
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.760]   And the answer is Christ died for us.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.680]   The new covenant purchases the favor of God
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   and poured out in all those acts of grace.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.800]   Elect sinners only receive good things
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   because they are bought by the blood of Jesus,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.040]   which means that there isn't anything that happens to us.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   And I'm saying this so that Austin will feel amazed
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.400]   at the cross because the cross is never farther away
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.360]   than the happy things you're experiencing
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   or the hard things you're experiencing
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.160]   getting turned for good.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.920]   So that's my first response to Austin.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   The glory of the cross is ever present underneath
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   as the foundation for every good you ever experience.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.960]   Number two, second way of coming at this,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.240]   and this is what I was talking about
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   when I said that yesterday in worship this happened.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.960]   I was singing and reading the texts
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.560]   that were being put up on the overhead,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.120]   I mean on the screen for us,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.800]   and a fresh, deep, sweet, moving,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.580]   unusual for a long time, taste of the love of Christ
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.580]   in the cross came over me and I was so moved and thankful.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.120]   And the reason that happened was largely
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.920]   because of the words of the hymns.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   So I'm gonna say to Austin,
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   make it your habit to sing great old hymns
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.140]   and good modern worship songs that are cross-centered
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.600]   and Bible-saturated with the gospel of Christ.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.920]   And the one we sang yesterday was,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.820]   Let the water and the blood from thy wounded side
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.020]   which flowed be of sin.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.340]   And then this phrase, the double cure,
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.740]   save from wrath and make me pure.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.400]   That's really good, really good.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.500]   It's freshly good.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.660]   Two cures happened in the cross,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.740]   wrath removed and me made pure.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.300]   What a great gift in singing.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.680]   And then not the labors of my hands
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.860]   can fulfill the laws commands.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.140]   Could my zeal, no, respite, no.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.500]   In other words, if I could be as zealous
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.740]   as the apostle Paul 24/7, 80 years long,
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.740]   with tears flowing, not one bit of it could atone.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.060]   Thou must save and thou alone.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.580]   Oh, that's so powerful.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.060]   Nothing in my hand I bring simply to the cross.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.420]   I cling naked, come to thee for dress.
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.220]   Helpless, look to thee for grace.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.820]   Foul, I to the fountain fly.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.500]   Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.300]   There's something about the plea of that verse.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.700]   Savior, Savior, wash me.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.620]   I'm foul, dress me, I'm naked.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.980]   I could just feel how shameful that would be
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.740]   and how dirty I am.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.620]   And so the hymn with the tune gives a fresh taste
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.400]   and experience of the love of Christ at the cross.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.780]   While I draw this feeding,
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.740]   and this one may perhaps move me most of all
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.700]   because I'm 70 years old.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.180]   While I draw this fleeting breath,
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.020]   when my eyes shall close in death,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.660]   when I soar to worlds unknown,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.100]   see thee on thy judgment throne,
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.540]   rock of ages cleft for me.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   Let me hide myself in thee.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.020]   I know that at the last fleeting breath,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.940]   I'm not gonna plead my good deeds.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.180]   You know, like I worked hard for desiring God.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.660]   I spoke in a lot of places, blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.340]   No, what a paltry, I mean, wood, hay, and stubble
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.420]   is just not going to be sufficient
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.060]   to make me acceptable at the judgment.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.100]   One thing will, the rock of ages was cleft on the cross
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.940]   and I'm gonna hide.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.100]   So all that just to say to Austin,
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.180]   get a good hymn book, go online,
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.100]   find some hymns and sing them.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.180]   And find a good church where they put together
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.060]   beautiful Christ exalting gospel saturated songs
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.380]   that heal you every Sunday.
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.300]   And I got one more thing to say.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.540]   The third thing that I would mention
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.220]   is to meditate on the dozens and dozens of passages
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.420]   in the New Testament that talk about
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.460]   varied purposes for the death of Jesus.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.940]   So I wrote a book about this.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.940]   Some years ago in relationship to Mel Gibson's movie,
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.340]   The Passion of the Christ,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.380]   I wrote a book, 50 Reasons Why Jesus Came to Die.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.900]   And that's the most concerted focus
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.220]   of anything I've ever written on the reasons for the cross
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.540]   to expand and deepen and intensify our love
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.780]   for what he accomplished.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.300]   And so if I could be of any help,
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.900]   that book is free for the download at desiringgod.org
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.080]   or you can get it at Amazon.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.060]   But whatever you do, Austin,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.980]   keep on asking God to open your eyes
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.900]   to the glories of the cross.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.900]   And then there's no substitute for setting your eyes,
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.100]   putting your eyes on the word
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.240]   where the cross is most central.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.020]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.420]   That would be a great summer read, by the way,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.020]   50 Reasons Why Jesus Came to Die.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.820]   It's one of the best John Piper books I've read.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.980]   And it's free online and you can download the PDF
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.660]   free of charge at our site at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.820]   Well, what is the joy of the Lord?
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.700]   The Bible talks about this phrase in a few places.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.980]   And of course, we wanna know what this joy is.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.300]   We wanna possess it and we wanna share it with one another.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.720]   So where can we find the joy of the Lord?
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.160]   John Piper will explain tomorrow when we return.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.000]   I'll see you then.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.160]   (upbeat music)
