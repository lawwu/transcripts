[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380]   I want to shift us to rocking. I really dislike rocking, but now you got me rocking. So tell us
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.880]   why rocking and things like it are so valuable and are distinctly different than like, quote,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.500]   unquote, hitting the gym. So I'll tell you how I sort of came to this realization, started writing
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.300]   about this in the first place, is that when we were in the Arctic, we're hunting, right? So when
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.420]   you look at why humans are good at running, and by the way, we're good at two things. We're good at
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800]   running and we're good at caring. And I'll tell you why we're good at caring. So the reason we're good
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.160]   at running is because we evolved to run long distances to chase down animals in the heat
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.980]   and spear them. So humans are really good at cooling ourselves in the heat, right? And we can run these
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.040]   long distances. Other animals can't manage their heat. So we'd slowly but surely run down animals.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.180]   Eventually, they would get too hot, they'd topple over from heat exhaustion, and then bam,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.400]   we'd kill them. Okay, so this is a theory called, it's called persistence hunting.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.520]   So we won the thermoregulation game.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.620]   We run the, won the thermoregulation game. Yeah. So we can, we sweat, we don't have much fur,
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.600]   and then our bodies are also designed for this type of persistence hunting. There's a guy at
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.220]   Harvard, Dan Lieberman, who had this, I think it was in 2004, paper about this, how the reason we're built
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.020]   the way we are, one of the key reasons is so we could run long distances for persistence hunting.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.360]   So I'm familiar with that research, right? I'm like, oh, that's really interesting.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.460]   Cool. I'm like, yeah, this explains why I have like, you know, these big butt muscles, these arched feet,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.280]   whatever.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.220]   So we go up to the Arctic, we're hunting, eventually successfully hunt a caribou,
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.760]   and we, you know, we're taking every usable part of it we can, so we load our packs with all this
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.060]   weight, it's like a hundred something pounds in this damn pack, and start walking back to camp.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.840]   And I'm just thinking about this research about, okay, humans evolved to run long distances so we
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   could hunt. Great. But what happens after you actually kill an animal? You got to carry that
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.300]   damn thing back to camp, right? And so it occurs to me, well, wait a minute, we're also pretty unique
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.020]   among animals in that we can carry weight. Like no other mammal can just pick up weight on its own
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.040]   and carry it a long distance. It's like, huh, that's interesting. So I just start looking into this,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.600]   and yeah, humans are the only mammal that can pick up a weight and carry it a long distance,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.280]   and it absolutely shaped us into who we are. It allowed us to really conquer the globe, because we could
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.820]   take tools into the unknown, right? We can walk, we can cover these long distances in our two legs
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.520]   and our feet. Our hands are freed up to carry our tools, to carry whatever it might be, and it really
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.540]   turned us into who we are. Now, the thing is, is when you look at running, plenty of people run,
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.420]   right? Like running and marathons, that is a popular activity. But how many people are just like
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.580]   carrying weight as a regular form of exercise? The answer was really not that many. So I'm thinking
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.040]   like, okay, who actually still maybe does this? And it turns out it's the military. So rucking is sort of
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.680]   the main activity of physical training in the military, just throwing weight in a backpack and
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.040]   going for a long walk. And I've actually started to sort of even shift my language from using the term
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.540]   rucking to simply saying walking with weight or weighted walking. And the reason for that is, is if I tell
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.500]   my mom, hey, you should ruck, she goes, oh, okay. And she types in ruck and she goes, the hell is this
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.160]   military stuff, Michael? I'm 75 years old. So I've started to call it more walking with weight. So it's a little
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.120]   more approachable for the masses. But I think the benefit of it is that you're getting cardio stimulus
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.900]   because you're covering ground. But you're also getting strength work because you've loaded your
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.060]   skeletal system, your muscular system. And that comes with a lot of benefits. You kind of got this
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.740]   two in one. So it generally will burn more calories per mile than walking or running. And that is simply
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.040]   because you've added extra weight. Of course, if you're running, you might cover more distance in the
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.340]   same amount of time. But if you just compare it by distance, it's burning more calories. And I think it's
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.760]   one of these activities that can really fill in gaps in people's training. And to what you sort of
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.040]   alluded to in your question is there's a variety of reasons it fills in gaps. But one of them is
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.460]   simply that it gets people outside. Like there's a lot of gym people who are like, yeah, I lift all
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.380]   the weights, but like I'm not doing that running thing. A lot of people can't run and like, oh, by the
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.060]   way, walking feels a little too easy. I'm not going to do that. So if you can throw some load on someone
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.480]   and have them go for a walk, it gets them outside, helps them preferentially burn fat,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.020]   it seems compared to something like running. So there's this interesting study. And I'll caveat
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.680]   this by saying it was a very small study. I think it was only 12 people because they could only find 12
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.860]   crazy enough people to do it. It was on backcountry hunters in Alaska. And so these guys carry these
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.600]   heavy packs out into the mountains for a week or whatever. And they test them and they ended up losing
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.340]   a significant amount of weight, but it was all from fat. They actually gained like a very minute
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.860]   amount of muscle. And that really shouldn't happen in the context of going out and losing weight,
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.800]   right? You're probably going to lose fat along with muscle. But with this, they ended up losing
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.020]   mostly fat. So I just think it's this amazing activity that we really wove out of our lives due to
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.620]   technology. Humans evolved to carry. People were carrying babies all the time, like every day in
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.660]   the past. We'd go hunt and we'd have to carry all the meat back to camp. We would carry food that we
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.140]   gathered, like gathering. We're hunters and gatherers. Gathering is literally walking around,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.080]   finding some food, carrying it, finding more, carrying it back to camp. And then we got, you know,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.420]   cars. We got grocery carts. We got XYZ. We got furniture dollies that we don't carry as much.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:11.740]   And I think we've lost a really important form of human movement and physical activity that we're
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.100]   literally born to do. And so my suggestion to all the listeners is get some weight and carry it.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.740]   Easy to throw some weight in the backpack and go for a walk. And it'll be good for you.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.960]   How much weight and how far? So if someone is just starting, I tell them to start light. I think,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.780]   so after I published The Comfort Crisis with the, there's a chat, there's an entire chapter on
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.200]   walking with weight or rucking. I got all these people in the military, rucking destroyed me.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.860]   Okay, well, how much did the military start you with? A hundred pounds. It's like, well, yeah.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.200]   It's like, if you did anything at that intensity immediately, just immediately went into like
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.100]   the red, you're going to get injured. You know, it could be squatting. It's like, yeah, I tried to
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.400]   max out on my deadlift every time I deadlifted the first time I deadlifted. Therefore, no one should
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.780]   deadlift. You need to ease into this. So I tell people, women can start with anywhere from five to,
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.820]   say 20 pounds to just, um, men, anywhere from 10 to 30, depending on your fitness level.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.180]   I would rather have someone really ease in and sort of get used to it. Cause a lot of people will say,
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.560]   yeah, I went a little too heavy and it really sucked. Like I want you to sort of on ramp slowly.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.940]   And then from there you can build up over time. And so I have plenty of, you know, women who might
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:41.060]   weigh 130 pounds who now use 30 pounds, which is a significant amount of weight. Um, I'll have men
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.800]   who, you know, maybe they started with 20 and they're like, that's way too light. Like I, I just have too
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400]   much of a base of fitness. It's like, okay, good. Well, I'm glad we started there though. So we know for
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.320]   sure. And then they've ramped up to say 40, sometimes 60. I mean, for me, I generally,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.340]   my sort of go-to weight is probably 35 to 40 pounds. And I find that that's a weight where
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.480]   it's uncomfortable. It's challenging, but it's also not so soul crushing that I'm like,
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.200]   I got to end this walk. I guess this absolutely sucks. I can still enjoy it. And of course I'll go
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.440]   heavier. Sometimes if I'm going really far, sometimes I might be like 20 pounds or something.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.800]   You know, I think it's really just like start light, take a walk, see how that feels.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.900]   You know, it doesn't have to be too complicated. Yeah. I said, I hate rocking, but, um, I love the
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.140]   way I feel afterwards. Maybe that's the form of exercise. I don't like there. I just outed myself
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:40.420]   as not liking. I find that, um, it forces me to pay attention to some of the smaller stabilizing
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.900]   muscles. Like you can't be as loose with your gate. You have to be pretty thoughtful, especially if
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.880]   you're hiking. Um, you can't stride too long here or there. You, you just naturally keeps
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.980]   you moving more like a pack mule, uh, which I think can be helpful. Um, and I do notice
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:03.680]   that when I take off the rucksack or the vest, um, on a different day and I, and I run, I definitely
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   feel faster and lighter just by way of comparison, probably a real, real change too, due to the state
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.820]   small stabilizing muscles. This thing about losing more body fat, we'll get, we'll get
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.720]   people motivated. Yeah. People love, people love that. I think it's also a good tool for
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.620]   runners because the injury rate is much lower. So if you're within a reasonable amount of weight,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.280]   like of course, if you go up to these crazy weights, so I generally tell people, if you
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.660]   just want like a firm number, don't go over 50 pounds. Um, if you want a more sort of dialed
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.360]   in number to your body weight, don't go over a third of your body weight. There's a lot
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.280]   of military research that suggests that, but even for me, like I don't go up to a third of my body
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.940]   weight all that often, unless I have a really good reason I'm training for something like
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:49.300]   backpacking or hunt or something. Um, so if you're in a, within a reasonable amount of weight and not
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.760]   too heavy, um, the injury rate is exceedingly low. It's not that much higher than the injury rate of
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:03.380]   walking and walking is pretty safe. Do you ever experience the kind of, uh, crossover of understanding
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:10.060]   between, uh, your physical pursuits and your, um, creative intellectual pursuits? Like, do you find
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.000]   that for instance, if you, you rock that there's a certain, that you start to recognize where the
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.640]   resistance is, is it putting on the pack? Is it, uh, you know, a third of the way through you tend to
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.060]   feel pretty good. Do you notice those contours and do they map to the contour of sitting down and,
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.660]   and writing, um, that it's hard at first, then it gets easier. And then at some point there's a
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.040]   breakthrough or else it just plain sucks the whole time.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.840]   I think so. I'd like to hear your experience with running, but my experience with running is that
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   the first, say three miles, they suck. You know, this is hard. Like things just start, you just feel
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.080]   like resistance. And then eventually, usually after say mile three, all of a sudden I feel like,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.660]   oh, I could do this forever. I could do this the rest of the day if I wanted to.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.620]   But if I don't go through that first three miles, I'm never going to get to four plus or whatever it
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.140]   is. And I do feel like that's the same, um, with writing where it's, it's challenging at first,
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.820]   the things aren't moving, but then things just, things start to move, you know, and you, but you
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.040]   need to, you need that buy-in. Like you need the, you're not going to have those amazing four plus
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.000]   miles after mile four or sentence after the 20 paragraphs you deleted. If you don't run the first
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.060]   three miles or write the first 20 paragraphs.
