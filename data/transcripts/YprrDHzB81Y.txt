[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   [Music]
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.120]   We all come face to face with a dark fear in this world that cannot be brushed away.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   It's rarely spoken of, but it never goes unfelt, and it's the fear of death.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   This fear is universal in scope and it's enslaving in its power,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.240]   and is a fear Jesus Christ came to conquer and defeat on behalf of sinners like you and me.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.280]   John Piper explained this more fully in his sermon titled "You Will Never See Death"
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.520]   preached on May 14, 2011. Near the end of the sermon,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.200]   Pastor John explained Hebrews 2, verse 14 by saying this.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:50.160]   The effect of Jesus' death in our place as the God-man in Hebrews 2, verse 14
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.760]   is what I want you to feel and see in the last few minutes of this message.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.480]   "Since therefore the children," that's us, just people, "Since therefore the children
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.240]   share in flesh and blood," that is we're human, "He himself," the Son of God,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.320]   "likewise partook of the same things," the same nature, that is he became human.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.840]   See the dynamic. The question is now, since we're human, He became human.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.120]   He became human. This is what we're seeing in John all over the place.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:39.360]   And here's the reason. "So that through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death,"
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.640]   that is the devil, "and deliver," this is us now, "deliver all those who through the fear of death
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.320]   were subject to lifelong slavery." The writer to the Hebrews believes that all human beings
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:11.040]   are enslaved their whole life by the fear of death, even when they don't know it.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   In 1973, Ernest Becker wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book called "The Denial of Death."
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:36.640]   It was all the rage in the 70s. The thesis of the book was the same as the thesis of Hebrews.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:50.480]   Humanity is enslaved globally by fear of dying. And what humans do is deny,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   deny, deny, deny, and we find all kinds of ways, religious ways, alcoholic ways,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.440]   work ways, family ways, beautiful ways, surgery ways.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.320]   Take 10 years off. Listen to this. I'll read you the thesis. The main thesis of this book,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.200]   Becker says, the main thesis of this book is that the fear of death haunts the human animal
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   like nothing else. It is a main spring of human activity, activity designed largely to avoid
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny for man.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.440]   Becker has no answer. He's just documenting this pervasive reality, this massive human effort to
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:56.320]   deny, deny this reality of death. Jesus has an answer. His answer is to, number one, say, "I am
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.800]   God." Number two, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us full of grace and truth."
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:19.440]   Number three, "I lay down my life for my people and cover all their sin and provide all their
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:29.360]   righteousness." Number four, "I conquer death, and I conquer Satan who has the power of death."
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:41.680]   Number five, "I rise from the dead." Number six, "I take away the fear of dying." That's Jesus' answer.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.560]   Hebrews and Becker, Ernest Becker, and the writer of the Hebrews,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:58.720]   both say that the fear of death produces pervasive, lifelong slavery. Don't miss that.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.480]   See at the end of verse 15 in Hebrews 2, "I came to deliver those who through fear of death were
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.640]   subject to lifelong slavery." You may not think that. He does. I believe. I'm going to agree with
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:21.440]   him, not you. John Piper, "Until grace does a miracle," is subconsciously driven to deny my death.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   There are things in your life right now that are owing to the fear of death that you don't know
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   are owing to the fear of death, and that if you could have this stunning liberation
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   from the fear of death, there would come into your life a kind of freedom and a kind of
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   risk-taking, adventuresomeness for God that would change almost everything in your life.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   It is haunting our choices, making us cautious and wary and restrained and confined and narrow
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.880]   and tight and robbing us from risk and adventure and dreams for the sake of Christ and the kingdom
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   and the cause of love in the world. Why do you live such cautious lives? Why do you devote so
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:31.760]   much energy to security? It's just absurd if the one who said, "Before Abraham was, I am," said,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:44.960]   "You keep my word, you'll never die, ever." You have entered life. You have passed out of death.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:57.360]   You have moved around judgment. You are hidden with Christ in God. It cannot be ended. It cannot
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:06.320]   be interrupted. What are you afraid of? Beautiful, freeing, and motivating. That was a clip from
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   John Piper's sermon, "You Will Never See Death," preached on May 14th, 2011. It was suggested to
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.960]   us by Timothy White of San Diego, California. Thank you, Timothy, for the suggestion. You can
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   find the full message on our site, along with a couple thousand other messages like this one from
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.120]   John Piper in our sermon archive at desiringgod.org. On Wednesdays, we dive into the archive and pull
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.600]   out a classic clip. And if you have a favorite clip from a John Piper sermon, email us the title
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.440]   of the sermon and if possible, the timestamp of when and where the clip occurs in the audio. Put
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.160]   the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.400]   What happens when a pastor of an evangelical church thinks it's a good idea to officiate a
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.320]   so-called same-sex marriage? What does an elder board do in response? Pastor John will think
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.960]   through a tough question faced by one church right now. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.760]   tomorrow.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:04.800]   you
