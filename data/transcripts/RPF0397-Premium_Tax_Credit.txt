[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we continue our health insurance series by tackling a
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.660]   technical financial planning topic.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.080]   Today we discuss the premium tax credit.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.200]   I intend to do it in a fairly detailed way, explain to you what it is, how it works, and
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.080]   how it can benefit you.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.320]   This topic is one that can make a huge difference to your finances if you are in the low to
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880]   middle income classification of income levels.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.600]   This is the tax credit that was enacted as a component of the Affordable Care Act, where
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.080]   it was put in place to help low and middle income people be able to afford health insurance,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:58.840]   and its potential benefits are substantial.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.080]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I am your host.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   Today we tackle this premium tax credit.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.960]   This is a fun one, and it's a potentially very large one, somewhat simple, somewhat
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   complex.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.200]   Today I'm going to give you enough of an overview that I think you'll feel confident approaching
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040]   this subject for yourself.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.360]   If you think back to how the Affordable Care Act was enacted, there were a couple of things
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   that were going into play.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.360]   Number one is that one of the major goals of legislators was to pass a law that would
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.520]   enable, that would reduce the number of uninsured people, basically.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.800]   That was one of the fundamental goals.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.920]   The idea was that health expenses are too high, doctor bills are too high, and so everybody
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760]   needs some form of health insurance coverage.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   There are a few ways of skinning this cat.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.980]   Number one way was to require everybody to own health insurance.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.680]   That was one component of it.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.960]   But in order to require everyone to own health insurance, they had to figure out a way to
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.680]   be able to make that financially feasible for people who don't otherwise own health
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   insurance.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.960]   There were two aspects to that.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.060]   Number one is they had to remove the ability of the insurance companies to screen people
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.440]   based upon criteria that they would find acceptable, to screen people based upon preexisting conditions,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   et cetera.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.080]   Number two is they had to figure out a way to help people to pay for it, to help people
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.840]   to pay for the insurance coverage that was going to be provided for them.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   It was decided to do that through the primary use of a premium assistance tax credit.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   That was how the financial component was to be addressed.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.000]   The way that coverage was going to be offered to all was to set up either a state or a federally
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.840]   run health insurance exchange where health insurance policies are open to everybody during
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.240]   the normal enrollment periods, but they're open to everybody without any screening of
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.960]   medical preexisting conditions, et cetera.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now for those of you in the early retirement financial independence space, these couple
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.680]   of things joined together create a tremendous opportunity for you.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.880]   See when they limited the medical requirements to be able to obtain health insurance, that
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.960]   made it far easier for people like you and me to disconnect our health insurance coverage
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.120]   from our job without the fear of not being able to get good coverage in the future.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.640]   Now if you had coverage, this was always possible before the Affordable Care Act.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.560]   For example, if I had previously been working in a job that provided health insurance, I
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.800]   could transition to another job that provided health insurance and as long as I didn't lapse
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   my coverage, my preexisting conditions would still be covered.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.640]   I could even do this to some extent in the individual health insurance marketplace as
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.880]   well, but I had to maintain that continuity of coverage.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.140]   The challenge would be, well, what if I dropped my coverage?
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.560]   How do I get coverage again?
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.200]   Well, if you dropped your coverage under the system of preexisting conditions, you would
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.800]   have to have a waiting period even when enrolling sometimes in a group plan or you would be
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   declined coverage completely if you were going to enroll in some sort of individual health
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.480]   insurance policy.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.200]   That made things difficult for people who had preexisting conditions.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.880]   Now it made the insurance marketplace work relatively effectively.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.760]   See if an insurance company is not able to screen out risks, that means that they experience
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.840]   something that's called adverse selection.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   The idea here is that they know that people who are more likely to need the benefits from
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.400]   the policy will buy insurance and people who are healthier, who are less likely to need
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.080]   benefits from the policy will probably not buy the insurance.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.800]   The people who would love to buy life insurance are those who were just diagnosed with cancer.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.560]   Those people would – man, if I could underwrite people that bought cancer and I had a life
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   insurance company that would take them, I could stand outside a cancer ward and I could
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.760]   just do business all day long.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.920]   But of course, people who are just diagnosed with cancer generally can't get life insurance.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.780]   It's too late.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.240]   And so that's how an insurance company keeps their insurance business working based upon
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.920]   having actuarially sound database, having people that are representative of the general
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.160]   population.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.680]   You can't expose a marketplace to adverse selection.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.840]   So that was the fear that insurance companies had was they can't expose their business
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   to sick people because they know that sick people are much more likely to sign up for
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   and purchase health insurance.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.560]   So in order to require that, that was why those two things had to go together that the
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.160]   Affordable Care Act legislation promised was number one, everybody has to be covered and
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.880]   then number two, everybody has to purchase coverage or there's a penalty.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.720]   We'll deal with the penalties another day.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.880]   But this has actually been one of the major influences that has led to the problems that
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.040]   the health insurance marketplace has experienced since the passage of the Affordable Care Act
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.680]   with the significant increases in premium.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.740]   All of the sick people who previously couldn't get health insurance coverage quickly signed
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.380]   up for health insurance.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.080]   That adjusted the underlying premiums and as the premiums have increased, people who
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.340]   were healthy and who generally didn't need it, many of those people have opted to forego
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.180]   insurance completely.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.480]   So that's led to some of the problems that we face today.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.160]   But the fact that anybody can get health insurance regardless of health conditions, preexisting
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   health conditions, is an incredible opportunity that you may be able to utilize or you may
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   even be able to exploit.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.400]   For example, many in my audience are pursuing some kind of transition plan where they want
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   to go and leave one job and take a time off, take a sabbatical.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.520]   Or some in my audience have a desire to leave their job and retire completely.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.360]   Well if you're under the age of 65 and don't have access to Medicare, previously that was
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   difficult.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   But today, you're good to go.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.640]   I mean today, it's even better where even if you choose to not own health insurance
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.840]   at all and if you develop some kind of significant medical problem, you wouldn't be covered during
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   that period of time.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   But at any point during the time that you have that problem until open enrollment were
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.960]   to open up for the federal and state health insurance exchanges.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.320]   But even if you didn't bother to buy health insurance, you could just simply step in and
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.160]   buy health insurance during the open enrollment period at the end of the year.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.600]   And they can't exclude you because they can't exclude anybody with pre-existing conditions.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.320]   So that was a major, major change in the health insurance business.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.700]   Time will tell what ends up happening.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.360]   It has made a tremendous negative financial impact on the insurance companies in terms
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.800]   of their performance of their policies as I understand the news reports and things that
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.440]   I read.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.920]   The hope was that by enrolling additional insureds, that negative financial impact would
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.900]   be made up and that's what's unclear at the moment.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.400]   And then with the election of Donald Trump as president with his promise to repeal and
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.680]   replace Obamacare, many things are unclear at the moment.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.100]   So we're just going to deal with the law as it stands today and time will tell how long
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.000]   this information is helpful and accurate.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.640]   But that covers the health side.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.440]   What about the financial side?
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.680]   Knowing that you can't require people to buy something and not make it financially
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.320]   affordable and also knowing that major risk of adverse selection for people who just say,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.520]   "Well, I know I can just sign up anytime," those two things had to be solved with some
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.720]   kind of financial planning idea.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.480]   And so the idea that was launched and was passed was the premium tax credit.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.800]   And so the idea here is that a large number of low and middle income people who are buying
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:23.120]   health insurance through the government exchanges are eligible for a premium tax credit.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.400]   And this is a significant percentage of the population, especially when measured by income.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.000]   The first thing I want to talk about is eligibility.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.420]   And here I'm going to go down through some questions that are on one of the IRS's flow
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.640]   chart for – it's called the premium tax credit flow chart.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.480]   Are you eligible?
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.840]   And the very first most important question to ask is this.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:53.280]   Did you or a family member enroll in insurance through the marketplace, through healthcare.gov,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.880]   through the marketplace?
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.040]   If no, then you are not eligible for the premium tax credit.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.720]   That's the first thing.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.840]   So if you are enrolled in an employer plan, if you do what I do and you're involved in
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.200]   a health sharing ministry organization, if you don't have health insurance or if you've
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.920]   enrolled in health insurance in some way other than through the marketplace at healthcare.gov,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.600]   then you are not eligible for the premium tax credit.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.220]   So that's important.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   Next question.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.200]   If yes, if you did enroll through the marketplace, we go to the next question.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.800]   Are you and every member of your family eligible for coverage through an employer or government
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.740]   plan?
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.680]   Are you and every member of your family eligible for coverage through an employer or government
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.740]   plan?
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.200]   If you are protected by a government plan or an employer plan, if the coverage has been
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.840]   offered to you, then – if the answer to that question is yes, meaning the coverage
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:58.200]   has been offered to you, then you are not eligible for the premium tax credit.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.720]   So you can't – if any coverage – if the coverage that's – and we'll cover that
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.020]   in a little bit – has to be – meet certain standards for affordability.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.040]   But vast majority, if your employer is offering you health insurance coverage, you will not
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.720]   be able to get this premium tax credit.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.640]   But if you're not offered coverage, we go on to the next question.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:25.320]   Is your household income at least 100% but no more than 400% of the federal poverty line
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.560]   for your family size?
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.800]   Now this is a chart which I can't reproduce in a verbal format for you.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.400]   But the numbers for the federal poverty line level, these are updated every year and they
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.840]   do depend on household size.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.660]   So as an example, the current – meaning the 100% federal poverty level for a household
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.820]   of one, you as an individual, is an annual income of $11,770.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:58.360]   So if you make at least $11,770, you have the opportunity to participate in this tax
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.980]   credit and you can earn up to four times that amount which would be $47,080 as a household
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.780]   of one and still be eligible for some amount of the premium tax credit.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.780]   If you're below that 100% of the federal poverty level number, then you will not be
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.660]   eligible for this premium tax credit but you will be moving over into Medicaid eligibility.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.900]   So although you will not be eligible for the credit, you still aren't going to be paying
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.140]   much or anything for health insurance coverage.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.140]   Now as the household size increases, these numbers increase.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:39.100]   So for example, a household of four, husband, wife, two children, household of four, the
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:45.020]   federal poverty level for that household size is $24,250.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.700]   And 400% of that would go up to as high as $97,000.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   So if you're a family – let me just go through some household sizes here.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.140]   Household size of one, the range is 11,770.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.900]   I'm going to round these numbers.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.220]   The range is 12,000 up to 47,000.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.940]   Household size of two, the range is 16,000 up to $64,000.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.820]   Household size of three is 20,000 up to $80,000.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.680]   Household size of four is 24,000 up to $97,000.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:24.840]   Household size of five is 29,000 up to $113,000.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.460]   Household size of six would be anywhere from $32,000 to $130,000.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.500]   And it would go up from there.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.180]   So those of you who have larger families, household size of eight would be up to $163,000
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.880]   which is 400% of the federal poverty level for that size of household and you're still
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.300]   eligible for some amount of the premium tax credit.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.060]   For each additional child beyond there, there's an extra $4,000 on the bottom end and up to
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.960]   $16,000 on the top end.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.660]   So you can calculate that beyond there if you have a large household.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.660]   So this premium tax credit assistance means that you can get some amount that's scaled
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.240]   depending on where you are on that chart.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.940]   And this amount can be relatively substantial.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.900]   So if your household income falls into one of those areas, then yes, you may qualify
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.600]   for the premium tax credit.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.500]   Now here's the next question on the flow chart.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.940]   Can you be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return?
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.660]   If yes, you're not eligible for the premium tax credit.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.000]   If no, you are not claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, then you might
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.920]   be eligible.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   Next would be is your filing status married filing separately?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.520]   If you file as married filing separately, unless – there's one exception, two exceptions.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.760]   Unless a tiny exception for spouses who are not – no, I was going to say for spouses
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.680]   who are married persons living apart but they would file as unmarried.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.340]   The only exception is if you are the victim of domestic abuse or a spousal abandonment.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.920]   Then you can file a return as married filing separately and you will be eligible for the
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   premium tax credit.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.020]   But beyond that, unless you meet that definition of a victim of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment,
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.600]   you will not be able to file and receive this tax credit if you are married filing separately.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.800]   All else single, married filing jointly, et cetera, everything else is covered.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.180]   Next were all the premiums paid is the next question.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.080]   If no, not all the premiums were paid, then you're not eligible for the tax credit.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.360]   If yes, then you may be allowed a premium tax credit.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.080]   So those are the basic things that you need to be aware of for eligibility for this.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.520]   If you – and I'll run through them again very quickly.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.380]   If you don't qualify, this will be largely intellectual for you, academic, or you may
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.620]   just want to skip from here.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.400]   If you do qualify, then pay attention to the information in today's show.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.560]   So again, did you enroll through the marketplace?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   You must have enrolled through the marketplace.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.680]   The answer is yes.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:00.760]   Are you and any of your family members eligible for coverage through an employer or government
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   fund?
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.440]   You have to not be eligible for coverage elsewhere.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.760]   Is your household income at least 100% but no more than 400% of the federal poverty line?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.000]   If your household income is higher than that number, you will not be eligible for the premium
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.380]   tax credit.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.840]   You can't be claimed as dependent on someone else's tax return.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.440]   You can't file as married filing separately and you have to pay all the premiums for your
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.600]   insurance.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.840]   If those things are covered, then your premium tax credit may be available to you.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:34.000]   Let's talk about those income bands because with regard to eligibility, that will make
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.320]   the biggest difference for many of you, saying, "How do I fit into that 100% to 400% of the
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.000]   federal poverty level if I want to take advantage of this tax credit?"
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Those income bands are measured based upon modified adjusted gross income.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.360]   Now anytime you see this word modified adjusted gross income, there's no formal definition
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.120]   of modified adjusted gross income that's universally applicable.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   The adjusted gross income will come directly from your tax return.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.280]   It will be line 37, which is the front page of your 1040 bottom line.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.660]   That is your adjusted gross income.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.520]   But then it's going to be modified in some way and the way that it's modified will depend
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:23.540]   on what tax credit we're talking about or what particular rule that we're discussing.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:31.580]   In this case, for the premium tax credit, the modified adjusted gross income is your
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:38.560]   adjusted gross income plus any income that wasn't reported due to the foreign earned
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.480]   income or housing cost assistance exclusions plus any tax exempt interest, for example,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.100]   muni bond income, and any social security benefits that were excluded from the income
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.420]   for other reasons.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:00.840]   Those numbers need to be added back to calculate your modified adjusted gross income.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.560]   So we'll pause right here for a moment.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.680]   If you look at your adjusted gross income number and if that number is within the range,
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.360]   then you're going to be good to go.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.000]   Of course, the lower the better because you'll be able to get a higher tax credit.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.780]   But recognize that there are a number of things that come into play with your adjusted gross
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.780]   income.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.080]   So first of all, remember that all of the forms of income have been listed here, but
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.300]   that some of the forms of income that are listed at the top of your 1040 will be flowing
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:39.560]   onto this form after a business return.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:46.480]   So that's an important reason why I recommend to you that you make sure that you be better
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.540]   off when it comes to tax planning by owning and operating a business.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.200]   Because if you can entitle yourself to some number of business deductions, that will have
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.460]   an impact up front on offsetting some of your business income.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.960]   Also recognize that there are other aspects of your investments and other aspects of your
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.860]   business and investment activities that are already calculated.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:12.480]   So for example, your real estate income might flow flows in as income, but it flows in as
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.000]   income after you've taken your depreciation expenses.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.720]   Those are all helpful for getting your income down.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.640]   Secondly, you should notice that your adjusted gross income is arrived at by taking your
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.200]   total gross income and adjusting it for certain deductions.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.760]   Again, just reading from the front of the 1040, those deductions, those adjustments
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.360]   will be educator expenses, some business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:48.160]   basis government officials, health savings account deductions, moving expenses, deductible
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.200]   part of self-employment tax, self-employed SEP simple and qualified plans, self-employed
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   health insurance deduction, penalty on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deductions,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:08.160]   student loan interest deductions, tuition and fees, domestic production activities deduction,
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.700]   and that's the extent of the lines.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.120]   Those are all deducted before you arrive at your adjusted gross income.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   Why is this important?
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.080]   Well, the people who've got the sweet spot with regard to tax planning are those who
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.840]   can live on a relatively low amount of money, but who can earn a much higher amount of money.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.400]   When you come to something like the premium tax credit, if you can figure out a way to
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.560]   earn a higher amount of money, have some amount of that income sheltered by depreciation expenses,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.840]   business expenses, capital improvement expenses, and set up by having low expenses, you can
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.280]   save a significant amount of your income, set up aggressive savings plans through tax-deferred
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:54.760]   and tax-deductible savings plans such as IRAs, SEP simples, 401(k)s, etc.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.440]   If you have options of those things, you can get your income relatively low.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:06.620]   And this tax credit is one where if you're buying your health insurance through the federal
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:12.260]   health insurance exchange, this tax credit is one that can add up significantly in terms
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.440]   of actual benefits received.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.600]   You'll have to run the math for yourself and on your own situation.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.440]   But if you have, like I do, a family of four and you're saying, "Okay, how much would it
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.700]   cost for me to get the insurance coverage?"
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.340]   Find out what the cost is without the premium tax credit, then find out what your cost would
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.480]   be with your premium tax credit, and see if there's a way where you can maximize the premium
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.160]   tax credit.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.600]   And by maximizing it and getting your income to the point where it can be maximized, you
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.800]   may find a substantial savings there.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.080]   And what also you should pay attention to is that the premium tax credit is actually
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.440]   a refundable tax credit.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.400]   So if you're good with other aspects of your health, excuse me, your tax planning, it's
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   my understanding that this credit is a refundable credit, which you may be able to use to get
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.800]   more out than you put in.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.200]   So not all the tax credits are refundable, but this one is.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.400]   And so you should calculate it carefully and look at your situation carefully.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.640]   So how does the credit actually work?
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:21.080]   Well, the basic goal of the credit is to limit the premiums that you pay to the health insurance
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.800]   marketplace, to your health insurer that you purchase through a marketplace, to a certain
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.400]   percentage of your income.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.800]   So there are two aspects of it.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:39.440]   Most uniquely, this is a credit that can actually be paid to the insurance company.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   When it's done in the language of the IRS, this is what's called the advanced premium
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.760]   tax credit.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.680]   That's where they advance it to the health insurance company so that your out-of-pocket
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.320]   payment is very low.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.100]   And then everything has to be settled and reconciled at the end of the year when you
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.920]   file your tax return, but the credit was advanced to the insurance company.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   So if you were to go to the markethealthcare.gov right now during open enrollment and you sign
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.240]   up for a plan, normally your plan is going to cost you $600 a month.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.320]   But because of your eligibility for the premium tax credit, the marketplace system calculates
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.640]   that based upon the data that you enter, you will be eligible for a $300 a month tax credit,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.240]   a total of a $3,600 tax credit.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.840]   You will not have to pay the insurance company $600 and collect your $3,600 at the end of
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.160]   the year.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.000]   You wouldn't have to pay them $600 a month and then collect your one-time credit of $3,600
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   at the end of the year.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.360]   Rather, you'll just simply pay the insurance company $300 per month ongoing.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.160]   And then when you file your taxes next year, that number will be reconciled.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.840]   And if your income increased dramatically, then you'll owe the government more money
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.880]   because your credit went down.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.600]   Or if your income decreased or some other family situation changed, then you'll get
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   a larger refund from them because you were eligible for more of a credit.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:12.720]   That's how functionally it works with the system of the advanced premium tax credit.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.640]   I'm not aware of any other tax credit that works like this in the sense of it being on
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.560]   an advanced basis.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.800]   All of the other tax credits that I'm aware of presently, all of these function on the
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.400]   basis of when you actually file your return.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.840]   That's when the credits are calculated and that's when you receive the benefit for them.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:39.640]   The functional goal of the credit, the way that they calculate the premiums, is to keep
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.120]   the premium level at a certain target of your income.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.800]   So starting off at 100% of the federal poverty level, that number, so again, where's my chart?
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.760]   Family of four, that would be if you have a household income of about $25,000 per year,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.680]   then the goal of the premium tax credit is to limit your health insurance premiums to
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.200]   about 2% of your income.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   And this would increase.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:10.360]   Let's say you're at 200% of the federal poverty level, well, 200% of the federal poverty level
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:17.680]   for that family of four, then at this, which would put you at $48,500 of annual income,
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.160]   then they're trying to limit your premiums to about 5% of your income.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.720]   Or if you're at the higher amounts, where let's say you're up at three or three to 400%
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.200]   of the federal poverty level income, again, family of four, that's going to put you between
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.140]   $73,000 and $97,000.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.500]   Then they're trying to limit your premiums that you're paying for health insurance to
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.160]   about 9.5% of your income.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.200]   That means that this credit is one that is much, much, much more valuable for those with
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.480]   a low income than for those with a high income.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.320]   And it's substantially weighted towards being much more valuable for the low income, the
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.780]   person who reports a low income.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.480]   The reason for this is the underlying benchmark is not something that's based upon income,
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.620]   but rather something that's based upon a flat expense.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.800]   The credit is calculated as the excess of the premium cost for what they call a benchmark
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.640]   plan over the threshold amounts that I just read to you, those ranges.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.680]   I'm trying to use fewer numbers on an audio show.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.000]   It's relatively simple when you fill out the forms.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.880]   Just grasp the concept.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.560]   So they calculate the excess of the premium cost as much as it costs over that percentage
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.880]   amount.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.960]   And the higher the percentage amount, the more the credit is.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.240]   Now the benchmark plan cost is not going to change.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.800]   That's going to be the second lowest cost silver plan that's available on the exchange
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.160]   to cover your entire household based upon the age and where you live and the number
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.220]   of people in the family.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.040]   So that will change significantly depending on where you live and what type of market
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.520]   you're in locally.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   Incidentally, they don't change it based upon smokers.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.060]   So if you're a smoker, you're going to pay a higher amount than those who are non-smokers
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.460]   is based upon non-tobacco use.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's what the benchmark plan is.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   So they'll calculate that as the second lowest cost silver plan in your marketplace and then
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.520]   they'll take everything from the cost that goes above that target percentage.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.840]   Again, that target percentage ranged from 2% to 9.5% of your income depending on which
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.320]   of those tiers you ranged into.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.220]   And the credit will be as much as everything above that.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.840]   Because of this reality, it's led to a very interesting scenario in our current day and
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.520]   with all the arguments over the Affordable Care Act.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:49.440]   As premium costs have increased for the actual policies, thus because the cost of insurance
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:55.080]   have gone up, the actual amount of money out of pocket for the majority of people who are
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:02.640]   receiving subsidies, which is the majority of people on the Affordable Care Act exchange,
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:10.000]   those out-of-pocket rates are not increasing as much as the underlying premiums are increasing.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.520]   It's because the credit amounts are not tied to the actual expenses of the insurance.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.860]   They're tied to the federal poverty level with the goal of keeping them down.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:26.940]   So in essence, the taxpayers who are subsidizing the premium tax credit here are the ones who
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.320]   are picking up the bill for the increasing premiums.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   That's why there's such a disconnect often, depending on what articles you're reading
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   about the changes in the premiums for Affordable Care Act policies.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.080]   A couple of things also to point out about these brackets.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.240]   First, this bracket, if you are near the top end of a range and if you're eligible for
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.360]   the premium tax credit assistance, for the premium tax credit, if you're near that 400%
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:03.480]   number, you should be aware that there is a massive cliff and it is probably within
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.200]   your best interest not to go over that cliff in terms of the actual amount of money that
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.760]   you are earning.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:18.280]   Let's say as an example here that you are a family of four and for a family of four,
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.720]   400% of the poverty level would be $97,000 per year.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:31.080]   Well, if you come in with a modified adjusted gross income of $96,999, your premiums will
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.880]   be limited to 9.5% of your income.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:47.680]   If we run the math for $96,999, 9.5%, that means that any costs over $9,214.91 out of
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.560]   your pocket, any costs out of that will be picked up by this tax credit.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:00.360]   You'll be paying a total of $9,200 per year or $767 per month, but anything over that
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.760]   is going to be picked up by this premium tax credit.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:13.160]   But if you earn $97,001 as your modified adjusted gross income, that means the total cost of
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.680]   the policy will be borne by you and you'll lose all of it.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.000]   So that could be a difference of say something like a $3,000 or $4,000 tax bill.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:34.720]   If the cost was $99,000 with the tax credit but the actual cost of the policy is $12,000,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.200]   then if you go a dollar over a $97,000 income, you'll wind up with an extra $3,000 expense
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.680]   out of your pocket.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.240]   So be very careful of that if you're near that 400% number.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.600]   And if, again, all those caveats apply, if you're receiving your insurance through the
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.180]   exchange, etc., don't go over that 400% number.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.160]   Take a month off and work less and you'll come out ahead just by being under that number.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.320]   There is a cliff there.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.260]   I think that tip can actually apply to a number of you in the audience that I know are fine
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   income earners.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:11.160]   Due to your family size, you can live on a lower amount, but yet the cost of health insurance
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   is significant.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.760]   So pay attention to that and see if there's a way to use that.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.000]   The other thing you need to pay attention to, of course, is that all of these things
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.960]   are based upon income.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.040]   All of these calculations are based upon income, not on assets.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:32.920]   And there is no asset test for this tax credit just like anything else.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.680]   You may have millions of dollars under your control, but as long as you're not recognizing
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.960]   income from that, you will be qualified for this potential tax credit.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   So for many of you who are very good at keeping expenses down and who are very good at controlling
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.160]   the income that your portfolio is throwing off of, this should make a big difference
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.920]   for you.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.600]   So as a matter of planning, basically you got three groups of people.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.800]   If you're making more than 400% of the federal poverty level of income for your household
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.060]   size, you're going to pay for the full cost of the insurance with no tax credit.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:13.800]   If you're between 133% and 400%, then there's going to be a sliding credit available to
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   you.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.560]   And if you're below 133% of that federal poverty level, that's where you are basically not
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.840]   going to pay any premiums and you're going to be covered by Medicaid.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.040]   So that's where you want to pay attention to what bracket you're in and what bracket
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   you're considering.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.280]   I think I've covered enough here for today.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:40.360]   If you're interested more on the premium tax credit, publication 974 is the document that
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.240]   you want from the IRS, publication 974.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:49.040]   I will link it in the show notes for today's show directly over to the IRS.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   I've read it through.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:58.000]   There are other details that I could go into, but there are just really not – there are
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.440]   no other major planning benefits that I've found, no other major ways to exploit this
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.800]   credit for your benefit.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   I've shared with you the best I know.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.840]   So feel free to go and read it, but I think all the other details that are there are just
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.800]   not relevant enough to the audience as a whole to be worth it.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.320]   But definitely, this is something that you should pay attention to and this is one of
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.200]   those – the benefit can be substantial.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.320]   So pay careful attention to this premium tax credit.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.200]   We'll be continuing the health insurance series.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.440]   The next one that I am planning is to talk about the penalty.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.720]   If you don't have health insurance, who is eligible for an exemption from the penalty,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.880]   how to get out of it, what happens if you don't pay the penalty, talk about some of
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   the strategies.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.480]   I plan at some point here to talk about health savings accounts.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:51.920]   I'll also talk about healthcare sharing ministries, a number of other episodes in
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.960]   this series as well.
