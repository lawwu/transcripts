[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The following is a conversation with Magnus Carlsen,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.360]   the number one ranked chess player in the world
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.720]   and widely considered to be one of,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.340]   if not the greatest chess player of all time.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.480]   The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.920]   Most folks still just listen to the audio
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.760]   through a podcast player anyway,
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.120]   but if you're watching this on YouTube or Spotify,
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   we did our best to still make it interesting
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.060]   by adding relevant image overlays.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.120]   "I mess things up sometimes, like in this case,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.480]   "but I'm always working hard to improve.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.680]   "I hope you understand.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.840]   "Thank you for your patience and support along the way.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.920]   "I love you all."
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.440]   in the description.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.920]   And now, dear friends, here's Magnus Carlsen.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.720]   You're considered by many to be one of the greatest,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200]   if not the greatest chess players of all time,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360]   but you're also one of the best fantasy football,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240]   AKA soccer, competitors in the world,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.640]   plus recently picking up poker
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.320]   and competing at a world-class level.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.880]   So before chess, let's talk football and greatness.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.920]   You're a Real Madrid fan,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.520]   Who do you think is the greatest football,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760]   AKA soccer player of all time?
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.280]   Can you make the case for Messi?
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.240]   Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.720]   PelÃ©, Maradona?
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.880]   Does anybody jump to mind?
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.840]   - I think it's pretty hard to make a case
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840]   for anybody else than Messi for his all-around game.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.280]   And frankly, my Real Madrid fandom
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   sort of predates the Ronaldo era,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.440]   the second Ronaldo, not the first one.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.920]   So I always liked Ronaldo,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.640]   but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.200]   And I went to quite a number of Madrid games
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.760]   and they've always been super helpful to me down there.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.840]   The only thing is that, like, they asked me,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   they were gonna do an interview
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.000]   and they were gonna ask me who my favorite player was.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.320]   And I said somebody else,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   I think I said Isco at that point,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.600]   and I was like, "Okay, take two."
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480]   Now you say Ronaldo.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.600]   So for them, it was very important,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   but it wasn't that huge to me.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.080]   - So Messi over Maradona.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.480]   - Yeah, but I think just like with chess,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   it's hard to compare eras.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.280]   Obviously the improvements in football have been,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.080]   like, in technique and such have been even greater
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.240]   than they have been in chess,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   but it's always a weird discussion to have.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.320]   - But just as a fan,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.400]   what do you think is beautiful about the game?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   What defines greatness?
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.160]   Is it, you know, with Messi,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   one, he's really good at finishing,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.280]   two, very good at assist,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.640]   like three, there's just magic.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   It's just beautiful to see the play.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.960]   So it's not just about the finishing.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.800]   There's some, it's like Maradona's hand of God.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.240]   There's some creativity on the pitch.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.840]   Is that important or is it very important
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.200]   to get the World Cups and the big championships
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.240]   and that kind of stuff?
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.120]   - I think the World Cup is pretty overrated
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.640]   seeing as it's such a small sample size.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.400]   So it sort of annoys me always when, you know,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.960]   titles are always appreciated so much,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   even though that particular title can be a lot of luck
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.160]   or at least some luck.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   So I do appreciate the statistics a bit
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   and all the statistics say that Messi's
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.840]   the best finisher of all time,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.440]   which I think helps a lot.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.400]   And then there's the intangibles as well.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.120]   - The flip side of that is the small sample size
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.080]   is what really creates the magic.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.680]   It's so, it's just like the Olympics.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.240]   You basically train your whole life for this.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.560]   You live your whole life for this.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   And it's a rare moment, one mistake and it's all over.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.920]   That's for some reason, a lot of people
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   either break under that pressure
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.920]   or rise up under that pressure.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   You don't admire the magic of that?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.920]   - No, I do.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   I just think that like rising under pressure
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   and breaking under the pressure
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.640]   is often a really oversimplified,
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.400]   like take on what's happening.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.200]   - Yeah, we do romanticize the game.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   - Yeah.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.880]   - Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.840]   You're also a fan of basketball.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.680]   - Yes.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.720]   - Let me ask the goat question.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.960]   I'm biased because I went to high school in Chicago,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.400]   Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.360]   Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.240]   Let's continue on this thread of greatness.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   Which one do you pick or somebody else?
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   - So I'll give you a completely different answer.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.600]   - Uh-oh.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.440]   - Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.600]   I pick one of the two and then I try to argue for that.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.720]   - It's a quantum mechanical thing.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.600]   Well, can you, again, what would,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.680]   if you were to argue for either one?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.920]   Statistically, I think LeBron James
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   is going to surpass Jordan.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.880]   - Yeah, no doubt.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   - And so, again, there's a debate between--
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.800]   - Unquantifiable greatness, no?
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.160]   I mean, that's the whole debate.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.720]   - Yes, so it's, well, it's quantifiable
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.400]   versus unquantifiable.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.640]   What's more important?
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   And you're depending on mood all over the place.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.520]   But where do you lean in general with these folks,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.800]   with soccer, with anything in life,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   towards the unquantifiable more?
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.640]   - No, definitely towards the quantifiable.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   - So when you're unsure, lean towards the numbers.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.800]   But see, it's later generations.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.000]   There's something, that's what people say about Maradona,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   is he took arguably somewhat mediocre team to a World Cup.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.760]   So there's that also uplifting nature of the player
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.200]   to be able to rise up the whole, it is a team sport.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.080]   - So are you gonna punish Messi
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   for taking a mediocre Argentine squad to the final in 2014?
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.640]   And punish him because they lost to a great team
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.280]   very narrowly after they missed.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   - The internet does.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.760]   - He set up a great chance for Higuain in the first half,
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.560]   which he fluffed.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.200]   And then, yeah, eventually they lost the game.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   - Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   for being on really strong squads
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.920]   in terms of the club teams and saying,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   yeah, okay, it's easy when you have Ronaldinho
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.440]   or whoever on your team.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   - It would be very interesting
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.720]   just if the league could make a decision.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.800]   - Yeah, just random, random allocation.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.640]   - Yeah.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.360]   - And just every single game, just keep reallocating,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   or maybe once a season, or every season you get random.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.200]   - Yeah, but let's say every player,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.680]   if let's say they sign a five-year contract for a team,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.960]   like one of them, you're gonna get randomly allocated
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.960]   to let's say a bottom half team.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.040]   - I bet you there's gonna be so much corruption around that.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.000]   - No, obviously it wouldn't ever happen or work,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.680]   but I think it's interesting to think about.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.560]   - So on chess, let's zoom out.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.600]   If you break down your approach to chess,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.200]   when you're at your best,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   what do you think contributes to that approach?
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   Is it memory recall of specific lines and positions?
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.560]   Is it intuition?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   How much of it is intuition?
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.280]   How much of it is pure calculation?
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.360]   How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.240]   So the game theory aspect,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.600]   in terms of what contributes to the highest level of play
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.800]   that you do?
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.680]   - I think the answer differs a little bit now
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.840]   from what it did eight years ago, for instance.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   Like I feel like I've had like two peaks
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   in my career in 2014, well, 2013, 2014,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.600]   and also in 2019.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   And in those years, I was very different
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.120]   in terms of my strength.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.000]   Strength, specifically in 2019,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.560]   I benefited a lot from opening preparation.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   While in 2013, 2014,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   I mostly tried to avoid my opponent's preparation
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.120]   rather than that being a strength.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.720]   So I'm mentioning that also
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.360]   because it's something you didn't mention.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.520]   I think like my intuitive understanding of chess
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   has over those years always been a little bit better
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.040]   than the others, even though it has evolved as well.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.360]   Certainly there are things that I understand now
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.840]   that I didn't understand back then,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.080]   but that's not only for me, that's for others as well.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.040]   I was younger back then, so I played with more energy,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   which meant that I could play better
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.200]   in long drawn out games.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.240]   Which was also a necessity for me
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   'cause I couldn't beat people in the openings.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.960]   But in terms of calculation,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.720]   that's always been a weird issue for me.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.640]   Like I've always been really, really bad
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.920]   at solving exercises in chess.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.920]   Like that's been like a blind spot for me.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.240]   and to look deep enough.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.480]   - So this is like a puzzle, a position, mate in X.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.520]   - I mean, one thing is mate, but find the best move.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.920]   That's generally the exercise.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.480]   Like find the best move, find the best line.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.960]   - You just don't connect with it.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.880]   - Usually like you have to look deep.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   And then when I get these lines during the game,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   I very often find the right solution,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.120]   even though it's not still the best part of my game
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:17.080]   to calculate very, very deeply.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.880]   - But it doesn't feel like calculation you're saying?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.400]   In terms of- - No, it does sometimes,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.120]   but for me, it's more like I'm at the board
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.480]   trying to find the solution.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.200]   And I understand like the training at home
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.240]   is like trying a little bit to replicate that.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.280]   Like you give somebody half an hour in a position
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.320]   like in this instance, you might've thought
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.440]   for half an hour if you play the game.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.960]   I just cannot do it.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.800]   One thing I know that I am good at though
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.760]   is calculating short lines.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.040]   'Cause I calculate them well.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.640]   I'm good at seeing little details
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   and I'm also much better than most at evaluating,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.320]   which I think is something that sets me apart from others.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   - So evaluating specific position.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   If I make this move and the position changes in this way,
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.560]   is this a step in the right direction
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080]   like in a big picture way?
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.680]   - Yeah, like you calculate a few moves ahead
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   and then you evaluate.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.760]   Because a lot of the times you cannot,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.280]   the branches become so big
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.960]   that you cannot calculate everything.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.240]   So you have to- - Like a fog.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.160]   - Yeah, so you have to make evaluations
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   based mostly on knowledge and intuition.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.680]   And somehow I seem to do that pretty well.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.280]   - When you say you're good at short lines, what's that?
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.800]   What's short?
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   - That's usually like lines of two to four moves each.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.200]   - Okay, so that's directly applicable to even faster games
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.000]   like Blitz, Chess and so on.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   - Yeah, Blitz is a lot about calculating force lines.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.160]   So those, you can see pretty clearly
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.800]   that the players who struggle at Blitz
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.240]   who are great at classical
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.640]   are those who rely on a deep calculating ability.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.440]   'Cause you simply don't have time for that in Blitz.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.120]   You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.800]   - Can you try to, I know it's really difficult.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.360]   Can you try to talk through
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.320]   what's actually being visualized in your head?
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.240]   Is there a visual component?
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.320]   - Yeah, no, I just visualize the board.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.800]   I mean, the board is in my head.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.880]   - Two dimensional?
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.960]   - My interpretation is that it is two dimensional.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.080]   - Like what colors?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.720]   Is it brown tinted?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   Is it black?
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   Is it, like, what's the theme?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.240]   Is it a big board, small board?
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.840]   Are the, what do the pawns look like?
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.120]   Or is it more in the space of concepts?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.320]   Like, is this--
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.640]   - Yeah, there aren't a lot of colors.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.040]   It's mostly, yeah.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.040]   - So what is it, Queen's Gambit on the ceiling, whatever?
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.120]   - I don't know how to imagine it.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.680]   - What about when you do the branching,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.440]   when you have multiple boards and so on?
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.280]   How does that look?
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.000]   - No, but it's only one at a time.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.360]   - One position at a time.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.920]   - One position at a time, so then I go back.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.280]   And that's what, when people play,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.680]   or at least that's what I do.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.440]   When I play blindfold chess against several people,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.880]   then it's just always one board at a time,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.160]   and the rest are stored away somewhere.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.520]   - But how do you store them away?
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.600]   So like, you went down one branch,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.560]   and you're like, all right, I got that.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.520]   I understand that there's some good there,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.800]   there's some bad there.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.400]   Now let me go down another branch.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.680]   Like, how do you store away the information?
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.520]   You just put it on a shelf, kinda?
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.040]   - I try and store it away.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.480]   Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   And it does happen frequently in games
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.000]   that you're thinking for,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.600]   especially if you're thinking for long,
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.240]   let's say a half an hour, or even more than that,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.760]   that you play a move, and then your opponent plays a move,
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.200]   then you play a move, and they play a move again,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.160]   and you realize, oh, I actually calculated that.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.320]   I just forgot about it.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.360]   So that's obviously what happens
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.680]   when you store the information and you cannot retrieve it.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.200]   - When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.400]   like, how do you break that down?
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.800]   Can you describe what, like, what's the algorithm here
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.760]   that takes 30 minutes to run?
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.160]   - 30 minutes is, at least for me, it's usually a waste.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.080]   30 minutes usually means that I don't know what to do.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.800]   And I'm trying--
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.920]   - You're just running into the wall over and over.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   - Yeah, I'm trying to find something that isn't there.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.680]   I think 10 to 15 minutes things
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.040]   in complicated positions can be really, really helpful.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   Just means that the branches are getting wide.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   There's a lot to run through,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.320]   both in terms of calculation
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.040]   and lots you have to evaluate as well.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   And then based on that 10 to 15 minute thing,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.320]   you have a pretty good idea what to do.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.560]   I mean, it's very rare that I would think for half an hour
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.600]   and I would have a eureka moment during the game.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.560]   Like, if I haven't seen it in 10 minutes,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.800]   I'm probably not gonna see it at all.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.280]   - You're going to different branches.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.120]   - Yeah.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.880]   - And like after 15 minutes, it's like--
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.280]   - But it mainly to the middle game,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.120]   because when you get to the end game,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.320]   it's usually brute force calculation
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.920]   that makes you spend so much time.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.640]   So middle game is normally,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.520]   it's a complicated mix of brute force calculation
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   and like creativity and evaluation.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.040]   So end game, it's easier in that sense.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.320]   - Well, you're good at every aspect of chess,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.640]   but you're also, your end game is legendary.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.360]   It baffles experts.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.280]   So can you linger on that then?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   Try to explain what the heck is going on there.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.480]   Like, if you look at game six
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.520]   of the previous world championship,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.040]   the longest game ever played in chess,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.680]   what it was, I think,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.480]   his queen versus your rook, knight in two pawns.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.320]   - Yeah.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.280]   - There's so many options there.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   It's such an interesting little dance
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.240]   and it's kind of not obvious that it wouldn't be a draw.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.920]   So how do you escape it not being a draw
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.680]   and you win that match?
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   - No, I knew that for most of the time,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.760]   it was a theoretical draw.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.760]   Since chess with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.320]   So you can, like people watching online,
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   they can just check it.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.440]   They can check and they can check a so-called table base
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.560]   and it just gonna spit out win for white,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.040]   win for black or a draw.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.120]   So, and also I knew that,
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.320]   I knew that, didn't know that position specifically,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.720]   but I knew that it had to be a draw.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   So for me, it was about staying alert,
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.840]   first of all, trying to look for the best way
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.480]   to put my pieces.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.440]   But yeah, those end games are a bit,
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   they're a bit unusual.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.080]   They don't happen too often.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.360]   So what I'm usually good at is I'm using my strengths
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   that I also use in middle games is that I evaluate well
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.520]   and I calculate short variations quite.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.400]   - Even for the end game, short variations matter.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.800]   - Yes, it does matter in some simpler end games.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   Yeah, but also like there are these theoretical end games
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.280]   with very few pieces like rook knights
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.120]   and two pawns versus queens.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.600]   But a lot of end games are simply defined
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.760]   by the queens being exchanged.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.640]   And there are a lot of other pieces left
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   and then it's usually not brute force.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.080]   It's usually more of understanding and evaluation
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.760]   and then I can use my strengths very well.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.520]   - Why are you so damn good at the end game?
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.440]   Isn't there a lot of moves from when the end game starts
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.600]   to when the end game finishes and you have a few pieces
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.840]   and you have to figure out,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.480]   it's like a sequence of little games that happens, right?
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.440]   Like little pattern, like how does it being able
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.400]   to evaluate a single position lead you
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.840]   to evaluate a long sequence of position
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.800]   that eventually lead to a checkmate?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.640]   - Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.600]   you know what plans to go for.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.920]   And then usually the play from there
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.720]   is often pretty simple.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   Let's say you understand how to arrange your pieces
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.200]   and often also how to arrange your pawns early
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   in the end game, then that makes all the difference.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.480]   And after that is like what we call technique very often
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.640]   that it's technique basically just means
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.120]   that the moves are simple and these are moves
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.440]   that a lot of players could make.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.080]   Not only the very strongest ones,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.840]   these are moves that are kind of understood and known.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.120]   - So with the evaluation,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.240]   you're just constantly improving a little bit
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.840]   and that just leads to suffocating the position
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.080]   and then eventually to the win,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.520]   as long as you're doing the evaluation well,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.680]   one step at a time.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.880]   - To some extent.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.120]   Also, yeah, as I said, like if you evaluate it better
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.400]   and thus accumulated some small advantages,
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   then you can often make your life pretty easy
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.160]   towards the end of the end game.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.360]   - So you said in 2019, sort of the second phase
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.160]   of why you're so damn good,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.040]   you did a lot of opening preparation.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   What's the goal for you of the opening game of chess?
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Is it to throw the opponent off from any prepared lines?
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.080]   Is there something you could put into words
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.960]   about why you're so damn good at the openings?
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.000]   - Again, these things have changed a lot over time.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.200]   Back in Kasparov's days, for instance,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   he very often got huge advantages from the opening as white.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.120]   - Can you explain why?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.400]   - There were several reasons for that.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.520]   First of all, he worked harder.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.280]   He was more creative in finding ideas.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   He was able to look places others didn't.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.600]   Also, he had a very strong team of people
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   who had specific strengths in openings that he could use.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.000]   - So they would come up with ideas
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.760]   and he would integrate those ideas into-
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.840]   - Yeah, and he would also very often come up with them himself.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.840]   Also, at the start, he had some of the first
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:30.560]   computer engines to work for him to find his ideas,
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.360]   to look deeper, to verify his ideas.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.160]   He was better at using them than a lot of others.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   Now, I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.960]   There are both computer engines, neural networks,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.800]   and hybrid engines available to practically anybody.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   So it's much harder to find ideas now
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.280]   that actually give you an advantage
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.160]   with the white pieces.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.320]   I mean, people don't expect to find those ideas anymore.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   Now it's all about finding ideas that are missed
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.720]   by the engines, either they're missed entirely
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.960]   or they're missed at low depth,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   and using them to gain some advantage
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.360]   in the sense that you have more knowledge.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   And it's also good to know that usually
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.280]   these are not complete bluffs, these are like semi-bluffs
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.480]   so that you know that even if your opponent
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.240]   makes all the right moves, you can still make a draw.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.880]   And also at the start of 2019,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.600]   neural networks had just started to be a thing in chess.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.880]   And I'm not entirely sure,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.120]   but there were at least some players,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   even in the top events, who you could see did not use them
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.360]   or did not use them in the right way.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.840]   And then you could gain a huge advantage
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.600]   because a lot of positions,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.520]   they were being evaluated differently by the neural networks
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.920]   than traditional chess engines
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.800]   because they simply think about chess
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.640]   in a very, very different way.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.680]   So short answer is these days,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.160]   it's all about surprising your opponent
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.280]   and taking it into position where you have more knowledge.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.880]   - So is there some sense in which it's okay
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   to make suboptimal quote unquote moves?
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.200]   - No, but you have to.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.480]   I mean, you have to because the best moves
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.520]   have been analyzed to death mostly.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.600]   - So that's a kind of, when you say semi-bluff,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.560]   that's a kind of sacrifice.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   You're sacrificing the optimal move, the optimal position
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.920]   so that you can take the opponent.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.840]   I mean, that's a game theoretic sense.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   You take the opponent to something they didn't prepare well.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.360]   - Yeah, but you could also look at it another way
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   that regardless, like if you turn on,
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.200]   whatever engine you turn on,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.440]   like if you try to analyze either from the starting position
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.960]   or the starting position of some popular opening,
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.400]   like if you analyze long enough,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.360]   it's always gonna end up in a draw.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.160]   So in that sense, you may not be going
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.560]   for like the objective, the tries that are objectively
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.760]   the most difficult to draw against,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   but you are trying to look at least
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.400]   at the less obvious paths.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.680]   - How much do you use engines?
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.880]   Do you use Leela, Stockfish in your preparations?
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.600]   - My team does.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Personally, I try not to use them too much on my own
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.920]   because I know that when I play,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.960]   you obviously cannot have help from engines.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   And I feel like often having imperfect
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.760]   or knowledge about a position
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.160]   or some engine knowledge can be a lot worse
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.520]   than having no knowledge.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.400]   So I try to look at engines as little as possible.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.840]   - So yeah, so your team uses them for research,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.640]   for a generation of ideas,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   but you are relying primarily on your human resources.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.440]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.760]   - You can evaluate well, you don't lean.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.000]   - Yeah, I can evaluate as a human.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.320]   I can know what they find unpleasant and so on.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   And it's very often the case for me to some extent,
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.160]   but a lot for others that you arrive in a position
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.280]   and your opponent plays a move that you didn't expect.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.520]   And if you didn't expect it,
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.880]   you know that it's probably not a great move
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.520]   since it hasn't been expected by the engine.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.520]   But if it's not obvious why it's not a good move,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.840]   it's usually very, very hard to figure it out.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.360]   And so then looking at the engines doesn't necessarily help
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.880]   because at that point, like you're facing a human,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.040]   you have to sort of think as a human.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.920]   - I was chatting with Demis Hassabis,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.480]   CEO of DeepMind a couple of days ago,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.800]   and he asked me to ask you about what you first felt
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.920]   when you saw the play of AlphaZero.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.720]   Like interesting ideas, any creativity.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.840]   Were you inspired?
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.240]   And what was going on in your mind and heart?
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   - Funny thing about Demis is he doesn't play chess at all
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.240]   like an AI.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.560]   He plays in a very, very human way.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.360]   No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.200]   And in terms of man versus machine,
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.080]   I mean, that battle was kind of lost for humans
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   even before I entered top level chess.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.440]   So that's never been an issue for me.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.160]   I never liked playing as computers much anyway.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.080]   So that's completely fine,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   but it was amazing to see how they "thought about chess"
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.480]   and in such a different way
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.640]   and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.480]   - Mistake for creativity, strong words.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.400]   Is it wild to you how many sacrifices it's willing to make
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   that like sacrifice pieces
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.320]   and then wait for prolonged periods of time
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.960]   before doing anything with that?
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.480]   Is that weird to you that that's part of chess?
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.520]   - No, it's one of the things that's hardest to replicate
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.640]   as a human as well, or at least for my playing style
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.520]   that usually when I sacrifice, I feel like I'm, you know,
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.880]   I don't do it unless I feel like I'm getting something
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.240]   like tangible in return.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.360]   And-
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.960]   - Like a few moves down the line.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.200]   - A few moves down the line,
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.800]   you can see that you can either retrieve the material
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.240]   or you can put your opponent's king under pressure
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.680]   or have some very like very concrete positional advantage
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.520]   that sort of compensates for it.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.800]   For instance, in chess,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.640]   so bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   We both give them three points,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.360]   but bishops are a little bit better.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   And especially a bishop pair is a lot better
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.080]   than a bishop and a knight.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.440]   So, or especially two knights depends on the position,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.120]   but like on average they are.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   So like sacrificing a pawn in order to get a bishop pair,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.360]   that's one of the most common sacrifices in chess.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.560]   - Oh, you're okay making that sacrifice?
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it depends on the situation,
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.600]   but generally that's fine.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.040]   And there are a lot of openings that are based on that,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.320]   that you sacrifice a pawn for the bishop pair
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.360]   and then eventually it's some sort of positional equality.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.440]   So that's fine.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   But the way AlphaZero would sacrifice a knight
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.440]   or sometimes two pawns, three pawns,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.000]   and you could see that it's looking
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   for some sort of positional domination,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.320]   but it's hard to understand.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.840]   And it was really fascinating to see.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   Yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of pawns especially,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.560]   and it was a great joy.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.000]   Unfortunately, it's not so easy to continue to do that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.720]   People have found more solid opening lines
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.760]   since that don't allow me to do that as often.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.160]   I'm still trying both to get those positions
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   and still trying to learn the art of sacrificing pieces.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.200]   - So Demis also made a comment that was interesting
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   to my new chess brain,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.480]   which is one of the reasons that chess is fun
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.560]   is because of the, quote,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.440]   "creative tension between the bishop and the knight."
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.360]   So you're talking about this interesting difference
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.720]   between the two pieces,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.680]   but there's some kind of, how would you convert that?
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.400]   I mean, that's like a poetic statement about chess.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.520]   I think he said that,
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.000]   why has chess been played for such a long time?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.760]   Why is it so fun to play at every level?
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.600]   That if you can reduce it to one thing,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.240]   is it the bishop and the knight,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.360]   some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.440]   Is there any truth to that?
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.320]   - It sounds very good.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.000]   I haven't tried a lot of other games,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.440]   but I tried to play a little bit of shogi.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.160]   And for my new shogi brain, comparing it to chess,
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.760]   what annoyed me about that game
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.960]   is how much the pieces suck.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.480]   Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.840]   that move like in chess,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.720]   and the rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.560]   So I think that's one of the attractions of chess,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.400]   like how powerful, especially the queen is, which-
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.280]   - Interesting.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.480]   - I kind of think makes it, makes it a lot of fun.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   - So you think power is more fun than like variety?
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.480]   - No, there is variety in chess as well, though.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.600]   - But not much more so than like,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.280]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.680]   That's for-
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.520]   - So like knight, I mean, they all move in different ways.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.880]   They're all like weird.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.800]   There's just all these weird patterns
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.440]   and positions that can emerge.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.640]   The difference in the pieces
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.440]   create all kinds of interesting dynamics,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.480]   I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.400]   - Yeah.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.880]   And I guess it is quite fascinating
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.080]   that all those years ago,
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.280]   they created the knight and the bishop
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.680]   without probably realizing that they would be
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.640]   almost equally strong with such different qualities.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.560]   - That's crazy that this, you know,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.000]   like when you design computer games,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.120]   it's like an art form, it's science and an art to balance it.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.400]   You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.040]   like so that you can have competitive play
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.280]   at the highest level with all those different units.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.240]   And in the case of chess, it's different pieces
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.800]   and they somehow designed a game that was super competitive.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.520]   But there's probably some kind of natural selection
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.040]   that the chess just wouldn't last
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.560]   if it was designed poorly.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   - Yeah.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   And I think the rules have changed over time a little bit.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.680]   But I would be, I mean, speaking of games and all that,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   I'm also interested to play other games like chess 960
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.040]   or Fisher Random, as they call it,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.560]   like that you have 960 maps instead of one.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.400]   - Yeah, so for people who don't know,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.680]   a Fisher Random chess, chess 960 is-
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.160]   - Yeah, that basically just means
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.720]   that the pawns are in the same way
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   and the major pieces are distributed randomly
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.520]   on the last rank.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.840]   Only that there have to be obviously bishops
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.520]   of opposite color and the king has to be
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.480]   in between the rooks so that you can castle both ways.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.800]   - Oh, you can still castle in chess 960.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.440]   - You can still castle, but it makes it interesting.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.600]   So you still have, it still castles in the same way.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.000]   So let's say the king is like-
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.120]   - Yeah, what happens in that case?
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.600]   - Yeah, let's say the king is in the corner.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.800]   So to castle this side,
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.280]   you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.320]   - What would castling look like though?
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.080]   - No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.360]   - Oh, okay.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.680]   - And that's happened in my games as well.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.720]   Like I forgot about castling
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.920]   and I've been like attacking a king over here
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.560]   and then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   I think Fischer chess is good that it's,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:02.000]   the maps will generally be worse than regular chess.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.320]   Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.600]   for creating a competitive game as possible
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.400]   but they will still be like interesting
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   and diverse enough that you can play
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.480]   very, very interesting games.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.080]   - So when you say maps, there's 960 different options
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.880]   and like what fraction of that creates interesting games
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.120]   at the highest level?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.640]   And this is something that a lot of people are curious about
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.160]   because when you challenge a great chess player
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   like yourself to look at a random starting position,
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:41.240]   that feels like it pushes you to play pure chess
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.280]   versus memorizing lines and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   - For sure, but that's the whole idea.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.120]   - Yeah.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.240]   - That's what you want and--
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.160]   - How hard is it to play?
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.560]   I mean, can you talk about what it feels like to you
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.000]   to play with a random starting position?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.440]   Is there some intuition you've been building up?
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.200]   - It's very, very different.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.000]   And I mean, understandably engines have
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.040]   an even greater advantage in 960
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.400]   than they have in classical chess.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.880]   No, it's super interesting.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   And that's why also I really wish
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.760]   that we played more classical chess,
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.600]   like long games, four to seven hours
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.800]   and in fish random chess, chess 960,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.680]   because then you really need that time.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.640]   Even on the first moves, what usually happens
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.960]   is that you get 15 minutes before the game,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.760]   you're getting told the position 15 minutes before the game
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.520]   and then you can think about it a little bit,
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.200]   even check the computer, but that's all the time you have.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.840]   But then you really need to figure it out.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.880]   And some of the positions obviously
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.360]   are a lot more interesting than the others.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   In some of them, it appears that
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.280]   if you don't play symmetrically at the start,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.840]   then you're probably gonna be in a pretty bad position.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.960]   - What do you mean, with the pawns?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.480]   - With the pawns, yeah.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.320]   - How does that make sense?
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.960]   - That's the thing about chess though.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.160]   So let's say white opens with e4,
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.360]   which has always been the most played move.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.880]   There are many ways to meet that,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.400]   but the most solid ways of playing
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.680]   has always been the symmetrical response with e5.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.080]   And then there's the Ruy Lopez,
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.640]   there's the Petrov opening and so on.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   And if you just ban symmetry on the first move in chess,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.720]   you would get more interesting games.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.040]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.480]   - Or you'd get more decisive games.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.280]   So that's the good thing about chess
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.720]   is that we've played it so long
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.120]   that we've actually devised non-symmetrical openings
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.160]   that are also fairly equal.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.320]   - But symmetry is a good default.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.040]   - But yeah, symmetry is a good default.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.880]   And it's a problem that by playing symmetrical
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.600]   armed with good preparation in regular chess
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.800]   it's just a little bit too easy to,
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.400]   it's a little bit too drawish.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   And I guess if you analyzed a lot in chess 960,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.800]   then a lot of the position would end up
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.680]   being pretty drawish as well.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.960]   - Oh, 'cause the random starting points are so shitty,
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.160]   you're forced to-
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.480]   - You're actually forced to play symmetrically.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.280]   You cannot actually try and play
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.560]   in a more sort of interesting manner.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.280]   - Is there any other kind of variations
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.360]   that are interesting to you?
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.600]   - Oh yeah, there are several.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   So no castling chess has been promoted
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.200]   by former world champion, Vladimir Kramnik.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.040]   There have been a few tournaments with that,
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.280]   not any that I've participated in though.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   I kind of like it.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.640]   Also my coach uses like non-castling engines quite a bit
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.720]   to analyze regular positions
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.240]   just to get a different perspective.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.160]   - So castling is like a defensive thing.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.800]   So if you remove castling,
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.240]   it forces you to be more offensive, is that why?
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   - Yeah, it just, yeah, for sure.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   - It seems like a tiny little difference.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.400]   - No castling probably forces you
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.840]   to be a little bit more defensive at the start,
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.760]   or I would guess so,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.560]   because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.040]   It's gonna make the game a bit slower at the start,
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.040]   but I feel like eventually it's gonna make the games more,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:51.360]   well, less drawish for sure.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.760]   Then you have some weirder variants
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.120]   like where the pawns can move,
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.120]   both diagonally and forward.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.680]   And also you have self-capture chess,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.440]   which is quite interesting.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.880]   So the pawns can, or-
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.440]   - Commit suicide?
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   - Yeah, people can-
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.920]   - Why would that be a good move?
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.640]   - No, sometimes one of your pieces occupy a square.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.880]   I mean, let me just set up a position.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   Let's put it like this, for instance,
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.000]   like here, I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.560]   for white, like this, for instance,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.680]   or there are several ways,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.640]   but like this would be a checkmate.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.200]   - Oh, cool.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.440]   For people who are just listening,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.760]   yeah, basically you're bringing in a knight
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.120]   close to the king, the queen, and so on,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.920]   and you replace the knight with a queen.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.840]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   So you can have like a front of pieces
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.280]   and then you just replace them with the second piece.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.560]   - Yeah, I mean, that could be interesting.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.960]   I think also maybe sometimes it's just clearance, basically.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.840]   It adds an extra element of clearance.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.600]   So I think there are many, many different variants.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.360]   I don't think any of them are better
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.760]   than the one that has been played
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.040]   for at least a thousand years,
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   but it's certainly interesting to see.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.960]   - So one of your goals is to reach
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.840]   the FIDE ELO chess rating of 2,900.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.320]   Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.520]   and what does it take to get there?
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.120]   Is it possible for a human being to get there?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.760]   - Basically you play with a factor of 10,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.280]   which means that if I were to play against
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.200]   an opponent who's rated the same as me,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.520]   I would be expected to score 50%, obviously,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.320]   and that means that I would win five points with a win,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.720]   lose five points with a draw, and then equal if I draw.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   If your opponent is 200 points lower rated,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.640]   you're expected to score 75% and so on.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.000]   - And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and then it slowly converges towards an estimate
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.160]   of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.560]   - Yeah, and my rating is obviously carried
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.600]   through thousands of games.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Right now my rating is 2,861, which is decent.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.840]   I think that pretty much corresponds
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.560]   to the level I have at the moment,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.200]   which means in order to reach 2,900,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.960]   I would have to either get better at chess,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   which I think is fairly hard to do,
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.120]   at least considerably better.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   So what I would need to do is try and optimize even more
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.800]   in terms of-- - The matchups,
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.240]   the game you play. - Preparations, everything.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.640]   But not necessarily selecting tournaments and so on,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.280]   but just optimizing in terms of preparation,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.840]   like making sure I never have any bad days.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.560]   - So you basically can't lose.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.040]   - Yeah, I basically can't fuck up ever
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.480]   if I wanna reach that goal.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   And so I think reaching 2,900 is pretty unlikely.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.320]   The reason I've set the goal is to have something
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:31.080]   to play for, to have a motivation
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.960]   to actually try and be at my best when I play,
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.560]   because otherwise I'm playing to some extent
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.480]   mostly for fun these days in that I love to play,
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   I love to try and win, but I don't have a lot to prove
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.120]   or anything, but that gives me at least the motivation
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.000]   to try and be at my best all the time,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.240]   which I think is something to aim for.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.800]   So at the moment, I'm quite enjoying that process
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   of trying to optimize.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.600]   - What would you say motivates you in this now
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.000]   and in the years leading up to now,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.120]   the love of winning or the fear of losing?
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.880]   - So for the World Championship,
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.400]   it's been fear of losing for sure.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.880]   And that's why I also get more joy
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.400]   from winning most tournaments than I do
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.280]   for winning the World Championship,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.640]   because then it's mostly been a relief.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.600]   I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.920]   because I feel like I'm a little bit more relaxed now.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.160]   And I also know that it's not gonna last forever.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.680]   And yeah, in terms of fear of losing,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.720]   that's a huge reason why I'm not gonna play
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.640]   the World Championship,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   because it really didn't give me a lot of joy.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.320]   It really was all about avoiding losing.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.320]   - Why is it that the World Championship
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.000]   really makes you feel this way?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.280]   The anxiety.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.240]   So, and when you say losing, do you mean not just the match,
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.240]   but every single position, the fear of a blunder?
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.160]   - No, I mean, the blunder is okay.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   Like when I sit down at the board,
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.600]   then it's mostly been fine,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.760]   because then I'm focused on the game.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.680]   And then I know that I can play the game.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.600]   It's a time like in between, like knowing that,
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.280]   I feel like losing is not an option
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.840]   because it's the World Championship.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.480]   And because in a World Championship, there are two players.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.280]   There's a winner and a loser.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.920]   If I don't win a random tournament that I play,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.840]   then I'm usually, it depends on the tournament.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.480]   I might be disappointed for sure,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.920]   might even be pretty pissed,
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   but ultimately, you go on to the next one.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.000]   With the World Championship,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.080]   you don't go on to the next one.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.560]   It's like, it's years.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.400]   - Yeah.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.040]   - And it also has been like,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.440]   it's been a core part of my identity for a while now
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.600]   that I am World Champion.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   And so there's not an option of losing that.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   - Yeah.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.520]   Yeah, you're gonna have to,
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.160]   at least for a couple of years,
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.600]   carry the weight of having lost.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.520]   You're the former World Champion now,
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.160]   if you lose versus the current World Champion.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   There are certain sports that create that anxiety
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.520]   and others that don't.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.800]   For example, I think UFC makes martial arts
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.760]   are a little better with losing.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.560]   It's understood, like everybody loses.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.960]   - Not everybody though.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.640]   - Not everybody, not everybody, not everybody.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.880]   (laughing)
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.240]   Kabib entered the chat.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.600]   But in boxing, there is like that extra pressure
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.680]   of like maintaining the championship.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.080]   I mean, maybe you could say the same thing
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.360]   about the UFC as well.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.200]   So for you personally, for a person who loves chess,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.920]   the first time you won the World Championship,
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.120]   that was the thing that was fun.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.960]   - Yeah.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.120]   - And then everything after is like stressful.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.680]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.720]   Essentially.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.240]   There was certainly stress involved the first time as well,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:44.440]   but it was nothing compared to the others.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.880]   So the only World Championship after that
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.600]   that I really enjoyed was the one in 2018
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.760]   against the American Fabiano Caruana.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.840]   And what made that different is that I'd been kind of
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.720]   slumping for a bit and he'd been on the rise.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.680]   So our ratings were very, very similar.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.520]   They were so close that if at any point during the match,
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.640]   I'd lost the game,
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.360]   he would have been ranked as number one in the world.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.080]   Like our ratings were so close that for each draw,
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:15.920]   they didn't move.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.760]   - And the game itself was close.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.640]   - Yeah, the games themselves were very close.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.600]   I had a winning position in the first game
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.840]   that I couldn't really get anywhere for a lot of games.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.760]   Then he had a couple of games where
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.080]   he could potentially have won.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.000]   Then in the last game, I was a little bit better.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   And eventually they were all drawn.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.920]   But I felt like all the way that this is an interesting
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.600]   match against an opponent who is at this position,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.680]   at this point equal to me.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.600]   And so losing that would not have been a disaster
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.400]   because in all the other matches,
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.200]   I would know that I would have lost against somebody
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.240]   who I know I'm much better than.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   And that would be a lot harder for me to take.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.000]   - Well, that's fascinating and beautiful
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.280]   that the stress isn't from losing,
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.400]   because you have fun.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.200]   You enjoy playing against somebody who's as good as you,
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.720]   maybe better than you.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.160]   That's exciting to you.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.000]   - Yeah.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.360]   - It's losing at this high stakes thing
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   that only happens rarely to a person
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.600]   who's not as good as you.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.720]   - Yeah, and that's why it's also been incredibly frustrating
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.440]   in other matches, like when I know,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.840]   when we play draw after draw,
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.520]   and I can just, I know that I'm better.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.400]   I can sense during the game that I understand
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   it better than them, but I cannot, you know,
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.200]   I cannot get over the hump.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.120]   - So you are the best chess player in the world
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.600]   and you not playing the world championship
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.120]   really makes the world championship not seem important.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.400]   Or, I mean, there's an argument to be made for that.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.720]   Is there anything you would like to see
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.480]   for you to change about the world championship
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.080]   that would make it more fun for you
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.200]   and better for the game of chess period
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.640]   for everybody involved?
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.400]   - So I think 12 games or now 14 games
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.120]   that there is for the world championship
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.160]   is a fairly low sample size.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.120]   If you want to determine who the best player is,
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.480]   or at least the best player in that particular matchup,
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.760]   you need more games.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.000]   And I think to some extent,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.080]   if you're gonna have a world champion
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.000]   and call them the best players,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.680]   best player, you gotta make sure that the format
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.920]   increases the chance of finding the best player.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.960]   So I think having more games,
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.880]   and if you're gonna have a lot more games,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.240]   then you need to decrease the time control a bit,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.120]   which in turn, I think is also a good thing
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   because in very long time controls with deep preparation,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.000]   you can sort of mask a lot of your deficiencies
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.760]   as a chess player,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.680]   because you have a lot of time to think and to defend
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.440]   and also, yeah, you have deep preparation.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.960]   So I think those would be, for me to play,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:22.000]   those would be the main things,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.760]   more games and less time.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.720]   - So you wanna see more games
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.200]   and rules that emphasize pure chess?
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   - Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:40.480]   because defensive techniques are much harder
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.360]   to execute with a little time.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.200]   - What do you think?
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.080]   Is there a sweet spot in terms of,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.240]   are we talking about Blitz?
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.080]   Is it how many minutes?
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.640]   - I think Blitz is a bit too fast.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.960]   To their credit, this was suggested by Fida as well.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.280]   For a start to have two games per day,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   and let's say you have 45 minutes a game
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.360]   plus 15 or 30 seconds per move,
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.480]   that means that each sessions will probably be about,
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.160]   or a little less than two hours.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.920]   That would be a start.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   Also what we're playing in the tournament
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.520]   that I'm playing here in Miami,
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.360]   which is four games a day with 15 minutes
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.400]   plus 10 seconds per move,
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   those would be more interesting than the one there is now.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.760]   And I understand that there are a lot of traditions.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.080]   People don't wanna change the World Championship.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.280]   That's all fine.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.360]   I just think that the World Championship
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.240]   should do a better job of trying to reflect
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.040]   who's the best overall chess player.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.200]   - So would you say like, if it's faster games,
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.080]   you'd probably be able to get a sample size
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.360]   of like over 20 games, 20, 30, 40.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.840]   You think there's a number that's good
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.400]   over a long period of time?
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.280]   - Well, I would prefer as many as possible.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   - So like a hundred?
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:07.400]   - Yeah, but let's say you play 12 days, two games a day.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.120]   You know, that's 24.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.480]   I feel like that's already quite a bit better.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.920]   You play like one black game, one white game each day.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.360]   - Endurance wise, that's okay?
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.200]   - Yeah, I think that's fine.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.680]   Like you will have free days as well.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.320]   So I don't think that will be a problem.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   And also you have to prepare two sets of openings
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.120]   for each day, which makes it more difficult
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.560]   for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.480]   - Let me ask you a fun question.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   If Hikaru and Nakamura was one of the two people,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   I guess, I apologize.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.760]   - Yeah, he could have finished second.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   So he lost the last round of the candidates.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.440]   - Yeah, and you, maybe you can explain to me
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.920]   internet speak, Copium is something you tweeted.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.960]   - Yeah.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:58.080]   - But if he got second, would you,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.160]   just despite him still play the world championship?
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.640]   That's internet question.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.000]   And when the internet asks, I must abide.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.480]   I do abide.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.640]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   Thank you, internet.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:15.080]   So after the last match, I did an interview
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:20.160]   right after where I talked about the fact
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.400]   that I was unlikely to play the next one.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.720]   I'd spoken privately to both family, friends,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.120]   and of course also my chess team
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.880]   that this was likely going to be the last match.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.160]   What happened was that right before
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.320]   the world championship match,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.280]   there was this young player, Alvarez Afiruza.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.560]   He had a dramatic rise.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.120]   He rose to second in the world rankings.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.920]   He was 18 then, he's 19 now.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   He qualified for the candidates.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.720]   And they felt like there was like
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.360]   at least a half realistic possibility
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.280]   that he could be the challenger
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.480]   for the next world championship.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.680]   And that sort of lit a fire under me.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.440]   - Do you like that idea?
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.360]   - I like that a lot.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.560]   I love the idea of playing him
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.720]   in the next world championship.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:16.600]   And originally I was sure that I wanted to announce
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.000]   right after the tournament, the match,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.680]   that this was it, I'm done.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.560]   I'm not playing the next one.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.120]   But this lit a fire under me.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.400]   So that made me think, you know,
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.720]   this actually motivates me.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.120]   And I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.680]   To create more hype about the candidates.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.240]   To like sort of motivate myself a little bit,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.320]   maybe motivate him.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.800]   Also, obviously I wanted to give people a heads up
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.560]   for the candidates that you might be playing
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.160]   for more than first place.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.280]   Like normally the candidates is first place or best.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.920]   It's like the world championship.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.360]   And then, so Nakamura was one of many people
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.200]   who just didn't believe me.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.520]   Which is fair.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.120]   'Cause I've talked before about not necessarily wanting
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.920]   to defend again.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.040]   But I never like talked as concretely
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.840]   or was as serious as this time.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.960]   So he simply didn't believe me.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.280]   And he was very vocal about that.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.800]   And he said, nobody believed me.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.160]   No other players, which may or may not have been true.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.720]   And then yeah, he lost the last game and he didn't qualify.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.640]   But to answer the question,
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.080]   no, I'd already at that point decided
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.200]   that I wouldn't play.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.240]   - But the decision was made.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.560]   - But the decision was already made.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.240]   - Does it break your heart a little bit
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:54.520]   that you're walking away from it?
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.280]   In all the ways that you mentioned that it's just not fun.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.720]   There's a bunch of ways that it doesn't seem
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.040]   to bring out the best kind of chess.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.920]   It doesn't bring out the best out of you
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.720]   and the particular opponents involved.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.400]   Does it just break your heart a little bit?
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.920]   Like you're walking away from something
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.240]   or maybe the entire chess community is walking away
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.120]   from a kind of a historic event that was so important
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.800]   in the 20th century at least.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.800]   - So I won the championship in 2013.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.480]   I said no to the candidates in 2011.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.720]   I didn't particularly like the format.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.000]   I also wasn't, I was just not in the mood.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   I didn't want the pressure that was connected
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.120]   with the world championship.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.000]   And I was perfectly content at the time
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.240]   to play the tournaments that I did play.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.840]   Also to be ranked number one in the world,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.240]   I was comfortable with the fact
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.920]   that I knew that I was the best
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.960]   and I didn't need a title to show others.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.040]   And what happened later is I suddenly decided to play.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.200]   In 2013, I liked, they changed the format.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.560]   I liked it better.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.120]   I just decided, you know, it could be interesting.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.320]   Let's try and get this.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.280]   There really wasn't more than that to it.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.800]   It wasn't like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.160]   I just thought, you know, let's play.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.120]   - So it's just a cool tournament, a good challenge?
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.240]   - Yeah, it's a cool tournament.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.360]   It's a good challenge.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.200]   You know, why not?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.000]   It's something that could be a motivation.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.120]   It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.480]   that I had been till then.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.320]   So it was a good thing.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.520]   And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.360]   So I'm very, very happy that I did that.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.560]   But I never had any thoughts that I'm gonna
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.240]   like keep the title for a long time.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.920]   Immediately after the match in 2013,
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.760]   I mean, also before the match,
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.480]   I'd spoken against the fact that champion is seeded
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.840]   into the final, which I thought was unfair.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.520]   After the match, I made a proposal
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.120]   that we have a different system
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.800]   where the champion doesn't have these privileges
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.960]   and people's reaction, both players and chess community
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.040]   was generally like, okay, we're good.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.920]   We don't want that.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.080]   You keep your privileges.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.880]   I was like, okay, whatever.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.080]   - So you wanna fight for it every time?
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.960]   - Yeah, I want that.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:37.280]   - Have to ask, just in case you have an opinion,
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.000]   if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.520]   analyze Ding versus Nepo, who wins?
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.960]   The current, the two people that would play
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.480]   if you're not playing.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.520]   - Generally, I would consider that Ding
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.160]   has a slightly better overall chess strength.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.320]   - What are the strengths and weaknesses of each
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.440]   if you can kind of summarize it?
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   - So Nepo, he's even better at calculating short lines
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.880]   than I am.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.440]   But he can sometimes lack a little bit of depth.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.120]   Like he's in short lines,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.680]   he's an absolute calculation monster.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   He's extremely quick,
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.880]   but he can sometimes lack a bit of depth.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.480]   Also recently, he's improved his openings quite a bit.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.240]   So now he has a lot of good ideas
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.600]   and he's very, very solid.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.480]   Ding is not quite as well prepared,
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.120]   but he has an excellent understanding of dynamics
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.680]   and imbalances in chess, I would say.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.200]   - What do you mean by imbalances?
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.120]   - Imbalances like bishops against knights
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.600]   and material imbalances.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.320]   - He can take advantage of those.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.240]   - Yes, I would say he's very, very good at that
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.120]   and understanding the dynamic factors,
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   as we call them, like material versus time, especially.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.720]   - I think Nepo got the better of him and the candidates.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.200]   So what's your sense why Ding has an edge
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.880]   in the championship?
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.720]   - I feel like individual past results
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.400]   hasn't necessarily been a great indicator
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.800]   of world championship results.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   I feel like overall chess strength is more important.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.360]   I mean, to be fair,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.320]   I only think like Ding has a very small edge.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.520]   Like difference is not big at all,
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.800]   but our individual head-to-head record
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.880]   was probably the main reason that a lot of people thought
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.440]   Nepo had a good chance against me as well.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   It was like four to one in his favor before the match,
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.120]   but that was just another example
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.400]   of why that may not necessarily mean anything.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.920]   Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   I think about the size of the match in total 14 games.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.200]   And that generally doesn't mean much.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.120]   - How close were those games, would you say,
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.960]   in your mind for the previous championship?
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.400]   So that game six was a turning point where you won.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.920]   Was there any doubt in your mind that,
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.640]   like if you do a much larger sample size,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.440]   you'll get the better of Nepo?
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.520]   - No, no, larger sample size is always good for me.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   So world championship, it's a great parallel to football
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.360]   because it's a low scoring game.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   And if the better player or the better team scores,
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.200]   they win most of the time.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.280]   - Oh, that's generally for championships or in general?
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.720]   - Yeah, for championships.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.440]   Like they generally win because the other
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.160]   slightly weaker team, they're good enough to defend,
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.920]   to make it very, very difficult for the others.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.840]   But when they actually have to create the chances,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.120]   then they have no chance.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.680]   And then it very often ends with a blowout
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.000]   as it did in our match.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.680]   If I hadn't won game six,
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.080]   it probably would have been very, very close.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.840]   He might've edged it.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.240]   There's obviously a bigger chance
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.320]   that I would have edged it.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.280]   But this is just what happens a lot in chess,
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.160]   but also in football, that matches are close and then they-
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.000]   - Somebody scores.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.960]   - Somebody scores and then things change.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.720]   And this gives people the illusion
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.120]   that the matchup was very close.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.000]   Which, while actually it just means
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.920]   that the nature of the game makes the matches close
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.280]   very often, but it's always much more likely
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.080]   that one of the teams is gonna,
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.560]   or one of the players is gonna break away than the others.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.480]   And in other matches as well,
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.680]   even though a lot of people, before the match in 2016
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.600]   against Karjakin, there were people
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.720]   who thought before the match that I was massively overrated
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.720]   as a favorite and that essentially the match
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.760]   was pretty close, like whatever, 60-40,
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.000]   or some people even say like 55-45.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.560]   And what I felt was that the match went very,
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.640]   very wrong for me and I still won.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.200]   And some people saw that as an indication
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.880]   that the pre-match probabilities were probably a bit closer
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   than people thought.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.760]   Well, I would look at it in the way
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.680]   that everything went wrong and I still won,
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.440]   which probably means that I was a pretty big favorite
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.280]   to begin with.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.760]   - I do have a question to you about that match,
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.920]   but first, so Sergey Karjakin was originally a qualifier
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.200]   for the candidate tournament, but was disqualified
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.400]   for breaching the FIDEA code of ethics
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.160]   after publicly expressing approval
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.880]   for the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.400]   You look at the Cold War and some of the US
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.480]   versus Russian games of the past,
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.880]   does politics, some of this geopolitics,
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.360]   politics ever creep its way into the game?
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.560]   Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that,
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.600]   as it does sometimes for the Olympics,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.640]   these big nations playing each other,
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.120]   competing against each other,
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:22.120]   almost like fighting out in a friendly way,
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.880]   the battles, the tensions that they have
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.080]   in the space of geopolitics?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.640]   - I think it still does.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.920]   So the president of the World Chess Federation,
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   who was just reelected, is a Russian.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.840]   Like, I like him personally, for sure,
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.640]   but he is quite connected to the Kremlin,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.160]   and it's quite clear that the Kremlin considers it
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.640]   at least a semi-important goal
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.320]   to bring the chess crown home to Russia.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.920]   So it's still definitely a factor.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.720]   And I mean, I can answer for in the Karjakin case,
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.120]   like, I don't have a strong opinion
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.920]   on whether he should have been banned or not.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.480]   Obviously, I don't agree with anything that he says,
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.480]   but in principle, I think that you should ban
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.000]   either no Russians or all Russians.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   I'm generally not particularly against either,
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.480]   but I don't love banning wrong opinions,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   even if they are as reprehensible as his have been.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.440]   - Yeah, there's something about the World Chess Championships
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.440]   or the Olympics where it feels like banning
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.520]   is counterproductive to the alleviating
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.040]   some of the conflicts.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:43.880]   - We don't know.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.240]   This is the thing, though.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.920]   We really don't know about the long-term conflicts.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.280]   And a lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense,
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.800]   which I don't really blame at all.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.760]   It's just that we don't know.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.880]   And I guess sometimes there are other ways
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.120]   you want to try and help as well.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.920]   - See, like within the competition,
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.480]   within some of those battles of US versus Russia
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.120]   or so on of the past,
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.760]   there's also between the individuals,
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.360]   maybe you'll disagree with this,
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.920]   but from a spectator perspective,
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.840]   there's still a camaraderie.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.800]   Like at the end of the day,
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.360]   there's a thing that unites you,
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.320]   which is this like appreciation
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   of the fight over the chessboard.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.280]   Even if you hate each other in a moment.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.120]   - For sure.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.840]   I think for every match that's been,
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.640]   you would briefly discuss the game with your opponent
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.800]   after the game, no matter how much you hate each other.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.920]   And I think that's lovely.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.800]   And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.640]   like when somebody in his team asked him,
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.240]   like, why are you talking to Karpov after the game?
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.280]   Like, you hate that guy.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   And he's like, yeah, sure.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.560]   But he's the only one who understands me.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.280]   - Yeah, the only one who understands.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.640]   - So that's, no, I think that's really lovely.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.200]   And I would love to see that in other areas as well,
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.280]   that you can, regardless of what happens,
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.040]   you can have a good chat about the game.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   You can just talk about the ideas
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.760]   with people who understand what you understand.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.680]   - So if you're not playing the world championships,
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.360]   there's a lot of people who are saying
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.680]   that perhaps the world championships don't matter anymore.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.120]   Do you think there's some truth to that?
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.520]   - I said that back a long time ago as well,
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.520]   that for me, I don't know if it never happened.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.360]   So I don't know what would have happened,
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.960]   but I was thinking like the moment that I realized
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.480]   that I'm not the best player in the world,
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.400]   like I felt like morally I have to renounce
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.680]   the world championship title, you know?
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.440]   Because it doesn't mean anything
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.560]   as long as you're not the best player.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.560]   - So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.360]   - I think so, at least over time.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.080]   Like I'm a lot more proud of my streak
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.800]   of being rated number one in the world,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   which is now since I think the summer of 2011.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   I'm a lot more proud of that than the world championships.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.520]   - How much anxiety or even fear do you have
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.440]   before making a difficult decision on the chess board?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.840]   So when it's a high stakes game, how nervous do you get?
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.000]   How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.640]   You're sitting there for 10, 15 minutes
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.080]   'cause you're in a fog.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.080]   There's always a possibility of a blunder, of a mistake.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.280]   Are you anxious about it?
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.880]   Are you afraid of it?
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.900]   - Really depends.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.860]   I have been at times.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.500]   I think the most nervous I've ever been was game 10
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.460]   of the world championships in 2018.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.460]   I know that was just a thrilling game.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.020]   I was black.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.820]   I basically abandoned the queen side at some point
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.460]   to attack him on the king side.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.940]   And I knew that my attack,
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.140]   if it doesn't work, I'm gonna lose.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.100]   But I had so much adrenaline.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.380]   So that was fine.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.940]   I thought I was gonna win.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.140]   Then at some point I realized that it's not so clear.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.980]   And my time was ticking and I was just getting so nervous.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:25.940]   I still remember what happened.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.140]   We played this time trouble phase
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.500]   where he had very little time, but I had even less.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.100]   And I just remember, I cannot remember much of it,
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.380]   just that when it was over, I was just so relieved
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.140]   because then it was clear that the position
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.500]   was probably gonna be routed in a draw.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:47.340]   Otherwise, I'm often nervous before games,
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.700]   but when I get there, it's all business.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.780]   And especially when I'm playing well,
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.900]   I'm never afraid of losing when I play
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.100]   because I trust my instincts.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.500]   I trust my skills.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.100]   - How much psychological intimidation is there
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.500]   from you to the other person,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.980]   from the other person to you?
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.860]   - I think people would play a lot better
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.060]   if they played against an anonymous me.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.420]   I would love to-
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.980]   - Or people are scared of you.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.380]   - I would love to have a tournament online
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.460]   where let's say you play 10 of the best players in the world
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.700]   and for each round, you don't know who you're playing.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.860]   - That's an interesting question.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.980]   There's these videos where people eat McDonald's
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.580]   or Burger King or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.140]   Would people be able to tell they're playing you
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:45.060]   from the style of play, do you think?
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.620]   Or from the strength of play?
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:51.260]   - If there was a decent sample size, sure.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.100]   - And what about you?
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.900]   Would you be able to tell others?
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.140]   - In just one game?
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.460]   Very unlikely.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.220]   - What sample size would you need to tell accurately?
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.620]   I feel like it's a science.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.700]   - Yeah, I think 20 games would help a lot.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.540]   - Per person?
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.140]   - Yeah.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.580]   But I know that they've already developed AI bots
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.980]   that are pretty good at recognizing somebody's style.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.820]   - Okay.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.300]   - Which is quite fascinating.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.700]   - And it'd be fascinating if those bots
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.980]   were able to summarize the style somehow.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.420]   Maybe great attacking chess,
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.580]   like some of the same characteristics you've been describing,
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.580]   like great at short line calculations,
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:34.780]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.860]   Or just talk shit.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.580]   - No, but really all the best chess players,
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.180]   there are basically just two camps.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.260]   People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.260]   it's the hare and the tortoise, basically.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:54.260]   And sometimes, I feel like I'm the closest you can get
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.820]   to a hybrid of those.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.140]   - Because you're good in every position,
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.620]   so the middle game and the end game.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.580]   - Yeah, and also I can think to some extent
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.980]   both rapidly and deeply,
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.900]   which a lot of people, they can't do both.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.260]   But I mean, to answer your question from before,
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.060]   I think, yeah, I sometimes can get
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.900]   a little bit intimidated by my opponent,
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.500]   but it's mostly if there's something unknown.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.340]   It's mostly if it's something that I don't understand fully.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.180]   And I do think, especially when I'm playing well,
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.620]   people, they just play more timidly against me
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.020]   than they do against each other,
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.580]   sometimes without even realizing it.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.860]   And I certainly use that to my advantage.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.300]   If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive,
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.700]   if I sense that they're not gonna necessarily
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.340]   take all their chances,
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.380]   it just means that I can take more risk.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.380]   And I always try and find that balance.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.700]   - To shake 'em up a little bit.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.540]   - Yeah.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.220]   - What's been the toughest loss of your career
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:04.340]   that you remember?
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.220]   Would that be the World Championship match?
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.580]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.420]   - Can you take--
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.380]   - Game eight in 2016.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.420]   - And who was it against?
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.500]   - Against Kariakin in New York.
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.340]   - Can you take it through the story of that game?
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:22.300]   Where were you before that game
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.460]   in terms of game one through seven?
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.140]   - Yeah, so game one and two, not much happened.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:32.740]   Game three and four, I was winning in both of them.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:37.740]   And normally I should definitely have converted both.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.900]   I couldn't, partly due to good defense on his part,
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:47.660]   but mostly because I just, I messed up.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.460]   And then after that, games five, six and seven,
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.380]   not much happened.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:00.260]   I was getting impatient at that point.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:04.540]   So for game eight, I was probably ready
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.060]   to take a little bit more risks than I had before,
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.540]   which I guess was insane,
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.660]   because I knew that he wouldn't beat me
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.940]   unless I beat myself.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.500]   Like he wasn't strong enough to outplay me.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.580]   - And that was leading to impatience somehow,
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.740]   an impatience--
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.140]   - No, because I knew that I was better.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.180]   I knew that I was better.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.060]   I knew that I just needed to win one game
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.540]   and then the match is over.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.900]   That's what happened in 2021 as well.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.860]   Like when I won the first game against Netball,
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.020]   I knew that the match was over.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:38.340]   Unless I like fuck up royally,
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:42.420]   then he's not gonna be able to beat me.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.100]   So what happened was that I played
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.340]   a kind of innocuous opening as Wyatt,
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.620]   just trying to get a game,
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.100]   trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:52.940]   Then--
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.860]   - Can you elaborate innocuous, get him out of the book?
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.220]   - No, but basically I set up pretty defensively as Wyatt.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:04.540]   I wasn't really crossing into his half at the start at all.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.380]   I was just, I played more like a system
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.100]   more than like a concrete opening.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.700]   It was like, I'm gonna set up my pieces this way.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.060]   You can set them up however you want.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:18.460]   And then later we're sort of, the armies are gonna meet.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.780]   I'm not gonna try and bother you at the start.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.740]   - And that means you're gonna have
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.220]   with as many pieces as possible
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.380]   kind of pure chess in the middle game
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.180]   without any of the lines,
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.300]   the extended lines in the opening.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.380]   - Exactly.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.940]   And so there was at some point a couple of exchanges,
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.380]   then some maneuvering, flip a little bit better.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.260]   Then he was sort of equalizing
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.540]   and then I started to take too many risks
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.700]   and I was still sort of fine,
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.700]   but then at some point I realized
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.900]   that I'd gone a bit too far
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.500]   and I had to be really careful.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.220]   - Then I just froze.
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.380]   - I just completely froze.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.180]   - Mentally?
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.020]   - Yeah, mentally.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:16:59.980]   - What happened?
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.900]   - I realized that, I mean, all the thoughts of,
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.540]   I might lose this.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.380]   What have I done?
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.860]   Why did I take so many risks?
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.060]   I knew that I could have drawn at any moment.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.580]   Just be patient.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.620]   Don't give him these opportunities.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.900]   - What triggered that face transition in your mind?
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.740]   - No, it was just--
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.580]   - The one thing or--
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.460]   - No, it was just a position on the board,
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.220]   like realizing there was one particular move he played
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:29.020]   that I missed and then I realized
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.380]   this could potentially not go my way.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.420]   So then I made another couple of mistakes
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.620]   and he, to his credit,
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.580]   once he realized he had the chance,
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.180]   he was like, he knew that this was his one chance.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.980]   He had to take it.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.700]   And so he did.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:51.260]   And yeah, that's the worst I've ever felt
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.980]   after a chess game.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.620]   I realized that I'm probably gonna lose my title
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.820]   against somebody who's not even close to my level.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:07.020]   And I've done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.700]   And that was really, really...
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.140]   At the time, I was all in my own head.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.460]   That was hard to deal with.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.380]   And I felt like I didn't really recover too much
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.420]   for the next game.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:27.140]   So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:30.060]   So I did something that I never did
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.620]   at any other world championship.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.740]   After game eight, I just...
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.980]   I got drunk with my team.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.820]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:39.660]   - And-- - That's not
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:40.700]   a standard procedure?
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.900]   - No, no.
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.820]   That's the only time that's happened
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.340]   in a world championship during the match.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:49.980]   So yeah, I just tried to forget.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.180]   But still, before game nine,
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:54.380]   game nine, I was a little bit more relaxed,
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.620]   but I was still a bit nervous.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:59.700]   Then game nine, I was almost lost as well.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.020]   Then only game 10.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.460]   Game 10, I was still, I wasn't in a great mood.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.060]   I was really, really tense.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.060]   The opening was good.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.740]   I had some advantage.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.940]   I was getting optimistic.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.860]   Then I made one mistake.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.300]   He could have forced a draw.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.060]   And then all the negativity came back.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.420]   I was thinking during the game,
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.900]   how am I gonna play for a win with Black in the next game?
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.420]   What am I doing?
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.740]   And then, eventually, it ended well.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:32.900]   I didn't find the right line.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.900]   I ground him down.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.860]   Actually, I played, at some point,
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.300]   pretty well in the end game.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:43.220]   And after that game, there was such a weight lifted.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.700]   After that, there was no thought
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.340]   of losing the match whatsoever.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:53.980]   I knew that, okay, I'd basically gotten away with,
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:59.180]   not with murder, but gotten away with something.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.940]   - What can you say about after game eight?
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.740]   Where are the places you've gone in your mind?
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.460]   Do you go to some dark places?
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.140]   We're talking about depression.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:11.260]   Do you think about quitting at that point?
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.700]   - No, I think about quitting
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.100]   every time I lose a classical game.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.260]   Or at least I used to.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:21.340]   Especially if it's in a stupid way.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.180]   I'm thinking, okay, if I'm gonna play like this,
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.900]   if I'm gonna do things that I know are wrong,
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.140]   then I might as well quit.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:34.060]   No, that's happened a bunch of times.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.420]   And I've definitely gotten a bit more carefree
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.860]   about losing these days,
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.380]   which is not necessarily a good thing.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:46.380]   My hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:49.380]   And it also lit the fire under me
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.540]   that I think my performance after losses
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.020]   in classical chess over the last 10 years
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.460]   is over 2,900.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.420]   I really play well after a loss,
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:03.580]   even though it's really, really unpleasant.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:08.860]   So apparently, I don't think the way that I dealt with them
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.620]   is particularly healthy, but it's worked.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:12.820]   - It's worked so far.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.780]   But then you've discovered now a love for winning
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:20.420]   to where ultimately, longevity-wise, creates more fun.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.260]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:26.220]   - What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.700]   on a day of a big chess match?
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.380]   It doesn't have to be World Championship,
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:33.780]   but if it's a chess match you care about,
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.900]   what time do you wake up?
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.300]   What do you eat?
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.980]   - Oh, it depends on when the game is.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:42.660]   But let's say the game is at three.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:47.660]   I'll probably wake up pretty late at about 11.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:54.500]   Then I'll go for a walk,
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.620]   might listen to some podcasts.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:00.180]   Maybe I'll spend a little bit of time
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:04.180]   looking at some NBA game from last night or whatever.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.500]   - So not chess-related stuff?
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.900]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:11.460]   Then I'll get back, I'll have a big lunch,
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.420]   usually a big omelet with a bunch of salad and stuff.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:20.420]   Then go to the game, win a very nice, clean game.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.220]   - This is a perfect day.
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:24.540]   - Just go back after, relax.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.780]   The things that make me the happiest at tournaments
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:33.580]   is just having a good routine and feeling well.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:36.860]   I don't like it when too much is happening around me.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.820]   So the tournament that I came from now
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:44.020]   was the Chess Olympiad, which is the team event.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:46.300]   So we were team Norway.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.620]   We did horribly.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.220]   I did okay, but the team in general did horribly.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.340]   - Who won that, Italy?
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.340]   - No, no, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won in the end.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.020]   They were this amazing team of young players.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.900]   It was really impressive.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.540]   But the thing is, we had a good camaraderie in the team.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.300]   We had our meals together.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.180]   We played a bit of football, went swimming.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.300]   And I couldn't understand why things went wrong.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.380]   And I still don't understand.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.180]   But the thing is, for me, it was all very nice.
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.820]   But now I'm so happy to be on my own at a tournament
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:24.100]   just to have my own routines, not see too many people.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.220]   Otherwise, just have a very small team of people that I see.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.940]   - You are a kind of celebrity now.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.580]   So people within the chess tournament and outside
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.620]   recognize you, want to socialize,
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.540]   want to tell you about how much you mean to them,
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.780]   how much you inspire them, all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:43.900]   Does that get in the way for you
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.820]   when you're trying to really focus on the match?
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:49.420]   Are you able to block that?
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.900]   Are you able to enjoy those little interactions
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.380]   and still keep your focus?
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.060]   - Yeah, most of the time that's fine
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.620]   as long as it's not too much.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.020]   But I have to admit, when I'm at home in Norway,
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:06.940]   I rarely go out without big headphones and something.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:11.900]   - Oh, like a disguise?
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.380]   - No, not a disguise, just to block out the world.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.500]   Otherwise...
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.660]   - Don't make eye contact.
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:23.300]   - Yeah, no, so the thing is, people in general are nice.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.900]   I mean, people, they wish me well.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.380]   And they don't bother me.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.620]   Also, when I have the headphones on,
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.380]   I don't notice as much people turning around and all of that
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.660]   so I can be more in my own world.
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:40.780]   So I like that.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:45.740]   - Yeah, what about in this perfect day after the game,
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.460]   do you try to analyze what happened?
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.740]   Do you try to think through systematically
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.140]   or do you just kind of loosely think about like...
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.620]   - No, I just loosely think about it.
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.820]   I've never been very structured in that sense.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.180]   I know that it was always recommended
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.980]   that you analyze your own games,
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.860]   but I generally felt that I mostly had a good idea
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.700]   about that.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:12.700]   Like nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.340]   at a certain point if I'm curious about that.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:18.580]   Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.260]   - What about diet?
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.100]   You said omelet and salad and so on.
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.940]   I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus,
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.980]   Magnus number two, you had like this bet about meat.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   One of you are gonna go vegan if you lose.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.820]   I forget which bet.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.140]   - Vegetarian though.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.500]   - Vegetarian, sorry.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.260]   And you both have an admiration for meat.
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:45.700]   Is there some aspect about optimal performance
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.860]   that you look for in food?
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:50.780]   Like maybe eating only like once or twice a day
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.380]   or a particular kind of food?
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.060]   Like meat heavy diet.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.140]   Is there anything like that?
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.460]   Or you just try to have fun with the food?
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:01.060]   - I think whenever I'm at tournaments,
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.740]   like it's very natural to eat,
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.140]   at least for me to eat only twice a day.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.820]   So usually I do that when I'm at home as well.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.980]   - So you do eat before the tournament though?
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.900]   You don't play fasted?
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:13.740]   - No, no, no.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:18.820]   But I try not to eat too heavy before the game
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.500]   or in general to avoid sugary stuff,
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:26.740]   to have a pretty stable blood sugar level.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:29.060]   'Cause that's the easiest way to make mistake
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:33.540]   that your energy levels just suddenly drop.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.060]   And they don't necessarily need to be too high
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.300]   as long as they're pretty stable, yeah.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.340]   - Have you ever tried playing fasted?
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:44.580]   Like intermittent fasting?
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.940]   So playing without having eaten.
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.340]   - I mean, the reason I ask,
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:52.180]   especially when you do a low carb diet,
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.420]   when I've done a person on a low carb diet,
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.900]   I'm able to fast for a long time,
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.540]   like eat once a day, maybe twice a day.
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.660]   But the mind is most focused
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:05.660]   on like really difficult thinking tasks when it's fasted.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.720]   It's an interesting,
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.260]   and a lot of people kind of talk about that.
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.460]   You're able to kind of like zoom in.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.140]   And if you're doing a low carb diet,
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.380]   you don't have the energy stable.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.940]   - No, that is true.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.780]   Maybe that will be interesting to try.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.260]   So what's happened for me is I played a few tournaments
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.460]   where I've had food poisoning.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.260]   And then that generally means
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:31.020]   that you're both sleep deprived and you have no energy.
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:36.020]   And what I've found is that it makes me very calm,
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.580]   of course, because I don't have the energy.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.820]   And it makes me super creative.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:43.660]   - Interesting.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:45.500]   - I think sleep deprivation, I think in general,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.140]   makes you creative.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:48.780]   Just the first thing that goes away
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.820]   is the ability to do the simple things.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.740]   That's what it affects you the most.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.580]   Like you cannot be precise.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.620]   So that's the only thing I'm worried about.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:02.020]   Like if I'm fasted, that I won't be...
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.300]   - Precise when I play.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.340]   But you might be more creative.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.180]   It's an interesting-
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:12.020]   - Fasted, yeah, potentially.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.020]   - What about you have been known to,
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.620]   on a rare occasion, play drunk?
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:19.420]   Is there a mathematical formula for,
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.260]   sort of on the X-axis, how many drinks you had,
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.820]   and on the Y-axis, your performance/creativity?
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.420]   Is there like an optimal for...
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.820]   Like would you suggest for the FIDIA World Championship
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.140]   that people would be required to drink?
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.460]   Would that change things in interesting ways?
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.260]   - Yeah, not at all.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:40.900]   Maybe for Rapid, but for Blitz,
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.900]   think if you're playing Blitz,
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.900]   you're mostly playing on short calculation and intuition.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.500]   And I think those are probably enhanced
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.220]   if you've had a little bit to drink.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:59.220]   - Can you explain the physiology of why it's enhanced?
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:03.260]   - You're just, you're thinking less.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.860]   You're more confident.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.700]   - Oh yeah, it's confidence.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.860]   - I think it's just confidence.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.820]   I think also like a lot of people
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:14.700]   feel like they're better at speaking languages,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.020]   for instance, if they've drunk a little bit.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.980]   It's just like removing these barriers.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.980]   I think that it's a little bit of the same in chess.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:27.580]   In 2012, I played the World Blitz Championship,
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   and then I was doing horribly for a long time.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.900]   I also had food poisoning there.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.540]   I couldn't play at all for three days.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.140]   So before the last break,
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.300]   I was in the middle of the pack,
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:46.940]   in, I don't know, 20th place or something.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:51.140]   And so I decided as the last gasp,
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.860]   I'm gonna go to the mini bar and just have a few drinks.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:58.060]   And what happened is that I came back
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.180]   and I was suddenly relaxed.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:03.500]   And I was playing fast and I was playing confident.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.620]   And I thought I was playing so well.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.580]   I wasn't playing nearly as well as I thought,
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.060]   but it still helped me.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.860]   Like I won my remaining eight games.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:14.580]   And if there had been one more round,
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.020]   I probably would have won the whole thing.
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.180]   But finally I was second.
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.980]   So generally I wouldn't recommend that,
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.140]   but maybe as a last resort sometimes,
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.900]   like if you feel that you have the ability,
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:29.460]   like obviously none of this is remotely relevant
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.820]   if you don't feel like you have the ability to begin with.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:34.060]   But if you feel like you have the ability,
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.060]   there are just factors that make it impossible
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.020]   for you to show it.
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:45.180]   Like numbing your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.900]   - Yeah, well, it's interesting, especially during training,
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.020]   you have all kinds of sports that have interacted
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:54.660]   with a lot of athletes and grappling sports.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:57.060]   It's different when you train under extreme exhaustion.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.340]   For example, you start becoming,
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.500]   you start to discover interesting things.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.900]   You start being more creative.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:07.420]   A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu-jitsu,
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.020]   they'll smoke weed.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:12.580]   It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:16.060]   that kind of enables that creative aspect.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.460]   It's interesting for training.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.420]   Of course, you can't rely on any one of those things too much
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.540]   but it's cool to throw in like a few drinks
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:25.100]   every once in a while to, yeah,
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.340]   one, first of all, to relax and have fun,
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.580]   and two, to kind of try things differently,
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.500]   to unlock a different part of your brain.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.060]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.860]   - What about supplements?
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.420]   Do you, you're a coffee guy?
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.260]   - Oh, no.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:42.580]   I quite like the taste of coffee.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.580]   But the thing is, I've never had a job.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.700]   So I've never needed to wake up early.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:55.700]   So my thought is basically that if I'm tired, I'm tired.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.940]   That's fine.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.540]   Then I'll, you know, then I'll work it out.
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:06.540]   So I don't want to ever make my brain get used to coffee.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:10.660]   Like if you see me drinking coffee,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:15.660]   that probably means that I'm massively,
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:19.060]   massively hungover and I don't,
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   I just want to try anything to make my brain work.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.260]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.260]   But for a lot of people, like you said, taste of coffee,
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.140]   for a lot of people, coffee is part of a certain
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.220]   kind of ritual.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.060]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.700]   - A joy, you know, so.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.300]   - No, I know that I would enjoy it a lot.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.140]   - Yeah.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:37.980]   - Though there's no question about that.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:39.020]   - Just you don't want to rely on it.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.100]   (laughing)
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:44.220]   - I also like the taste, so there's no problem there.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:47.660]   - What about exercise?
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.860]   So how does that, what, like, what, you know,
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:54.860]   a lot of people talk about the extreme stress
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:33:00.380]   that chest puts in your body, physically and mentally.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.900]   How do you prepare for that to be physically and mentally?
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.180]   Is it just through playing chess or do you do cardio
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.260]   and any of that kind of stuff?
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.980]   - This is kind of a bit up and down.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.980]   Like, as I said, in 2013, I was in great shape.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:18.860]   Like, I mean, generally I was exercising,
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:22.420]   doing sports every day, either playing football
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:26.860]   or tennis or even other sports.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.380]   Otherwise, if I couldn't do that,
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:33.380]   I would try and take my bike for a ride.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.700]   I had a few training camps and I played tennis
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.700]   against one of my seconds.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:42.020]   Like, he's not a super fit guy,
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:43.740]   but he's always been very good at tennis.
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:47.380]   And I never like played in any organized way.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:50.300]   And that was like, that was the perfect exercise
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.420]   because I was running around enough
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:58.620]   to make the games pretty competitive.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.900]   And it meant that he had to run a bit less as well.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   But he was just, he said like,
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:10.500]   he was shocked that if we played like for two hours,
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.540]   I wouldn't flinch at all.
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:14.380]   - Interesting.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.540]   So like a combination of fun
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:20.340]   and the differential between skill
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.780]   result in good cardio.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.460]   - Yeah, but it's just that,
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:29.220]   so in those days I was pretty fit in that sense.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.820]   I've always liked doing sports, but at times,
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.980]   I think in winter, especially,
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:37.780]   like I never had like a schedule.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.100]   So at times I let myself go a little bit
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:45.660]   and I've always kind of done it more for fun
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.540]   than like for a concrete benefit.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.940]   But now I'm at least after the pandemic,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:52.980]   I was not in great shape.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.300]   So now I'm trying to get back,
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:35:00.140]   get better habits and so on.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:05.140]   But I feel like I've always been the poster boy
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:11.100]   for making being fit a big thing in chess.
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:14.820]   And I always felt that it was not really deserved
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.380]   because I never liked doing weights much at all.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:23.940]   I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.780]   - You just love playing sports.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.540]   - I just love playing sports.
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.660]   So I think people confuse that
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.220]   because I'm not like massively athletic,
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:35.500]   but I am decent at sports
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:39.420]   and that sort of helped build that perception,
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:42.740]   even though others who are top level chess players,
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.500]   they're more fit like Karvana, for instance,
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:51.500]   he's really, really, his body is really, really strong.
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.340]   It's just that he doesn't-
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.820]   - He like goes to the gym and-
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.420]   - Yeah, he doesn't play sports.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.460]   That's the difference.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.700]   - And the thing about sports is also is just,
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.420]   it's an escape.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:05.420]   It helps you forget for a brief moment
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.140]   about like the obsessions,
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:10.100]   the pursuits of the main thing, which is chess.
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.380]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:16.420]   And I think it also helps your main pursuit
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:20.180]   to feel that you're even if not mastering,
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:24.220]   but like doing well in something else.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:28.460]   Like I found that if I just juggle a ball,
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   that makes me feel better before a game.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:34.700]   - So a skilled activity-
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:35.740]   - Juggle a football, yeah.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.900]   - Yeah, skilled activity that you can improve on over time.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.340]   It's like flexes the same kind of muscle,
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.980]   but another thing that you're much worse at.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:46.740]   It focuses you, relaxes you.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:47.900]   That's really interesting.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.180]   What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.900]   when he's training?
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.980]   So like what's a good training regimen
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.500]   in terms of daily kind of training
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:04.020]   that you have to put in across many days, months, and years
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.100]   to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.380]   - I would say when I'm at home,
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.220]   I do very, very little deliberate practice.
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.020]   I've never been that guy at all.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:18.860]   Like I could never force myself to just sit down and work.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.420]   - So deliberate practice, just to maybe you can educate me,
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.540]   for some grandmasters, what would that look like?
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.660]   Just doing puzzles kind of thing?
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.580]   - Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis.
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.140]   That would be the main things.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.700]   - Studying games?
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.820]   - Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:42.060]   But I feel like that's something that I do,
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.340]   but it's not deliberate.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:48.100]   It's like reading an article or reading a book.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:48.940]   - Got it.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:49.780]   - Like I love chess books.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.500]   I'll read just anything and I'll find something interesting.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.180]   - So chess books that are like on openings
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.020]   and stuff like that,
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.500]   or chess books that go over different games?
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.100]   - Yeah, books on...
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.540]   So there are three main categories.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.180]   There are books on openings and there are books on strategy
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.500]   and there are books on chess history.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:12.740]   And I find all of them very, very interesting.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.460]   - Like what fraction of the day would you say
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.300]   you have a chess board floating somewhere in your head?
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.380]   Meaning like you're thinking about it.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.700]   - Probably be a better question to ask how many hours a day
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:27.140]   I don't have a chess board floating in my head.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:28.660]   (laughing)
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.140]   - I mean, it could be just floating there
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.540]   and nothing's happening, but like...
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.860]   - I often do it parallel to some other activity though.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.100]   - And what does that look like?
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.900]   Like, are you daydreaming like different...
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.260]   Is it actual positions you're just fucking around with,
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:45.540]   like fumbling with different pieces in your head?
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:49.500]   - Often I've looked at a random game on my phone,
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.260]   for instance, or in a book,
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.740]   and then my brain just keeps going at the same position,
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.660]   analyzing it.
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:58.540]   And often it goes all the way, you know, to the end game.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.940]   - And those are actual games
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.300]   or you conjure up like fake games?
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:04.740]   - No, they were often based on real games.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.740]   And then I'm thinking like,
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.500]   oh, but it wouldn't be more interesting
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.620]   if the pieces were a little bit different.
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.940]   And then often I play it out from there.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.900]   - So you don't have a...
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:18.860]   Like you don't sit behind a computer or a chess board
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.700]   and you lay out the pieces and then you're...
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.980]   - I'm not at all a poster boy for deliberate practice.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:27.660]   I could never work that way.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.500]   My first coach, he gave me some...
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.900]   Exercises to do at home sometimes,
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:39.380]   but he realized at some point that wasn't gonna work.
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.420]   - Yeah.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:44.220]   - Because I wouldn't do it really or enjoy it.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:48.660]   So what he would do instead is that at the school
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.140]   where I had the trainings with him,
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.220]   there was this massive chess library.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.820]   So he was just like, yeah, pick out books.
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:40:00.380]   You can have anything you want.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.660]   Just pick out books you like
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.380]   and then you give back the next time.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:05.260]   So that's what I did instead.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.020]   Yeah, I just absolutely rated.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.740]   And then my next tournament,
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.540]   I will try out one of the openings from that book
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.460]   if it was an opening book and so on.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.540]   - Does it feel like a struggle, like challenging?
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.500]   Like to be thinking of those positions
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.940]   or is it fun and relaxing?
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.380]   - No, it's completely fine.
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.300]   I don't...
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.260]   - Like if it's a difficult position to figure out,
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.780]   you know, like to calculate.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.220]   - Then I go on to something else.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.380]   - Okay.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.900]   - Like if I can't figure it out, then, you know, I go on.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.660]   - Change it so that it's easier to figure out.
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:38.900]   There was a point in your life
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:42.300]   where Kasparov was interested in being your coach
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:43.540]   or at least training with you.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.540]   Why did you choose not to go with him?
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.860]   That's a pretty bold move.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.140]   Was there a good reason for this?
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:49.980]   - No.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:56.500]   The first homework exercise he gave me was to analyze.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.180]   Like he picked out, I think, three or four of my worst losses
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:05.180]   and he wanted me to analyze them and give him my thoughts.
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:08.340]   And it wasn't that there were painful losses or anything,
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.540]   that that was a problem.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:14.180]   I just didn't really enjoy that.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:19.180]   Also, I felt that this whole structured approach
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:22.260]   and everything, I just felt like from the start,
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.580]   it was a hassle.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:28.140]   So I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain,
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:32.140]   but everything else, I just, you know,
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:35.780]   couldn't see myself enjoying.
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:39.260]   And at the end of the day, I did then
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:42.180]   and always have played for fun.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.140]   That's always been the main reason.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.500]   - It's great that you had the confidence
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:50.420]   to sort of basically turn down the approach
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.700]   of one of the greatest chess players of all time
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.580]   at that time, probably the greatest chess player
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:55.700]   of all time.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:58.100]   - I don't think I thought of it that way.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.060]   I just thought this is not for me.
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.620]   I want to try another way.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.180]   I don't think I was particularly thinking
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:06.140]   that this is my one opportunity or anything.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.260]   It was just, yeah, I don't enjoy this.
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:09.540]   Let's try something else.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.420]   - When you were 13, you faced Kasparov
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.300]   and he wasn't able to beat you.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.860]   Can you go through that match?
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:17.820]   What did that feel like?
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.940]   How important was that?
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.900]   Was that, how epic was that?
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.100]   - We played three games.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.580]   I lost two and I drew one.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:26.980]   - Right, but one draw.
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.380]   - No, the one draw.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.140]   - But didn't you say that you kind of
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:32.740]   had a better position in that?
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.940]   - Yeah, I remember that day very well.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.340]   There was a Blitz game.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.300]   This was a Rapid tournament.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.220]   And there was a Blitz tournament the day before
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:45.940]   which determined the pairings for the Rapids.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.340]   - And for people who don't know,
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.260]   super short games are called bullet,
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.820]   kind of short games are called Blitz,
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:54.460]   semi short games are called Rapid.
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.300]   - Yeah.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.140]   (laughing)
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.940]   - And classic chess, I guess, is like very super long.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:01.700]   - Yeah, yeah, basically bullet
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.020]   is never played over the board.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.140]   So in terms of over the board chess,
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.540]   Blitz is the shortest.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:11.260]   Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and Blitz.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.780]   You need to have the skills of both.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.980]   And then classical is long.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.420]   The Blitz tournament, which didn't go so well.
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:19.580]   I got a couple of wins,
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.140]   but I was beaten badly in a lot of games,
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:23.980]   including by Gary.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.220]   And so there was the pairing that I had to play him,
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.660]   which is pretty exciting.
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.580]   So I remember I was so tired after the Blitz tournament,
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.380]   like I slept for 12 hours or something.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.460]   Then I woke up like, okay, I'll turn on my computer.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.180]   I'll search chess space for Kasparov.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.700]   And we'll go from there.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:44.220]   (laughing)
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.100]   So before that, I hadn't spent a lot of time
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.060]   specifically studying his games.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.980]   It was super intimidating
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.340]   because a lot of these openings I knew,
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:56.820]   I was like, oh, he was the first one to play that.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:57.860]   Oh, that was his idea.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.620]   I actually didn't know that.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.500]   So I was a bit intimidated before we played.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.580]   Then of course the first game,
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.620]   he arrived a bit late because they changed the time
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.980]   from the first day to the other, which was a bit strange.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:13.820]   And everybody else had noticed it, but him.
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.700]   Then he tried to surprise me in the opening.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:20.540]   I think psychologically the situation
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:21.820]   was not so easy for him.
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:23.420]   Clearly it would be embarrassing for him
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.820]   if he didn't win both games against me.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.780]   Then I was spending way too much time on my moves
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.220]   because I was playing Kasparov.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.020]   I was double checking everything too much.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.500]   Normally I would be playing pretty fast in those days.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:42.260]   And then at some point I calculated better than him.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.660]   He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.020]   I couldn't convert it though.
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.700]   I knew what line I had to go for
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.980]   in order to have a chance to win.
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.740]   But I thought like, I'll play a bit more carefully.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.820]   Maybe I can win still.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:58.300]   I couldn't.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:01.780]   And then I lost the second game pretty badly,
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.420]   which it wasn't majorly upsetting,
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:08.100]   but I felt that I had two black games against Kasparov,
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:09.700]   both in the Blitz and the Rapid.
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.820]   And I lost both of them without any fight whatsoever.
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:14.620]   I wasn't happy about that at all.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:19.100]   That was like less than I thought I could be able to do.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:24.100]   So to me, yeah, I was proud of that, but it was a gimmick.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:30.700]   I was like a very strong IM that had GM strength.
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.260]   I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.700]   makes a draw against Gary once in a while.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:38.540]   - Okay, for people who don't know.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.540]   - I mean, I understand that I'm 13,
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.660]   but like still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:48.860]   I mean, I guess it's a good thing that made me noticed,
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:51.620]   but apart from that, it wasn't, yeah.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:52.980]   - And for people who don't know,
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:56.140]   IM is international master and GM is grandmaster.
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.980]   And you were just on the, I guess,
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:01.260]   on the verge of becoming a youngest grandmaster ever.
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.260]   - I was the second youngest ever.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:06.140]   I think I'm like the seventh youngest now.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:08.060]   I mean, these kids these days.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:09.020]   - These kids these days.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:09.860]   - Yeah.
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:10.700]   (laughing)
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:11.540]   - Yeah, no.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.540]   - But I was the youngest grandmaster at the time.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.380]   - At the time.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:16.420]   - In the world, yeah.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.180]   - Yeah, so there is a, you know, you say it's gimmicky,
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.740]   but there's a romantic notion,
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:25.820]   especially as things have turned out, right?
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:26.660]   Like-
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.500]   - No, for sure.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.540]   - And have you talked to Gary since then about that?
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:31.660]   - No, not really.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.020]   I think he's embarrassed about that.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.260]   - He's still bitter, you think?
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.020]   - No, I don't think he's bitter,
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.780]   but I think the game in itself
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:41.500]   was a bit embarrassing for him.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:45.500]   - So even he can't see past, like-
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.700]   - No, no, no, I think he's completely fine with that.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.060]   I think like in retrospect, it's a good story.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:53.340]   He appreciates that.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.500]   I don't think that's the problem,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.140]   but it never made sense for me
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:58.380]   to broach the subject with him.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:03.060]   - Yeah, I just, it's funny just having interacted with Gary,
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:04.980]   now having talked to you.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:08.580]   There is a little thing you still hate losing,
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:11.220]   no matter how beautiful that moment is,
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.540]   'cause it's like, in a way it's a passing of the baton
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.860]   from one great champion to another, right?
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.940]   But you still just don't like the fact
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.180]   that you didn't play a good game
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.220]   from Gary's perspective.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:24.860]   He still is just annoyed probably
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:27.340]   that he could have played better.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:32.340]   - And we did, so we did work together in 2009 quite a lot.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:38.300]   And that corporation ended early 2010,
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:42.300]   but we did play a lot of training games in 2009,
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.180]   which was interesting because he was still very, very strong.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.980]   And at that time it was fairly equal.
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.460]   Like he was out playing me quite a bit,
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.460]   but I was fighting well, so it was pretty even then.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.780]   So, I mean, I appreciate those games a lot more
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:03.500]   than some random game from when I was 13.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:07.220]   And maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about,
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:12.220]   but I've always found it, at least based on that game,
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.100]   you couldn't tell that I was gonna take his spot.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:22.100]   Like I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.940]   in the World Rapid Championship in 2018.
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:30.700]   And I mean, granted he was part of the team
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.900]   that now won gold in the Chess Olympia,
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:34.140]   but he wasn't a crucial part.
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.660]   He barely played any games.
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:37.260]   Like it wasn't like I would think
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.820]   that he would become world champion because he beat me.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.220]   I'm always skeptical of those who said
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:44.540]   that they knew that I was gonna be world champion
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.340]   after that game or at all at that time.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:50.100]   I mean, it was easy to see
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:52.740]   that I would become a very, very strong player.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:56.140]   Everybody could see that, but to be the best in the world
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:58.820]   or one of the best ever, it's hard to say.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:01.620]   - It is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.460]   when he was 16 and 17.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.620]   - But hasn't that happened with other players though?
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:10.860]   - Yeah, but I just had a personal experience.
[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:14.700]   He did look different than, there's like magic there.
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.340]   Maybe you can't tell he would be one of the greatest ever,
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.340]   but there's still magic, but you're right.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.820]   Most of the time we're trying to project,
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:25.300]   we see a young kid being an older person
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:26.780]   and you start to think, okay,
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.260]   this could be the next great person.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.260]   And then we forget when they don't become that.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:31.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.380]   That's I think what happens.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.860]   - But when it does become--
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:38.300]   - Or maybe some people are just so good
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.140]   at seeing these patterns that they can actually see.
[01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:41.500]   - Aren't you supposed to do that kind of thing
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.140]   with fantasy football, like see the long shot
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:46.540]   and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:49.660]   - No, you make a lot of long shot bets
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.020]   and then some of them come good.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.540]   - And then people call you a genius for making the bet.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.820]   Well, let me ask you the goat question again,
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.260]   from fantasy perspective,
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.780]   can you make the case for the greatest chess player
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.140]   of all time for each, yourself, Magnus Carlsen,
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.300]   for Garry Kasparov, I don't know who else,
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:12.480]   Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Tal, anyone else?
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.460]   For Hikaru Nakamura?
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:17.300]   Just kidding.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:22.140]   - Yeah, I think I can make a case for myself,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.700]   for Garry and for Fischer.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.660]   So I'll start with Fischer.
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:28.980]   For him, it's very, very simple.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:33.700]   He was ahead of his time, but that's intangible.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.980]   You can say that about a lot of people.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:40.980]   But he had a peak from 1970 to '72
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.580]   when he was so much better than the others.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.900]   He won 20 games in a row.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:50.540]   Also the way that he played was so powerful
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.940]   and with so few mistakes that he just had no opposition there
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:59.940]   so he had just a peak that's been better than anybody.
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.740]   - The gap between first and second was tight.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.420]   - The gap between him and others was greater
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.500]   than it's ever been in history at any other time.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.900]   And that would be the argument for him.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:17.900]   For Garry, he's played in a very competitive era
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:21.500]   and he's beaten several generations.
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:22.740]   - He was the best.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:26.540]   - Well, he was the consensus best player,
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:29.580]   I would say, for almost 20 years,
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:34.580]   which nobody else has done, at least in recent time.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:37.740]   - So the longevity.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.700]   - The longevity, for sure.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:44.300]   Also at his peak, he was not quite the level
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:47.100]   of Fischer in terms of the gap,
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:50.260]   but it was similar to, or I think,
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:52.900]   even a little bit better than mine.
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:57.900]   As for me, I'm of course unbeaten as a world champion
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:00.220]   in five tries.
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:04.460]   I've been world number one for 11 years straight
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:07.700]   in an even more competitive era than Garry.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:10.020]   I have the highest chess rating of all time.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.020]   I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:19.100]   I think for me, the main argument would be about the era
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:24.100]   where the engines have leveled the playing field so much
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:28.660]   that it's harder to dominate.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.580]   And still, I haven't always been a clear number one,
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.940]   but I've been number one for 11 years.
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:39.380]   And for a lot of the time, the gap has been pretty big.
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:43.340]   So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:45.660]   I've said before, and I haven't changed my mind,
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:49.660]   that Garry generally edges it because of the longevity
[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:54.660]   in the competitive era, but there are arguments.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.740]   - But people also talk about you
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.260]   in terms of the style of play.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:01.420]   So it's not just about dominance or the height,
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.340]   it's just the creative genius of it.
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.340]   - Yeah, but I'm not interested in that.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.860]   (laughing)
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:11.580]   In terms of greatest of all time,
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:16.180]   I'm not interested in questions of style.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:20.220]   - So for Messi, you don't give credit for the style,
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.100]   for the stylistic?
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.300]   - I like, no, I like watching it.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:27.220]   - But you're not gonna give points for the,
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:30.020]   so Messi gets the best ever because of the finishing.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:34.340]   - No, it's not because of the finishing,
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.500]   it's because of his overall impact on the game
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.340]   is higher than anybody else's.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:40.180]   - Okay.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.380]   (laughing)
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:45.260]   - He contributes, he just contributes more to winning
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:46.940]   than anybody else does.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.980]   - What's, so you're somebody who is advocated for
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.740]   and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:58.740]   What would you say is, I mean, maybe the number one
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.340]   or maybe top three games of chess ever played?
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.820]   - That doesn't interest me at all.
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:05.860]   - You don't think of them as--
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:08.260]   - No, I don't think of it, I mean, I try to,
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:10.700]   I find the games interesting, I try to learn from them,
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:13.580]   but like trying to rank them has never interested me.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:16.940]   - What games pop out to you as like super interesting then?
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:20.980]   Is there things like where idea, like old school games
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:25.980]   where there's like interesting ideas that you go back
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:29.780]   or like you find surprising and pretty cool
[01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:32.140]   that those ideas were developed back then?
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:35.420]   Is there something that jumps to mind?
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:40.340]   - Yeah, there are several games of young Kasparov,
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.180]   like before he became world champion.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.860]   If you're gonna ask for like my favorite player
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:47.740]   or favorite style, that's probably--
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:48.740]   - Young Kasparov.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.580]   - Young Kasparov.
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:52.660]   - Can you describe stylistically or in any other way
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:57.020]   what young Kasparov was like that you like?
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.860]   - It was just an overflow energy in his play.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:00.900]   - So aggressive attacking chess.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.220]   - Yeah, extremely aggressive dynamic chess.
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:06.780]   It probably appeals to me a lot
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:11.380]   because these are the things that I cannot do as well,
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:15.700]   that it just feels very special to me.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.740]   But yeah, in terms of games,
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:21.780]   I never thought about that too much.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:28.060]   - Is there memories, big or small, weird, surprising,
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:33.820]   just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career,
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.740]   like stuff that pops out that people might not know about
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:40.020]   or just stuff when you look back and just makes you smile?
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:45.020]   - No, so I'll tell you about the most satisfying
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:46.740]   tournament victory of my career.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:52.380]   So that was the Norwegian Championship Under 11 in 2000.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.940]   Before that tournament, I was super anxious
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:56:00.100]   because I started like kind of late at chess.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.820]   I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:05.180]   and a lot of my competitors had already played
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:09.140]   for a couple of years or even three, four years
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.500]   at that point.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.300]   And the first time, so I played the Under 11 Championship
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:18.100]   in '99, that was like a little over the middle of the pack.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.060]   I'd never played against any of them before,
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:22.180]   so I didn't know what to expect at all.
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.780]   And then over the next year,
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:26.740]   I was like edging a little bit closer.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.740]   In each tournament, I felt like I was getting
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.020]   a little bit better.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.580]   And when we had the championship, I knew that I was ready,
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:38.820]   that I was now at the same level of the best players.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.300]   I was so anxious to show it.
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:44.660]   I remember I was just, the feeling of excitement
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:47.900]   and nervousness before the tournament was incredible.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:51.540]   The tournament was weird because I started out,
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:54.100]   I gave away a draw to a weaker player,
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:57.940]   whom I shouldn't have drawn to.
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:00.220]   And then I drew against the other guy
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:05.540]   who was clearly like the best or second best.
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:08.380]   And at that point, I thought it was over
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:12.820]   'cause I thought he wouldn't give away points to others.
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:16.100]   And then the very next day, he lost to somebody.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.180]   So the rest of the tournament, it was just like,
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.940]   I was always like playing my game and watching his.
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.660]   And we both won the rest of our games,
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:27.060]   but it meant that I was half a point ahead.
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.580]   Like the feeling when I realized that I was gonna win,
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:34.260]   that was just so amazing.
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:39.260]   It was like the first time that I was the best at my age.
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:43.740]   And at that point-
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:44.580]   - You were hooked.
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.220]   - Yeah, at that point I realized,
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.860]   I could actually be very good at this.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:51.820]   - So you kind of saw,
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:53.820]   what did you think your ceiling would be?
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:57.300]   Did you see that one day you could be the number one-
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.780]   - No, I didn't think that was possible at all.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:04.780]   But I thought I could be the best in Norway.
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:05.780]   - The best in Norway.
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:06.620]   - At that point.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:07.460]   - When did you first-
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.580]   - Because I started relatively late.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:10.420]   - Right, so yeah.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:15.420]   - And also, I knew that I studied a lot more than the others.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:19.340]   I knew that I had a passion that they didn't have.
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:23.340]   They saw chess as something like,
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:27.540]   it was a hobby, it was like an activity.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:32.540]   It was like going to football practice or any other sports.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:37.260]   Like you go, you practice like once or twice a week,
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.140]   and then you play a tournament at the weekend.
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:40.780]   That's what you did.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.180]   For me, it wasn't like that.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:45.660]   Like I would go with my books and my board
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.460]   every day after school.
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:53.940]   And I would just constantly be trying to learn new things.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:59.460]   I had like two hours of internet time
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.140]   on the computer each week.
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:04.260]   And I would always spend them on chess.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:10.580]   Like I think before I was 13 or 14,
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:15.940]   I'd never opened a browser
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:18.420]   for any other reason than to play chess.
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:22.660]   - Would you describe that as love or as obsession
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.660]   or something in between, it's everything?
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:26.620]   - Yeah, everything.
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:32.580]   So I mean, it wasn't hard for me to tell at that point
[01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:36.500]   that I had something that the other kids didn't
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:41.020]   because I was never the one to grasp something
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:41.980]   very, very quickly.
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:44.180]   But once I started, I always got hooked
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:46.260]   and then I never stopped learning.
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:49.260]   - What would you say, you've talked about the middle game
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:52.620]   as a place where you can play pure chess.
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:55.140]   What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:58.540]   Like the thing when you were 11.
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:01.820]   - What is beautiful to me is when your opponent
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:04.260]   can predict every single one of your moves
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:05.260]   and they still lose.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:07.100]   - How does that happen?
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:10.620]   - No, like it means that at some point early,
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:14.140]   your planning, your evaluation has been better
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:17.180]   so that you play just very simply, very clearly.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:19.900]   It looks like you did nothing special
[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.300]   and your opponent lost without a chance.
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:25.260]   - So how do you think about that, by the way?
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.940]   Are you basically narrowing down this gigantic tree
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:31.140]   of options to where your opponent has less and less
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.420]   and less options to win, to escape, and then they're trapped?
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:37.660]   - Yeah, essentially.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:40.100]   - Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves,
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:44.100]   to the positions, to the elegance of like
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.820]   the dynamics of the game that you just find beautiful
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:52.820]   that doesn't, that, where you forget about the opponent?
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:58.260]   - General, I try and create harmony on the board.
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:00.820]   Like what I would usually find harmonious
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:05.500]   is that the pieces work together,
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:08.260]   that they protect each other,
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:13.260]   and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:16.980]   Or if they are suboptimally placed,
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.060]   they can be improved pretty easily.
[02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:23.300]   Like I hate when I have one piece that I know
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.300]   is badly placed and I cannot improve it.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:29.420]   - Yeah, when you're thinking about the harmony of the pieces
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:30.580]   and when you're looking at the position,
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:35.580]   you're evaluating it, are you looking at the whole board?
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:41.780]   Or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:44.460]   and like dancing together kind of thing?
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:47.300]   - I would say it's more of the latter
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:50.580]   that would be more precise that you look.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:54.980]   I mean, I look mostly closer to the middle,
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.620]   but then I would focus on one,
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:00.060]   like there are usually like one grouping of pieces
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:04.500]   on one side and then some more closer to the other side.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.260]   So I would think of it a little bit that way.
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:11.940]   - So, and everything's kind of gravitating to the middle.
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.940]   - If it's going well, then yes.
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:15.180]   - And in harmony.
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:16.740]   - Yeah, in harmony.
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:20.180]   Like if you can control the middle,
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:22.980]   you can more easily attack on both sides.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:26.700]   That applies to pretty much any game.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:27.620]   It's as simple as that.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:32.620]   And like attacking on one side without control of the middle
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:37.540]   would feel very non-harmonious for me.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:40.020]   Like I talked about the 10th game
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:43.620]   in the world championship,
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.900]   like that's the time I was the most nervous.
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:50.060]   And it was because it was a kind of attack that I hate
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.460]   where you just have to, you're abandoned one side
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:57.620]   and you, the attack has to work.
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:00.060]   There was one side and part of the middle as well,
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:01.860]   which I didn't control at all.
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:05.620]   And that's like the opposite of harmony for me.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:10.540]   - What advice would you give to chess players
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.580]   of different levels, how to improve in chess?
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:16.940]   Very beginner, complete beginner.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:19.780]   I mean, at every level, is there something you can-
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.780]   - It's very hard for me to say,
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:25.860]   because I mean, the easiest way is like,
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.060]   love chess, be obsessed.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:29.780]   - Well, that's a really important statement.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:31.940]   - That doesn't work for everybody.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:32.780]   So I feel like-
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:34.620]   - It can feel like a grind.
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:37.540]   So you're saying if the less it can feel like a grind,
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:38.860]   the better, the better.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:39.700]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.820]   - That's the case for you.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:41.660]   - That's for sure.
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:46.620]   But I'm also very, very skeptical about giving advice
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:50.940]   because I think, again, my way only works
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:55.940]   if you have some combination of talent and obsession.
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:59.580]   So I'm not sure that I'd generally recommend it.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:02.940]   Like what I've done doesn't go with
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:06.540]   what most coaches suggest for their kids.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:09.740]   I've been lucky that I've had coaches from early on
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:11.860]   that have been very, very hands-off
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.660]   and just allowed me to do my thing, basically.
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:17.140]   - Well, there's a lot to be said
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:20.540]   about cultivating the obsession.
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:24.740]   Like really letting that flourish
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:26.940]   to where you spend a lot of hours
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:29.780]   like with the chessboard in your head
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:31.780]   and it doesn't feel like a struggle.
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:35.940]   - No, so like just letting me do my thing.
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:37.300]   Like if you give me a bunch of work,
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.500]   it will probably feel like a chore.
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.620]   And if you don't give me,
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:42.900]   I will spend all of that time on my own
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.140]   without thinking that it's work
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:47.660]   or without the thought that I'm doing this
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.780]   to improve my chess.
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:52.180]   - Well, in terms of learning stuff like books,
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:56.260]   there's one thing that's relatively novel
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:58.100]   from your perspective, people are starting now,
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:59.020]   is there's YouTube.
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.940]   There's a lot of good YouTubers.
[02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:02.860]   You're a part-time YouTuber.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:04.340]   You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.
[02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:06.900]   - Yeah, I have, but if you've seen my YouTube,
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:07.740]   it's mostly like--
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:08.580]   - It's very--
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:09.780]   - It's not--
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:10.620]   - It's carefree.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.020]   - Definitely not high effort content.
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:16.540]   - Yeah, but do you like any particular YouTubers?
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:19.500]   I could just recommend like stuff I've seen.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:23.740]   So Agadmar, Gotham Chess, Botes Live.
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:27.660]   I really like St. Louis Chess Club,
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:32.180]   Daniel Naroditsky and John Bartholomew.
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:33.060]   Those are good channels,
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.700]   but is there something you can recommend?
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:36.300]   - No, all of them are good.
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:41.860]   You know, the best recommendation I could give
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.540]   is Agadmar, purely--
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:47.100]   - How much did he pay you to say that?
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:51.180]   - No, so the thing about that is that I haven't really,
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:53.540]   I have, so I can tell you I've never watched
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:56.780]   any of his videos from start to finish.
[02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:59.940]   I'm not like, I'm not the target audience, obviously.
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:03.820]   But I think the only chess YouTube video
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:07.060]   that my dad has ever watched from start to finish
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:08.540]   is Agadmar.
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:12.300]   And he said, like, I watched one of his videos.
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:14.580]   I wanted to know what it was all about.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:19.020]   Because I think Agadmar is like the same strength
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:21.180]   as my father, or maybe just a little bit weaker,
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:23.300]   like 1900 or something.
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.700]   My father is probably about 2000.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:28.100]   And my father has played chess his whole life.
[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.180]   He loves, he absolutely loves the game.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:32.740]   It was like, that's the only time he's actually sat
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:33.820]   through one of those videos.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.540]   And he said, like, yeah, I get it, I enjoy it.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:39.340]   So that's the best recommendation I could give.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:44.220]   That's the only channel that my father actually enjoys.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:45.060]   - This is hilarious.
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:47.340]   I talked to him before this to ask him
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.940]   if he has any questions for you.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:51.700]   And he said, no, just do your thing.
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:52.540]   You know what you're doing.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:53.380]   - No, he's so careful.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:54.780]   He wouldn't do that.
[02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:59.620]   - He did mention jokingly about Evans' Gambit, I think.
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:00.460]   Is that a thing?
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:01.460]   Evans' Gambit?
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:03.140]   It's some weird thing he made up.
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.700]   It might be an inside joke.
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.780]   I don't know, but he asked me to.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:07.620]   Well, anyway.
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:10.260]   - Yeah, I didn't even get the--
[02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:11.860]   - It's something he made up.
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:15.180]   - I didn't even realize that he plays the Evans' Gambit.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.060]   Like, he plays a lot of Gambits that are--
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:18.420]   - Wait, Evans' Gambit is a thing?
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:19.460]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a thing.
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:22.620]   Like, that's an old opening from the 1800s.
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:25.180]   Captain Evans apparently invented it.
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:26.700]   - Why would he mention that particular one?
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:28.980]   There's something hilarious about that one.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:29.820]   - I don't know.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:34.380]   I don't think I've ever faced the Evans' Gambit in a game.
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:37.820]   - I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:42.820]   - But I mean, he's played a lot of other Gambits.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.460]   Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.900]   So this, maybe this is called the Evans' Gambit as well.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:52.540]   But I just know it as like the 2G4 Gambit.
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.780]   Maybe this is the one.
[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:57.900]   Like this one he has played a bunch.
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:04.260]   And he's been telling me a lot about his games in this line.
[02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.540]   He's like, "Oh, it's not so bad."
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:09.380]   And I'm like, "Yeah, but you're a pawn down."
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:10.780]   But I can sort of see it.
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:12.860]   I can sort of understand it.
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:16.700]   And he's proud of the fact that nobody told him
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:17.780]   to play this line or anything.
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:19.940]   He came up with it himself.
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:23.060]   And there's this, I'll tell you another story
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:23.900]   about my father.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:26.060]   So there's this line that I call
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.740]   the Henry Carlson line.
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:36.300]   So at some point, he never knew a lot of openings in chess,
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:40.940]   but I taught him a couple of openings as black.
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:45.460]   It's the Sveshnikov Sicilian
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:48.180]   that I played a lot myself also
[02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:52.340]   during the world championship in 2018.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:55.100]   I won a bunch of games in 2019 as well.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:55.940]   So that's one opening.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:58.780]   And I also taught him as black to play the Ragosin defense.
[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:04.180]   And then, so the Ragosin defense goes like this.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.940]   It's characterized by this bishop move.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:15.140]   And so he would play those openings pretty exclusively
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:17.780]   and as black in the tournaments that he did play.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:20.780]   And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like,
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:23.820]   that's the only, two of my sisters play,
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:26.100]   have played a bunch of chess tournaments as well.
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:29.020]   And that's the only opening they know as well.
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:32.300]   So my family's repertoire is very narrow.
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:35.660]   So this is the system.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.060]   Black goes here and then we all from white takes the pawn
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:39.300]   and black takes the pawn.
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:45.140]   So at some point I was watching one of my father's
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:46.380]   online blitz game.
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:52.500]   And as white, he played this, this.
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:54.340]   So this is called the Karakhan defense.
[02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:55.580]   He took the pawn,
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:10:00.580]   was taken back and then he went with the knight.
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:05.340]   His opponent went here and then he played a bishop here.
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:08.300]   So I'd never seen this opening before.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:13.300]   And I was like, wow, how on earth did he come up with that?
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.420]   And he said, no, I just played the Ragosin
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:16.580]   with the different colors,
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.100]   because if the knight was here,
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:19.700]   it would be the same position.
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:22.140]   I was like, I never, I was like,
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.140]   how am I like one of the best 20 players in the world?
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:28.980]   And I've never thought about that.
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:30.860]   So I actually started playing,
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:34.140]   I started playing this line as white
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:35.540]   with pretty decent results.
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:39.460]   And it actually became kind of popular.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:42.780]   And everybody who asked about the line,
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.740]   it's like, I would always tell them,
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:45.980]   yeah, that's the Henry Carlson.
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:48.300]   I wouldn't necessarily explain why it was called that.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.100]   I would just always call it that.
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:51.500]   So I really hope at this point,
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:54.380]   at some point this line will be,
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.700]   will find its rightful name.
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.940]   - In the, yeah, it finds its way into the history books.
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:03.900]   Can you, what'd you learn about life from your dad?
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.100]   What role has your dad played in your life?
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:10.500]   - He's taught me a lot of things,
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:14.660]   but most of all, as long as you win a chess,
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:16.100]   then everything else is fine.
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:23.220]   I think my, especially my father,
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:24.500]   but my parents in general,
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:29.500]   they always wanted me to get a good education
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:33.700]   and find a job and so on.
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:35.100]   Even though my father loves chess
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:36.780]   and he wanted me to play chess,
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:41.500]   I don't think he had any plans for me to be professional.
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:44.060]   I think things changed at some point.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.860]   Like I was less and less interested in school
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:50.740]   and for a long time,
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:52.900]   we were kind of going back and forth,
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:55.740]   fighting about that, especially my father,
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:57.660]   but also my mother a little bit.
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.900]   It was at times a little bit difficult.
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:01.140]   - They wanted you to go to school.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.300]   - Yeah, they sort of wanted me to do more school,
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:05.580]   to have more options.
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:08.740]   And then I think at some point,
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.180]   they just gave up.
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:15.580]   But I think that sort of coincided
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:17.420]   when I was actually starting to make real money
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:18.500]   of tournaments.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:23.100]   And after that, everything's been sort of easy
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:25.220]   in terms of the family.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:29.900]   They've never put any pressure on me
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:33.020]   or they've never put any demands on me.
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:33.860]   They're just, yeah,
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:35.300]   my eyes has to focus on chess.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:39.580]   That's it.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:41.380]   I think they taught me in general
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:43.900]   to be curious about the world
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:48.900]   and to get a decent general education,
[02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:51.220]   not necessarily from school,
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:55.700]   but just knowing about the world around you
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.700]   and knowing history and being interested in society.
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:04.940]   I think in that sense, they've done well.
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:07.860]   - And he's been with you throughout your chess career.
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:09.820]   I mean, there's something to be said
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.820]   about just family support and love that you have.
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:18.900]   This world is a lonely place.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:20.740]   It's good to have people around you there
[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:24.180]   like they got your back kind of.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.740]   - Yeah, it's a cliche,
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:29.060]   but I think to some extent,
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:32.300]   all the people you surround yourself with,
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:36.780]   they can help you a lot.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:41.100]   It's only family that only has their own interests at heart.
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.980]   And so for that reason,
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:48.220]   my father's the only one that's been constantly
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:51.380]   in the team that he's always been around.
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:52.700]   And it's for that reason
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.980]   that I know he has my back no matter what.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:58.940]   - Now, there's a cliche question here,
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:03.820]   but let's try to actually get to some deep truth perhaps.
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:06.260]   But people who don't know much about chess
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:08.860]   seem to like to use chess as a metaphor
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:10.740]   for everything in life.
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:14.540]   But there is some aspect to the decision-making,
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.420]   to the kind of reasoning involved in chess
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:19.180]   that's transferable to other things.
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:23.620]   Can you speak to that in your own life and in general?
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:27.900]   The kind of reasoning involved with chess,
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:32.420]   how much does that transfer to life out there?
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:34.900]   - It just helps you make decisions.
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.060]   - Of all kinds.
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.220]   - Yeah, that would be my main takeaway,
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.900]   that you learn to make informed guesses
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.620]   in a limited amount of time.
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:45.660]   - I mean, does it frustrate you when
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:49.500]   you have geopolitical thinkers and leaders,
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:52.780]   Henry Kissinger will often talk about geopolitics
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:55.740]   as a game of chess or 3D chess.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:58.260]   Is that too oversimplified of a projection?
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:02.220]   Or do you think that the kind of deliberations
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:04.820]   you have on the world stage is similar
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:08.620]   to the kind of decision-making you have on the chessboard?
[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:11.540]   - Well, I'm never trying to get reelected
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:13.060]   when I play a game of chess.
[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:14.740]   (laughing)
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:16.780]   - There's no special interest, you have to get happy.
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:18.900]   - Yeah, that kind of helps.
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:23.020]   No, I can understand that.
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:25.540]   Obviously, for every action, there's a reaction,
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:29.700]   and you have to calculate far ahead.
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.580]   It probably would be a good thing
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:35.860]   if more big players on the international scene
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:40.100]   thought a little bit more like a chess player in that sense,
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:42.420]   like trying to make good decision
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:46.380]   based on limited amounts of data,
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:49.620]   rather than thinking about other factors,
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.100]   but it's so tough.
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:55.260]   But it does annoy me when people make moves
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:58.220]   that they know are wrong for different reasons.
[02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:00.460]   - And they should know, if they did some calculation,
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.300]   they should know they're wrong.
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:04.580]   - Yeah, exactly, that they should know that are wrong.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:08.420]   And so much politics is like,
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:13.260]   you're often asked to do something
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:17.340]   when it would be much better to do nothing.
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:20.220]   (laughing)
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:21.900]   No, but that happens in chess all the time.
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:24.060]   Like, you have a choice.
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:28.500]   Like, I often tell people that in certain situations,
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:29.780]   you should not try and win,
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:32.620]   you should just let your opponent lose.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:35.980]   And that happens in politics all the time.
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:40.540]   But yeah, just let your opponents
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.340]   continue whatever they're doing, and then you'll win.
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.740]   Don't try to do something just to do something.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:50.380]   Often, they say in chess that having a bad plan
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.380]   is better than having no plan.
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:53.860]   It's absolute nonsense.
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:58.700]   - I forget what General said, but it was like,
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:01.820]   don't interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:06.820]   - Yeah, also Petrosyan, the former world champion,
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:11.940]   said when your opponent wants to play Dutch defense,
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:13.380]   don't stop them.
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:16.180]   I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:21.220]   - Actually, this reminds me,
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:24.060]   is there something you found really impressive
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:26.180]   about "Queen's Gambit," the TV show?
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:27.220]   You know, that's one of the things
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:30.220]   that really captivated the public imagination about chess.
[02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:31.260]   People who don't play chess
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:33.660]   became very curious about the game,
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:36.100]   about the beauty of the game, the drama of the game,
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:37.100]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:38.940]   Is there, in terms of accuracy,
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:41.260]   in terms of the actual games played,
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:44.300]   that you found impressive?
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:46.980]   - First of all, they did the chess well,
[02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:48.300]   they did it accurately.
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:51.740]   And also, they found actual games and positions
[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:53.980]   that I'd never seen before.
[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:55.140]   It really captivated me.
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:59.500]   Like, I would not follow the story at times.
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:01.340]   I was just trying to, wow,
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:03.900]   where the hell did I find that game?
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:05.980]   I was trying to solve the positions.
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:09.380]   - So, Beth Harmon, the main character,
[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:12.580]   were you impressed by the play she was doing?
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:15.340]   Was there a particular style
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:17.260]   that they developed consistently?
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:18.660]   - She was just, at the end,
[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:20.740]   she was just totally universal.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:25.020]   Like, at the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive,
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:28.060]   but no, she was absolutely universal.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:30.980]   - Wait, what adjective are you using?
[02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:34.900]   - Universal in the sense that she could play in any style.
[02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:37.020]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:38.820]   And was dominant in that way.
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.420]   So, wow, so there was a development in style, too,
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.300]   throughout the show.
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:43.140]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:44.620]   - It's really interesting they did that.
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:45.860]   - Yeah.
[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:49.020]   And it actually happened with me a bit as well.
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:51.660]   Like, I started out really aggressive.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:56.420]   Then I became probably too technical at some point,
[02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:58.180]   taking a little bit too few risks
[02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:00.060]   and not playing dynamic enough.
[02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:03.300]   And then I started to get a little bit better at dynamics
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:05.740]   so that now I'm, I would say,
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:09.860]   definitely the most universal player in terms of style.
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:12.260]   - Are there any skills in chess
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:14.340]   that are transferable to poker?
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:17.700]   So as you're playing around with poker a little bit now,
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:19.900]   how fundamentally different of a game is it?
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:23.740]   - What I find the most transferable probably
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:28.740]   is not letting past decisions dictate future thinking.
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:32.380]   - Yeah.
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:34.780]   But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:37.260]   and all that kind of stuff, what about bluffing?
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:39.820]   - I bluff way too much.
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:42.460]   - It does seem you enjoy bluffing,
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:45.900]   and Daniel Negreanu was saying that you're quite good at it.
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:49.620]   - But yeah, it has very little material to go by.
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:50.660]   - Sample size is small.
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:51.580]   - Yeah.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:53.300]   No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:57.540]   for more of the gambling aspects, the thrill of.
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:59.700]   - So not the technical aspect of the bluffing
[02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:01.940]   like you would on the chessboard.
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:03.460]   - Not bluffing in the same sense,
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:05.460]   but there is some element.
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:09.060]   But I do enjoy it on the chessboard.
[02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:13.340]   Like if I know that like, oh, I successfully scared away
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.780]   my opponent from making the best move,
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.620]   that's of course satisfying.
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:20.820]   - In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, right?
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:22.460]   That you represent something,
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:25.140]   you scare away your opponent in the same kind of way.
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:27.540]   - And also like you tell a story,
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:30.460]   you try and tell a story and then they believe it.
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:32.660]   - Yeah, tell a story with your betting,
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:36.860]   with all the different other cues.
[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.300]   - Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies?
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:43.340]   So it's almost like another layer on top of it, right?
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:48.340]   Like it's the uncertainty in the cards,
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:52.660]   but the betting, there's so much freedom to the betting.
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:54.620]   - I'm not very good at that.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:58.860]   So I cannot say that I understand it completely.
[02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:03.860]   You know, when it comes to different sizing and all that,
[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:05.700]   I just haven't studied it enough.
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.340]   - How much of luck is part of poker, would you say,
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:12.020]   from what you've seen versus skill?
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:14.100]   - I mean, it's so different in the sense
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.620]   that you can be one of the best players in the world
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.620]   and lose two or three years in a row
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:23.620]   without that being like a massive outlier.
[02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:27.700]   - Okay, the thing that more than one person told me
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.800]   that you're very good at is trash talking.
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:32.860]   - I don't think I am.
[02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:37.860]   A lot of people who make those observations about me,
[02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:40.700]   I think they just expect very, very little.
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:44.940]   So they expect from the best chess player in the world,
[02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:49.500]   that just anything that's non-robotic is interesting.
[02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:52.540]   Also, when it comes to trash talking,
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:54.540]   like I have the biggest advantage in the world
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:56.260]   that I'm the best at what I'm doing.
[02:21:56.260 --> 02:21:58.540]   So trash talking becomes very, very, very easy
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:21:59.980]   because I can back it up.
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:02.500]   - Yeah, yeah, but a lot of people
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:04.940]   that are extremely good at stuff don't trash talk
[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.140]   and they're not good at it.
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:07.580]   - I don't think I'm very good at it.
[02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:09.980]   It's just that I can back it up,
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:12.140]   which makes it seem that I'm better.
[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:14.740]   And also-- - You're even doing it now.
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:18.980]   - Also being non-robotic or not completely robotic.
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:21.580]   - Yeah, yeah, you're not trash talking,
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:23.620]   you're just stating facts, that's right.
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:28.620]   Have you ever considered that there would be trash talking
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:31.540]   over the chess board in some of the big tournaments?
[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:34.860]   Like adding that kind of component, or even talking?
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:38.860]   Would that completely distract from the game of chess?
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:40.940]   - No, I think it could be funny.
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:44.500]   When people play offline games,
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:46.580]   when they play Blitz games,
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:48.020]   people trash talk all the time.
[02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:49.620]   It's a normal part of the game.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:54.580]   - So you emphasize fun a lot.
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:58.820]   Do you think we're living inside of a simulation
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:01.060]   that is trying to maximize fun?
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:08.980]   - But that's only happened for the last 100 years or so.
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:12.700]   - Fun has always been increasing, I think.
[02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.340]   - Yeah, okay, it's always been increasing,
[02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:16.900]   but I feel like it's been increasing exponentially.
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:19.260]   - Yeah.
[02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:22.580]   - I mean, or at least the importance of fun.
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:24.980]   But I guess it depends on the society as well.
[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:29.780]   Like in the West, we've had such a Christian influence.
[02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:33.900]   And I mean, Christianity hasn't exactly embraced
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:37.380]   the concept of fun over time.
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:38.420]   - Well, actually, to push back,
[02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:40.580]   I think forbidding certain things
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:42.300]   kind of makes them more fun.
[02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:44.700]   So sometimes I think you need to say,
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:46.540]   "You're not allowed to do this."
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:48.380]   And then a lot of people start doing it,
[02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:49.740]   and then they have fun doing that.
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:53.580]   It's like it's doing a thing
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:55.500]   in the face of the resistance of the thing.
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:57.060]   So whenever there's resistance,
[02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:59.140]   that does somehow make it more fun.
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:02.420]   - Oppressive regimes has always been
[02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:03.820]   kind of good for comedy, no?
[02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:08.740]   Like, no, but I heard, supposedly, like in the Soviet Union,
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:12.060]   I don't know about fun, but supposedly comedy,
[02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:14.260]   like at least underground, it thrives.
[02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:16.860]   - Yeah, there's a, well, no, it permeates the entire culture.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:20.420]   There's a dark humor that sort of the cruelty,
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.940]   the absurdity of life really brings out the humor
[02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:26.820]   amongst the populace, plus vodka on top of that.
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:29.660]   But this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:34.660]   that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely,
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:40.020]   that it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:41.340]   seems to be the thing that--
[02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:44.740]   - So it happens more often than it should.
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:49.180]   And it somehow becomes viral in our modern connected world.
[02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:53.380]   And so the fun stuff, the memes spread,
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.820]   and then we start to optimize for the fun meme
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.580]   that seems to be a fundamental property
[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:00.360]   of the reality we live in.
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:06.500]   And so emerges the fun maximizer in all walks of life,
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:11.500]   like in chess, in poker, in everything.
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:14.660]   You're skeptical.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:15.940]   - No, I'm not skeptical.
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:19.460]   I'm just taking it all in.
[02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:24.060]   But I find it interesting and not at all impossible.
[02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:26.740]   - Do you ever get lonely?
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:27.820]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:32.660]   Like a chess player's life is, by definition, pretty lonely.
[02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:36.660]   Because you have nobody else to blame but yourself
[02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:39.700]   when you lose or you don't achieve the results
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.180]   that you wanna achieve.
[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:44.540]   - So it's difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere.
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:46.340]   It's in your own mind.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.180]   - Yeah.
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:48.580]   - It's you versus yourself, really.
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:49.420]   - Yeah, really.
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:55.260]   But it's part of the profession.
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:58.540]   But I think any sport or activity
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:02.580]   where it's just you and your own mind,
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:04.780]   it's just by definition lonely.
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:07.020]   - Are you worried that it destroys you?
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:08.140]   - Oh, not at all.
[02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:10.660]   As long as I'm aware of it, then it's fine.
[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:15.660]   And I don't think the inherent loneliness
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:20.500]   of my profession really affects the rest of my life
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:21.740]   in a major way.
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:26.780]   - What role does love play in the human condition
[02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:30.780]   and in your lonely life of calculation?
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:35.940]   - You know, I'm like everybody else,
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:39.580]   I'm just trying, you know.
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.580]   - Trying to find love?
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:43.900]   - No, not necessarily like trying to find love.
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.740]   Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:48.540]   I'm just trying to find my way.
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:49.380]   - Yeah.
[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:54.380]   - And my love for the game,
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:56.060]   obviously it comes and goes a little bit,
[02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:59.420]   but there's always at least some level of love.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:02.020]   So that doesn't go away.
[02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:05.740]   But I think in other parts of life,
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:10.740]   I think it's just about doing things that make you happy,
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.140]   that give you joy,
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:16.340]   that also makes you more receptive to love in general.
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:21.340]   So that has been my approach to love now for quite a while,
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:25.300]   that I'm just trying to live my best life
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:30.300]   and then the love will come when it comes.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:33.580]   And in terms of romantic love,
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:35.900]   it has come and gone in my life.
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.100]   It's not there now,
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:42.820]   but I'm not worried about that.
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.900]   I'm more worried about, you know,
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:47.580]   not worried, but more like trying to just
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:50.980]   be a good version of myself.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:53.140]   I cannot always be the best version of myself,
[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:55.140]   but at least try to be good.
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:56.540]   - Yeah, and keep your heart open.
[02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:59.380]   What is this Daniel Johnston song?
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:01.740]   "True love will find you in the end."
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:03.180]   - No, it may or may not.
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:06.220]   But it will only find you if,
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:08.420]   oh fuck, how does it go?
[02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:10.860]   If you're looking, so like you have to be open to it.
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:11.700]   - Yeah.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:12.860]   - It may or may not.
[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:13.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:15.740]   And no matter what, you're going to lose it in the end
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:18.020]   because it all ends, the whole thing ends.
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:18.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:22.380]   So I don't think stressing over that,
[02:28:22.380 --> 02:28:26.380]   like obviously it's so human
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:28.620]   that you can't help it to some degree,
[02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:30.940]   but I feel like stressing over love,
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:34.940]   that's the blueprint for whether you're looking
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.540]   or you're not looking, or you're in a relationship
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:42.740]   or marriage or anything, like stressing over it
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:46.300]   is like the blueprint for being unhappy.
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:49.260]   - Just to clarify confusion I have,
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:51.940]   just a quick question, how does the knight move?
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:55.820]   - So the knight moves in an L,
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:29:01.260]   and unlike in shogi, it can move both forwards and backwards.
[02:29:01.260 --> 02:29:05.740]   It is quite a nimble piece.
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:08.060]   It can jump over everything,
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:10.100]   but it's less happy in open position
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.780]   where it has to move from side to side quickly.
[02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:18.140]   I am generally more of a bishop's guy myself
[02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:19.500]   for the old debate.
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:24.420]   I just prefer quality over the intangibles,
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:28.420]   but I can appreciate a good knight once in a while.
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:32.180]   - Last simple question, what's the meaning of life?
[02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:33.660]   Magnus Carlsen.
[02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:36.140]   - There is obviously no meaning to life.
[02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:37.500]   - Is that obvious?
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:39.420]   - I think we're here by accident.
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:42.220]   There's no meaning, it ends at some point,
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:43.660]   but it's still a great thing.
[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:47.140]   - You can still have fun even if there's no meaning.
[02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:48.220]   - Yeah, you can still have fun,
[02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:52.740]   you can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be,
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:55.660]   but I'm pretty sure there's no special meaning,
[02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:59.620]   and trying to find it also doesn't make
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:01.340]   a whole lot of sense to me.
[02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:05.700]   For me, life is both meaningless and meaningful
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:09.020]   for just being here, trying to make,
[02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:10.420]   not necessarily the most of it,
[02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:13.140]   but the things that make you happy,
[02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:15.660]   both short-term and also long-term.
[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:18.540]   - Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy.
[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.340]   - It certainly does.
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:22.660]   - And one of those is having a conversation
[02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:25.740]   with you, Magnus, it's a huge honor to talk to you.
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:28.140]   Thank you so much for spending this time with me.
[02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:29.940]   I can't wait to see what you do in this world,
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:32.780]   and thank you for creating so much elegance and beauty
[02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:34.220]   on the chessboard and beyond.
[02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:36.140]   So, thanks for talking today, brother.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:38.300]   - Thank you so much, thanks for having me.
[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:42.660]   I wanted to say this at the start,
[02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:44.220]   but I never really got the chance.
[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:49.220]   I was always a bit apprehensive about doing this podcast,
[02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:50.900]   because you are a very smart guy,
[02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:54.380]   and your audience is very smart,
[02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:58.980]   and I always had a bit of imposter syndrome.
[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:03.500]   So, I'll tell you this now, after the podcast,
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:07.660]   so please do judge me, but I hope you've enjoyed it.
[02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:09.740]   - I loved it, you're a brilliant man.
[02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:12.680]   And I love the fact that you have imposter syndrome,
[02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:16.480]   because a lot of us do, and so that's beautiful to see,
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:19.180]   even at the very top, you still feel like an imposter.
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:22.940]   Thank you, brother, thanks for talking today.
[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:24.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
