[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.360]   This episode was hosted by the Chicago Virtual Chapter
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.160]   and recorded May 5th, 2021.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.320]   It features James Please, the developer of the FICALC product.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.040]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's investing
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.120]   philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.600]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.760]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   OK, perfect.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.840]   Yeah, so thanks for taking the time, again,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960]   on such short notice to join this chat with me
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   and hear a little bit about FICALC.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.440]   I guess a little bit of history on the app is I've
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.000]   been a big fan of FIRACALC and CFIRSIM
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.120]   and other retirement calculators for some time.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   And I kind of had three goals going into building this app.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840]   One was I wanted it to work on a mobile phone
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   because I use my mobile phone a lot.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   And just in my experience in the industry,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.600]   I know more and more people are using their mobile phones.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480]   So that was one goal that I wanted.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880]   And then another goal that I wanted
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.080]   was when I first went to those calculators,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.480]   I was a little bit overwhelmed because they seemed so complex.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.640]   So it was really important to me that I
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.000]   create a lot of guides that document
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.080]   how the calculator works.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.880]   And really, the goal of the guides
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.200]   is if anyone has any questions about it,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.600]   they should be able to find it here.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   I'm not sure how successful I was.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.080]   Maybe you guys can let me know.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.200]   But yeah, so that was kind of the goal behind the guides.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.600]   And then the third thing that I wanted
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.000]   was for there to be at least the same amount of features
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   as FIRACALC and CFIRSIM, and ideally a little bit more,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.120]   just so that there's also some added functionality
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.560]   to the calculator as well.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.200]   I know-- I don't think FIRACALC has been updated in some time,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.840]   but I know CFIRSIM just had a rewrite.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.920]   I'm not too sure.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.240]   I haven't had a chance to look at it too closely,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.520]   so I'm not too sure.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.080]   There may be things that are in CFIRSIM that aren't in FICALC
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.920]   and vice versa.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.720]   I'm not too sure.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.360]   But yeah, what I can do is I can speak
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.800]   to kind of what is in FICALC.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   So yeah, so a little bit of background
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.360]   on just this general kind of calculator,
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.480]   just in case there's anyone in the call who is newer
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   to this kind of calculation.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.040]   But basically, obviously, we can't know the future.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.800]   It'd be great if we could know, hey,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.440]   I've got this amount of money right now.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   I think maybe my retirement will be 30 years long.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   I'd love to know if I'll run out of money or not,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.480]   if I want to spend this much money each year.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.520]   We don't know that.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.960]   But what we do know, what we can look at, is historical data.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.680]   So we can say, hey, what if you retired in 1970
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   and had a 30-year retirement?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.920]   Would you have run out of money or not?
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.480]   Then you can say, well, what about 1971?
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.880]   You can check all of the historical data that we have.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.400]   And that's represented here in the interface
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.000]   by the number of simulations that we run.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   This is the number of times that we run a simulated--

[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   Here's an example of a reason why you might have

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   You might say, hey, why don't you

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   --retirement length, and then we'll
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   really stress test an idea.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   Maybe that would give me more confidence in my plan.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   Well, if you click Learn More, that's
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   going to open up this guide.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   And there's actually a section here
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   that kind of describes some of the problems
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   if you go with a retirement that's too short
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   or a retirement that's too long.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   So I won't get too much into the details of that right now,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   but that's just kind of like one of the benefits
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   that I think the guides provide.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   It can kind of give you some guidance
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   on some of the range of parameters
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   and a way to think about these different inputs
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   and really the effect that they can have on the algorithm that's
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   being run.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   So that's a little bit of a tangent there,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   but I'll move on and we can talk about the portfolio.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   So in FICalc, you input your initial portfolio value
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   in a dollar amount.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   And then what you get to do is you
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   get to specify the allocation that you want.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   So for instance, 80% equity, 15% bond, and 5% cash,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   that's the default.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   And then also the default is that it rebalances annually.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   Now, if you click into this, you can
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   see that there are a number of different configuration choices
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   that you can make.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   So maybe you're not interested in rebalancing.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   Maybe you just don't think that it's worth the effort
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   or you just want to see the impact of not doing
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   that work would have had historically,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   or you can turn that off.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   Or you can do something like rebalancing every five years
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   if you want.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   Another thing that you can do is you
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   can specify what's commonly called a glide path, where
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   the allocations change over time.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   So maybe at the start, you want to be pretty aggressive
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   and have this 80% equities portfolio.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   But toward the end of your retirement,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   you might not be as interested in larger swings
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   in the value of your portfolio.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   So maybe you would cut that down to 50% equities and 45% bonds.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   And then maybe you want to see the impact of that kind
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   of slow progression over time.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.320]   And then the last thing that you can change about your portfolio
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   is how quickly you reach that new value.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   So the default is that it's just evenly.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   So halfway through-- so this is a 15-year retirement.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   I'm sorry, a 30-year retirement.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   So at year 15, you're halfway to your new values.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   Well, you can change that to be instead quickly,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   which would get you there to that final value a little bit
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   quicker.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Or you could do slowly.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   So in this situation, you'd be hanging around 80-15,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   80% stocks, 15% bonds.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   You'd be hanging around that for quite a bit longer.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   And then toward the end, it would speed up
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   and kind of get you to that 50%.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   So just a few different options to kind of configure
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   how you might want your glide path to look.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   And you can see the results that that might have on the results.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   James, there's a question about breaking up the stock bond
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   value into small value sectors and things like that.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   Is it basically what you just showed us?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.320]   Yeah, let me see if I can open up the chat window just
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   so I can see that.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   OK, here we go.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   Here we go.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   Is there any ability to break into, say, US small value?
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yes.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   Great question.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   And the short answer is no, not right now.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   It's all equities.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   And it's all basically the S&P 500.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   And the reason for that is because the data source
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   that I'm using for FICALC comes from an economist
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   named Robert Shiller.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   He's a guy-- you may have heard of something called the CAPE.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   Well, he's the guy who came up with that.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   And he also publishes market data all the way back to 1871.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   Unfortunately, his stock data tracks the S&P 500.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   And if you go to his website-- and actually,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   if you click the Info button on historical data,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   that will actually include a link.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   It's his name, Robert Shiller.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   And that will take you to the data source.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   And then also on this page, he kind of
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   describes a little bit about what the data is.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   So the short answer is I would love
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.320]   to be able to split that up to have small cap, large cap,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   things like that.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   But just due to the data source that I'm using right now,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   that's not possible.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   There is another data source, and it's the one
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   that's used by the Trinity Study and Bengen's original paper.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   They both use the same data set.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   And I do think that that one breaks down things
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   in way more detail.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   But it's like $500 per year to get that data set.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   And it's just not tenable for me to put that bill.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   Bonds, great question.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   And I'll also answer the other one by Robert Strauss.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   But first, I'll do the bonds, since that's also
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   about the data source.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   So let's see here what he has about bonds,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   because I know it's listed here.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   Maybe I have-- maybe I have a description here.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   It may be tracking 10-year treasury
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   notes, but I would need to look that up.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   Unfortunately, the information on this page
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   isn't structured in a way that makes it really easy
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   to skim and get that out.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   But I'm going to say for now, I think
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   it's 10-year treasury notes.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   And then, does retirement assume starting at age 65?
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   And then, how do you set the age?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   So here's an interesting thing.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   Starting-- there's no start age in FICalc.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   It's all based on how long you think
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   your retirement might last.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   So it's based on--
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   yeah, so it's based on just how long you think
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   your retirement might last.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   So if you're 65 years old, well, maybe you
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   might think that a 30-year retirement seems appropriate.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   So you might go for 30 years here.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   If you're 50 years old, maybe you
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   might bump that up to 45 or something like that.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   So yeah, I know other calculators
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   have that start year and then maybe also
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   like an estimated age or something like that.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   But in FICalc, it's all based on that length
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   of your retirement, if that makes sense.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   I hope that answers your question, Robert.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   And thank you, Lady Geek, for posting that link
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   to the data source.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.320]   Cool.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   So unless there are any other questions
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   about the portfolio--
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   Oh, back on that age thing.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   So it really wouldn't know when RMDs might kick in, right?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Or would it?
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   Correct.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   It would not.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   That's something that you would need
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   to factor in manually through something
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   like additional income or additional withdrawals, which
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   we can talk about once we get there.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   Cool.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   So for withdrawal strategy, another thing
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   that I wanted in FICalc or something
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   that I thought could differentiate it
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   from other calculators was just adding more withdrawal
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   strategies.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   So yeah, I think there are potentially
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   more withdrawal strategies in FICalc
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   than some of the competitors.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   They might not all interest you, but they
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   might be worth checking out.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   Maybe you'll learn about the things
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   that you value in your withdrawal strategy
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   by seeing what these different strategies prioritize.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   And they might not all be familiar to you.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   So maybe sensible withdrawals, maybe that's
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   something you haven't heard of.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   Well, for each one, there is a button
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.320]   that says Learn About This Strategy.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   And if you click it, there's a little bit
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   of information describing maybe who came up
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   with this strategy, what the goal of the strategy is,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   maybe some of the math behind it,
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   the equation that it uses, and also some examples.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   And then I tried to, in the last paragraph,
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   kind of compare it maybe to a strategy
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   that you might understand and maybe mention some downfalls.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   Like for instance, sensible withdrawals
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   suffers from these high withdrawal fluctuations
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   from year to year.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   So yeah, so if a steady withdrawal amount,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   like what you might get with constant dollar
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   is important to you, then you might want
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   to consider other strategies.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:21.320]   So for each of these different strategies,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   you can then configure it based on that particular equation.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   So for instance, for constant dollar,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   you can specify how many dollars you want to withdraw each year.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   And then you can choose to adjust that for inflation or not.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   Whereas for, say, custom BPW, you
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   can adjust the PMT values that are part of custom,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.320]   part of the custom BPW algorithm.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   And yeah, so another one is Guyton-Klinger.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   So this one is the most complicated withdrawal strategy
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   that I'm aware of.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   It just has these three rules.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   They're a little bit complicated.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.320]   And it creates this larger form, but you're still
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   able to fully configure Guyton-Klinger based
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.320]   on the paper where they kind of introduced
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   and described this method.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   So one thing that may come in a future update
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   is there's a difference between the intention
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   behind these withdrawal strategies
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   and there's a difference between your ability
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   to configure things and what the creators of these strategies
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   want you to be able to do.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   So from what I could read on the Bogleheads forum,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   one of the original authors of BPW, Long Invest,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   he really did not want you to change the PMT formula
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.320]   values of BPW.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   So that's why custom BPW is separate from that,
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   because it allows you to modify those things.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   But it's different enough from BPW that it's separate.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   And another one is the endowment strategy.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   So these values here that the Yale University endowment
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   team published, there's no flexibility
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   from what I could read in adjusting these values.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   So for that reason, it's not adjustable here.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   But I'm thinking of adding a future update where
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   there would be an advanced option setting.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   And it would say, hey, adjusting these values
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   may change the behavior of this strategy in such a way
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   that it goes against the intention of the author.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   But you're allowed to do that if that's something
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   that you're comfortable doing.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   Tom, I see you noticed here that you may have noticed
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   a potential error here in the description of Vanguard
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   dynamic spending.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   I'd be curious to hear more about that
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   if you're able to elaborate.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.320]   Do you want me to comment now or wait till the end?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.320]   If you want to comment now.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.320]   I think that the 5% is if your portfolio changes.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   If your default withdrawal is 4%,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   but then your portfolio drops a lot,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   it might be that the 4% is actually
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.320]   looking like far larger percentage
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.320]   of your current portfolio balance.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   So then it caps it at only 5%.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   So it's 5% of the current amount, I thought.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   But maybe just reread their white paper on it.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   Same thing with 2.5%.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   I think if your portfolio grows rapidly,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   the current value of the portfolio--
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   because the standard withdrawal rate's
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   based on this Bingen-style approach.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   But it allows, I thought, depending on the amount
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   or depending on the current value you're spending based
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   on your current value of your portfolio.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.320]   Cool.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   That's super helpful.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   I'll have to give that another read.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   You're right.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   I'm not sure it means your program is incorrect.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   But I think at least the description may be reread it.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   Right.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Yeah, I'll have to give that another read.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   And yeah, I'll be sure to--
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   well, I don't know how I can contact you all.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   But yeah, I'll take another look at that for sure.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   Thanks for calling that out.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   So yeah, so there are a couple of different withdrawal
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   strategies there.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   And another thing that you can do
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   is specify these minimum annual withdrawals
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   and maximum annual withdrawals.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   And some of these strategies, they're
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   pretty untenable if you just don't specify
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   any mins or maxes, like percent of portfolio.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   I mean, the available spend can go down way, way low.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   If maybe you're trying to shoot for around $40,000 a year
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   and you do percent of portfolio and it only withdraws $15,000,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   that might be a pretty tough year for you.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   So this kind of allows you to say, hey, most of the time,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   hopefully that 4% hovers maybe around $40,000.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   But I can flex down to $35,000.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   And then that kind of ensures that your available spend
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   always stays at $35,000 at that minimum.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   And then you can also do it in the opposite way as well.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   You can see here with this percent of portfolio,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   shoots way up to $160,000.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   You may not need that.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   So you can kind of restrict that as well
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   and see the impact of that on the results.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   So that there is the withdrawal strategy.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   And I'll just hop on over to additional income.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   So the way additional income works is maybe you
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   might get a side job.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   And it's going to bring in $10,000 a year.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   Maybe you're expecting a raise or just an increase
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   in that amount.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   That's tracking inflation.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   So you adjust that amount for inflation.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   And maybe you're going to do that for the first 10 years.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   So that's kind of the flexibility provided
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   by this idea of additional income.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   And maybe you plan to work forever.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.320]   So you can just do income repeats indefinitely
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   if you don't want to put that end year into it.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320]   Or you might say, I'm going to take 10 years off.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   And then maybe I'll get that side job.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   And then I'll work indefinitely.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   So that's kind of what additional income allows you to do.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.320]   And if we open this up-- well, OK, we have it here.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   So this kind of shows a few of the different use cases
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   that additional income is intended to help you model.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Some of these, there may be room for a specific feature
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   to allow it to be a little bit more maybe
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   accurate or more powerful for the use case
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   that you have in mind.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.320]   But for now, it all needs to be entered as additional income.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   So one example is rental property cash flow.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   If you have a pension, Social Security, part-time job,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   private inheritance, any of those things
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   that you might get as money for a given year,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   is this where dividend income would be entered as well?
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   Dividend income is factored in through these assets
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   that you get here.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   So you would not need to do a separate dividend income
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   as additional income.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   This would be-- these are mainly just--
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   these are all things that are separate from the portfolio
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   that's defined above, if that makes sense, Greg.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   Cool.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   So there are things that I would like
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   to add to additional income based on feedback
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   people have messaged me.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   So I know that it's not the--
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   I know that it doesn't support all of the features
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   that everyone needs for everything, but it's a start.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   And the way that additional income works
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   is it reduces the withdrawal that you actually make.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   So one thing that's a more complicated idea in FICalc
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   is this difference between the target spend that you have
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   and the actual withdrawal that you make.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   So just to show an example, if we go over to constant dollar
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   and we do $40,000 per year and we adjust it for inflation
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   and we add in a job and that gives us $40,000
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   and we adjust it for inflation, it starts immediately
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   and it goes forever.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   We will never actually withdraw from our investments
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   because this additional income that we've got
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   has fully covers the amount that the equation determined
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   that we should withdraw, if that makes sense.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   And if this were, say, $20,000, then we
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   would spend that money that year and then
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   we would withdraw the remainder, which would be $20,000,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   as determined from the constant dollar strategy.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   Now, if you pull in $60,000 a year,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   you're going to take that first $40,000
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   and this calculator assumes that you spend all of that $40,000
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   that the withdrawal strategy calculates,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   but then that additional $20,000, that gets then
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   reinvested into your portfolio.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   I assume everything is in after-tax dollars.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   For additional income, yes, you would definitely
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   want to be doing after-tax dollars for this.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   So I'll move on to additional withdrawals.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   And so, yeah, so sometimes you might
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.320]   know that you're spending $40,000 a year,
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   but also you know that you need a car.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   And maybe you want to factor in buying a new car or a used car
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   every 10 years or something like that.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   Or maybe you're saving up for someone's college
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   or just other things that might come up
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   that you need to factor in.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   Well, you can do that through additional withdrawals.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.320]   So you could do college, and you could say,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   OK, we're going to spend up to $30,000.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   We'll adjust that for inflation.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   That's going to happen in four years.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   And it's going to start in 10 years,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   and it's going to repeat for four years.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   So that's the additional withdrawal.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.320]   And the way that that works is that this
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   is just tacked on top of whatever the withdrawal
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   strategy calculates.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   So if the withdrawal strategy calculates $40,000,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   then when this year occurs, that's
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   going to be a $70,000 withdrawal.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   And then Rob says, when you say after-tax,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   anything to deal with Roth versus taxable versus tax
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   deferred.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   So for additional income, these are just
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   kind of assuming that they're just
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   dollars that you're receiving.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   They would be after-tax dollars.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   There's not really any way to specify things
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   like a Roth or taxable or tax deferred for FICAL.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   It doesn't get into the details of the specifics
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   of where your money is.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   For instance, just looking at the portfolio,
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   it's just equities, bonds, and cash.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.320]   This isn't saying half of this is in a tax-deferred account
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   and the other half is taxable.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   It's not getting into that level of detail.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   It really does track kind of the math
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   that Fangan and the Trinity study used,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   which to my knowledge don't make that distinction
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   between where the accounts are.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   But that'd be a great feature to add for sure down the road.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   And then CS69 says, how can everything
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   be an after-tax value if you don't specify
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   the type of account the assets are in?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Well, I hope what I just said kind of matches that.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Again, if you're familiar with the Fangan study,
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   the Trinity study, the way that this calculator works
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   is very similar to that.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   It does just add a few additional ideas
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   like additional income and additional withdrawal
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   that those studies didn't factor in.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   But it's still kind of the same idea though.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   So the returns on equity, bonds, and cash are pre-tax returns.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   The cash withdrawals are after-tax.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   Correct.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   So taxes are currently not taken into account
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   when it's calculating things like returns and growth
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   and things like that.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   And that is something that people have asked.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   And then cash withdrawals are after-tax.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   Do you mean additional withdrawals here, Bradcom?
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   Yes.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Correct.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   That would be after-tax.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   Cool.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   So moving on down to historical data,
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.320]   the full data set goes back to 1871.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   But you might want to restrict your data
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   for different reasons.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   So for example, one reason that you might want to
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   is that the S&P 500 didn't exist before 1926.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.320]   So if you look, Robert Schiller describes
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   how he creates this data for 1871 through 1926.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   You might read that and say, hey,
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   that sounds kind of weird to me.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   I don't want to trust that.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   I don't want to include that data.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   Also, Bengen's analysis and the Trinity study
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   limited their data set using 1926 as the start date
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   because they didn't do any of that sort of computation
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   that Schiller did to create that earlier data set.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   So that's one reason why you might want to limit your data.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   And that's also why the default value that the data is
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   limited to is 1926 for that reason.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   So that's just another configuration option
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   provided by the calculator.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   And then for user preferences, two little quick things
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   that I just mentioned.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   If you look, there's a little bit of motion
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   when these pop-ups appear.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   And you might not like that.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.320]   Well, if you turn this off, then it's
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   going to get rid of that so that it's a little bit less annoying.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   And also, if you're colorblind, you
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   can choose one of these options.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   And it might make some of these charts
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   over here look a little bit--
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   be a little bit more easy to read.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   So definitely worth checking those out
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   if either of those things appeal to you.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   So just thought I'd mention that.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   So that's kind of like all the configuration stuff.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   And I'm going to hop on over to the questions.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   Tom Pruess, "I thought the Bengen study assumed
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   you paid your taxes with the money you withdrew.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   That is, the withdrawals were pre-taxed.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   Can anyone confirm?"
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   So Tom, just to clarify, that is my understanding as well.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   And that is how this calculator works as well.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   So if you're withdrawing $40,000 a year here,
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   you're going to get a tax bill.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   FICALC does not include that tax bill into this.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   So you would need to include that into your spending,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   if that makes sense.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   And then Lady Geek, "What statistical distribution
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   do you use to stimulate over that data?"
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   Are you referring to these charts here or something else?
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   Lady Geek?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   Yeah, I was just trying to understand--
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   you know, when you get those nice charts there,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   there's an underlying--
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.320]   you know, when you're making 121 runs, what are you varying
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   and by how much?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   That's where the magic goes.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   Everybody calls it a Monte Carlo.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   Monte Carlo is just another name for running
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   statistical distribution.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.320]   But nobody really describes the underlying models
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   or the distributions used to create those curves.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   So just a little interest in the model itself.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   Yeah, so I can--
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   I'm going to--
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   I think I'll answer that as I describe
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   what is in these results.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   So how about I start describing the results?
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   And then once we--
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   let me say, like, describe--
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   like, get down to this chart and describe it.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   And then let me know if you still have questions.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   How does that sound?
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   OK, cool.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   So one thing-- you know, if you read the Bingen study,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   if you read the Trinity study, they
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   talk a lot about this idea of success rates.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   Well, if you click this--
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   you know, what is a success rate?
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   What does it mean to be successful or not?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   Well, if you click this, you can see
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.320]   what the definition is of success for the strategy
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.320]   that you've chosen.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   So for a category of withdrawal strategies
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   that I call longevity, success is
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   defined as the portfolio never running out of money.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   So in the Bingen study, if on that 30th year,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   the portfolio had $1 left, Bingen
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   would say that that's a success.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   Now, you might disagree.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   But that's the definition that Bingen used.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   And that's also the definition used here
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   in this success rate number.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Now, that doesn't tell the full story.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   And that's why I introduced these two other values that
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   might be of interest to people.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   So the first is this idea called nearly failed.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   So if you click that, you can see what that means.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   That means that the end portfolio value
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   is less than 35% of the initial portfolio value.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   Now, the reason I added that is because, you know,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   if I was, you know, toward the end of my retirement
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   and my portfolio value was down, was
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   almost a third of what I started with,
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   I might be a little bit concerned.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   So that's why I added that there.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   Because I think that's a piece of information
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   that people would find meaningful.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   But that was not captured in those studies.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   And we're seeing here that it's 0%.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   And that's because I added some of these additional incomes.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   So I'm actually going to refresh the page
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   to wipe all that data out.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   And you can see here that with this sort of default $1 million
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   portfolio with this $40,000 strategy,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   we're getting 5% of these simulations
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   as being nearly failed.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   And then another thing that, you know,
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   people are interested in are this idea of a large portfolio
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   where in FI Calc, that's defined as the end portfolio being 300--
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   sorry, 300% larger than the initial portfolio value.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   So some people, you know, they want
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   to maximize how much they spend in their life.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   They don't want to have lots and lots of money left over.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   So you can actually see with the constant dollar strategy,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   you get a third of your simulations
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   with this large end portfolio.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.320]   Now, if you go down to something like the endowment strategy,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   you're going to see here that it does
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   a little bit of a better job at, you know,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   not getting to that nearly failed state
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   or to that large end portfolio state.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   So that might be something that might be interesting.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.320]   All right, percent of portfolio.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   All right, cool.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   So why does percent of portfolio use longevity?
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   It seems it should never be able to run out of money.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   So I'm going to answer that.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   But first, let me get into a strategy that is not longevity.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   So an example is VPW.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   So if you think about it, so one of the qualities of VPW
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   is that in the final year, your portfolio is $0, right?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   So if you look here at this chart, it's $0.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   That is by definition.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   That is the goal of the strategy.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   And all three of the strategies in this maximized spend bucket
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   have that in common.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   So if you use that Bengen or Trinity study definition
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.320]   of success, then you're always going
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   to get a 0% success rate.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   So instead, the success is defined
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   as when two things are met.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   One is that the portfolio is exhausted.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   And the final year withdrawal is greater
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   than or equal to your minimum specified withdrawal.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   So if you say that you always want
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   to be able to withdraw $20,000 and you specify VPW,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   and on that final year, you're only able to withdraw $15,000,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   that's considered a fail for VPW.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   So it's a little bit of a different definition.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   It's unique to FICalc.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   You may disagree with that.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   You might agree with it.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   Definitely open to feedback about that.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   And then for percent of portfolio--
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   OK, so why is this one measured as longevity?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   It seems it should never be able to run out of money.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   Well, the strategies that tend to not run out of money
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   are ones that are good fit for longevity.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   The point of longevity is that it shouldn't run out of money.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   So if you devise an algorithm that literally can never
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   run out of money, it's still good to evaluate it
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   as a longevity one.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.320]   Because the alternative is, which is the maximized spend,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   what they have in common is that that final year always
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320]   drops you to $0.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   Percent of portfolio doesn't have that quality,
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   so that's why it's longevity.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   I hope that makes sense, David, but I'm definitely
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   open to hearing alternative perspectives on that.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   So moving on down, there's a little bit of analysis that--
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.320]   oh, well, actually, one thing I want to say.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   An additional-- something I'd like to add in the future
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   to FICalc would be the ability to adjust these values.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   You might say less than 35%.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.320]   I'd be pretty worried if it was less than 45% or 50%.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.320]   Well, I think users should be able to configure that.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.320]   Or you might say--
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   David, you might say, this is a bad definition of success
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   for percent of portfolio.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   Well, you should be able to modify that.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   So that's a feature that I'd like to add.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   I don't have it yet.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   And then also the ability to add additional analysis
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   blocks that might be something that appeal to you.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   So kind of beginning to blur the line a little bit
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.320]   between this calculator app, which
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   has more restricted functionality,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   and a spreadsheet app, which would really
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   give you kind of limitless flexibility with how
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   you modify that data.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   And on that note, I will mention that you
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   can download all the data in FICalc as a CSV
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   and then load that into a spreadsheet app
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.320]   if you want to do your own analysis.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   So you can do that.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   Cool.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   So portfolio at the end of the retirement,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   this just tracks information about that final portfolio
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   value.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   So one thing I would like to add would be a way to specify,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   say, what's the portfolio like at year 5?
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   What about year 10?
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   What about halfway through?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320]   I don't have that yet.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   You can only look at the final year.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   But I think it'd be pretty cool if you could also
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   specify kind of like the time scale that you'd like to see.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   If you click these three blocks over here,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   you can actually see a sorted list
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   of all of the in-portfolio values.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   If you click Largest, then they'll
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   be sorted biggest to small.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   If you click Smallest, they'll be sorted smallest to large.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   And then if you click $0 Portfolios,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   it's going to show-- oh, whoa.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   We've got a bug here.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Well, I'll have to fix that bug.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   It's not showing the $0 ones.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   But it should be showing the $0 ones.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   So yeah.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   And then here we go.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   We got these charts.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   So this chart is meant to show the quantiles of the data.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   So it's supposed to show the median value.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   It's then supposed to show the values that
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   are within 50% of that median.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   So 25% larger, 25% smaller.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   And then the 90% quantile, and then the 100% as well.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.320]   And then it also shows the initial portfolio value.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   So you can kind of see about where these values sit.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   So one thing to keep in mind is that these charts,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   they're kind of a V1 version of the chart.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   The mode should actually be what's at the peak.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   But right now, it's the median.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   So that's just something to keep in mind
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   is that the actual distribution curve would
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   look a little bit different.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   It's more meant to communicate the idea.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   OK, cool.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   So we have a question from Mosh.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   And I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   Constant dollar minus minus dollars, additional income,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   plus dollars.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   So the net result is what the calculator uses
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   is a portfolio withdrawal.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   Assuming constant dollar is greater
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   than additional income plus portfolio return.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   Just give me one second.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   I'm going to read that again to make sure I understand it
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.320]   before I respond.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   Mosh, I'm going to ask maybe if you could elaborate a bit more
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   on that final paragraph.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   I'd be happy to answer it.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   But I'm having trouble following along
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   with what you're asking there.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   I totally understand.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   Hopefully you can hear me.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   I can hear you, yeah.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   Awesome.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   Thanks, James.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   Terrific looking tool.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   So what I think I'm asking, and I think you've confirmed it,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   but I wanted to just be sure.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   Because if I'm not sure, I suspect other people
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   aren't sure as well.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   When we're looking at the calculator,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   you have a constant dollar withdrawal.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   Let's say, for the sake of discussion, $40,000.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   That's where you start as your default.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   Let's say at some point, 10 years--
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   so I retire early.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   And after 10 years, I get Social Security.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   And let's say my Social Security is, let's say, $20,000.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   So obviously, the net of those two numbers is $20,000.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   So logic would tell me that that $20,000
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   should come out of the portfolio, not the $40,000.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   And I just wanted to verify that that's
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   obviously plus any portfolio return.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   So that's all I was trying to say
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   in that kind of convoluted last paragraph.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   So is that accurate what I said?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   That's accurate.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   And thank you so much for explaining that.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   Yes, that is an accurate description
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   of what happens in this calculator.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   That's what I assumed.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   And I appreciate that, James.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   Assuming if I download the CSV file,
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   I can then look at that and actually see it in the data,
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   see it behaving that way.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.320]   You should be able to, yeah.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   And I think once we click into some of these years,
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.320]   we can see that as well.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   And on that note, that kind of is a good segue down here
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   into this available spend.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   So this is called available spend and not withdrawal amount.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   So although constant dollar is saying--
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   people talk a lot about withdrawing.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   This is saying that you have that $40,000 a year.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   It is not saying that you actually
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   withdrew $40,000 that year.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.320]   So that's an interesting thing, right?
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   Because this withdrawal strategy is
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   a little bit different from maybe
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.320]   what you would want to spend.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   But it does actually determine, based
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   on your additional income, what you actually
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   do have available to spend.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.320]   And what you can kind of see here
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   is that these charts aren't optimized
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   for every single use case.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   So it's kind of weird.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   It's like this straight line.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   But this is kind of how it renders when--
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   well, look at that.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   It says average initial withdrawal amount.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.320]   I need to update that label there to say average spend
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   amount.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   So yeah, because it's saying all withdrawals are $40,000.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   But it's actually all available spend is $40,000.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.320]   And then if we even turn this off for a minute,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   you can see, again, this is another example
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   where the chart hasn't been optimized for every use case
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   or just kind of every situation that you
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   might find yourself in.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   And the reason that this chart is displaying this way
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   is because you're pretty much always withdrawing $40,000
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   unless you run out of money.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   And then you withdraw $0.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   So yeah.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.320]   OK, cool.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   So I'll move on down to simulations by star year.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.320]   So this is another kind of distinguishing feature
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   that I wanted to include in FICalc, which was the ability
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   to really drill down into a particular year
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   and see information about that year.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   So just at a high level, there are
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   three color-coded values for each year.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.320]   A red year, that means it ran out of money entirely.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   These yellow years or orange years,
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   that means it almost ran out of money.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   It's less than about a third.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   And then these blue years, that's
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   when you end with a lot of money with that over 300%
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   of the initial portfolio.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   So just kind of at a glance, you can kind of see, OK,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   look at that.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   The '60s, start of the '70s, that was a rough time.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.320]   Maybe around the turn of the century,
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   that was also a bit of a rough time.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   And then you can kind of see that there
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   were these more booming times in between those.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   And then when you say ran out of money,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.320]   you mean according to the planning available amount
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   for that year, agree?
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.320]   What I mean is that if you say--
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   I mean, really what I mean is when you say ran out of money,
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.320]   it means the end result is that you
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   have $0 in that portfolio.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   So if I click into one of these and I
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.320]   look at this portfolio value, boom.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   We hit $0 in 1990, several years before the portfolio ended.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.320]   So that means that any red means that there's
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   $0 in that portfolio, either on a final year
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   or in any year during the retirement, really.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   And then are those end portfolio numbers
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   considered in constant or inflation-adjusted dollars?
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   Every dollar that you see on this page is in first-year dollars.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:23.320]   And actually, if you just give me one sec, I will show you.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   So if you come to this page and it's your first time
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.320]   visiting the page, you'll see this message here
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   that kind of explains that CS69.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   So all dollar amounts displayed have
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.320]   been adjusted for inflation to be in first-year dollars.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   So I hope that's clear enough to help
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.320]   kind of allow you to kind of understand
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   what's on the page here.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   All right, so what I'll do is I'll hop on in.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   I'm actually going to turn back on that.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   OK, I must have deleted it.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   But I'm going to turn on that Social Security for $20,000
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   starting 10 years in, lasts forever,
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   adjusting it for inflation.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   So I'm going to turn that on, and we're just
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.320]   going to hop on in here.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   So you can see that has a pretty cool result
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   on our retirement here.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   And what I'll do is I'll hop into 1972,
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   and we'll see what happens.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   So what you can do is you can see portfolio information
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   about this particular retirement from 1972 to 2002.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   So you can see the median, average, standard deviation,
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   largest, smallest down here, final value.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   So you kind of get this information.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.320]   And then you can kind of also just visually see
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   how that portfolio changed over time.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.320]   And then also, if you come down here,
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   you can see the same thing for that available spend.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   And you can see that it's always showing $40,000.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   So I think one of the highest impact features
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   I could update to FICALP would be showing the withdrawal
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   that you made on the same chart as the available spend.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   I think it'd be pretty cool to see that you're actually
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.320]   withdrawing $40,000 for these first 10 years.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   And then when Social Security kicks in,
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   that would show you drop that down to $20,000.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   And then you would kind of see that $20,000 a year withdrawal.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   You can't see that right now.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:21.320]   You do have to download the CSV and dig into that.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   And then, so you're just using the X year blocks.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   Is there any option to randomly change the sequence of returns?
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Great question, Rob.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   In the works, not done yet.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   So I actually have it pretty much working.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   But the problem is that right now,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   it can run 120 SIMs pretty quickly in the browser.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   But I had it run like 100,000 or like 250,000
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   to try to be a legitimate Monte Carlo simulator
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   and a competitor to some of the other ones that are out there.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   But right now, the algorithm is too slow
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   to do all of that in the browser.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   So I either need to improve the efficiency of the algorithm
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   or move it to the server.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   And on that note, one thing I'd like to mention
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   is I care a lot about privacy.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   FICalc doesn't store any of your data anywhere.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   No information that you type into this calculator
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   leaves your device.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   I don't ever want that to change.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   And also, if you click Privacy, you can kind of
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:34.320]   see our privacy policy, which is we don't store your data.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.320]   We don't sell your data.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   That's not what FICalc is about.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   I do have Google Analytics on the site.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   And that's because I just like to see who's using it
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   and things like that and where they're using it from.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   I'd love to move off Google, honestly,
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   and maybe go with a more privacy-focused alternative.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   But it's just a time commitment.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   And I think that it would also cost me a little bit of money.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   So I just haven't been able to justify that.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   And then on that note, there is actually a single ad.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   And FICalc-- I'll show you it right now.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   Here it is.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.320]   I hate this ad.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   I'll probably remove it.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   But I was just trying to think of ways to justify it.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   There are a lot of features that I'd
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   like to add to this calculator.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.320]   But it's really hard to justify spending potentially
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   hundreds of hours when I'm doing the big-time investment.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   It's not currently earning me any money.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   Cool.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   Talk about the programming tool.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   Yeah, it's built in a framework called--
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   well, so the programming language that I'm using
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.320]   are HTML and CSS, which you have to use for the web,
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   and JavaScript, which I use for some
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   of the interactive behaviors.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   And then within JavaScript, there's
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   a framework called React that makes it a little bit easier
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   to build interactive web applications like FICalc.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.320]   So FICalc is a React front-end application.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.320]   And other than that, kind of everything that you see
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   is custom.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   So that's pretty much the TLDR of the tech stack there.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   And I'm trying to think of what else.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   You know, I actually want to head back a little bit
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   and go back to a question that Lady Geek asked a little bit ago
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   about the statistical distribution.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   I'm curious if that question has been answered, Lady Geek,
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   or if you still have an open question about that.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   Yeah, it's more of a fundamental question.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   Like, you run 121 simulations.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   Simulation number one, you get a data point.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   What do you vary on simulation number two?
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   What parameters are varied?
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   And that's where I'm trying to understand the statistics.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.320]   What parameters are you varying in with what distribution?
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   I guess it's just more of a curiosity than anything.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   That makes sense.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:17.320]   Yeah, so this is not a Monte Carlo simulator
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   that has things like small perturbations on data.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   It's using Schiller's dataset, unmodified.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.320]   Simulation one starts at 1871.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   Simulation two starts at 1872.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   That's the only difference between the first sim
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   and the second sim.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   So there are 121 sims being run here
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.320]   because that's how many 30-year intervals there are
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   between 1871 and 2020.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   And Tom mentioned a good point that if you
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   change the number of years, you'll
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   get more or less simulation.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   So if I bump this up to, say, 120,
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   you can see only 31 sims are run.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   Whereas if I knock this down to five,
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   we're going to see 146 because there are just
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   more five-year intervals that fit in the dataset.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   So it's more like a sliding window?
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.320]   Yeah, I think sliding window is an accurate way to describe it.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   That's why I ask very basic questions.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.320]   Well, I learn a lot, certainly.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   But because it's also a use of terminology,
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   because when you say Monte Carlo, I'm thinking normal,
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   log normal, all the classical.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   But now you're talking about variation
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   of the actual dataset in time where
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.320]   your start and end points are.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   So I think that's a different perspective
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   of what people are assuming, well, me,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.320]   of the underlying mechanics here.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   That makes sense.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.320]   Yeah, and there's a lot of proprietary information
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   on the-- no, the commercial tools, everybody kind of
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.320]   hides exactly how they do it, and they all claim accuracy.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.320]   And this is very open, very clear.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   So that's good.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   So one thing that you might be interested in
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   is there's a section in the guides called How It Works.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   And it really is intended to be a very clear description
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   of everything that happens.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   So you can even go on to what happens in one simulation year
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   So that might also interest you.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   So definitely check that out as well.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   Yeah, because the other nice thing I heard that--
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   let's say I'm very--
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   I'm an engineer, but very detailed
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   on getting the basics right, especially
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   when I did a lot of things for the wiki.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   Terminology is so important.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   Because as soon as you said everything
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.320]   is brought back to year one dollars,
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.320]   it made perfect sense.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   Because in finance, that's the main difference
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   between-- actually, between engineers and finance people.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   As engineers think forward in time,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   finance brings everything backward in time.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   So that's why they talk about net present value.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   You talk-- you reference things in the present time.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   And that's just a different mindset than engineers.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   I think of things about 20 years out
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   and how is my product going to work.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   And of course, I have perfect data.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   But so they say that it's a matter
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.320]   of defining the basics fundamentals.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.320]   I see you threw a few equations in your explanations,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   which is good.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   So thank you.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   I'm 100% in agreement about the importance
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   of making sure that the terminology is--
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   that the correct terminology is used
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   and that the explanation of what's going on
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   is as clear as possible.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   I would love for FICalc to be completely transparent.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   It may not be there yet.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   But if anyone sees something that seems
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   like an unanswered question, just let me know.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   And I would absolutely add something
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   to the guide that explains that.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   And I see here we have a question from Jaina or Jana.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   Sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   But it's just asking a little bit about my background.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   Yeah, I'd love to share that.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   So I'm kind of a hybrid role, designer, engineer.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   I work at Netflix.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   I've been interested in fire and that kind of thing
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   for a little over 10 years now, I guess.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   And yeah, I've just kind of always thought
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   how it would be pretty cool to give back to the community.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   I've learned so much from blogs, from forums,
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   just from all the resources and tools people have made.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.320]   So I just always thought it'd be really cool
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   if I was able to build something that people found valuable.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.320]   So that kind of motivated me to put FICalc together.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   I hope at least some people find it useful.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:55.320]   Yeah, so that's a little bit about me, I guess.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   Barnes is asking, FICalc uses first year dollars.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   So after, say, 10 years, I'll be removing $40,000
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   plus whatever inflation was over the intervening 10 years, correct?
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   It's a great question, Barnes.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   And let me try to clarify.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   Every dollar that's displayed on this results page
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   will be adjusted for inflation to be in first year dollars.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   But that does not mean that the underlying calculation
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   is keeping everything in first year dollars.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   So your question about it would be removing
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   $40,000 plus whatever inflation was,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   that's something that you specify at the withdrawal strategy level.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   So for constant dollar, you specify that you want $40,000 per year.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:48.320]   And then you specify, I do want to adjust this amount for inflation.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   Now, because that is specified,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   that's why when we come down here and we see this available spend,
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   we see that everything's $40,000,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   because you specified in the withdrawal strategy
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   that it's going to adjust for inflation.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.320]   So over time, it's actually increasing
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   that amount that you're withdrawing each year,
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   the actual number of dollars.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.320]   And then when we actually display the results,
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.320]   we show it in current year dollars,
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   because I think that that's a little bit easier
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   for you and just users and myself to kind of evaluate that.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.320]   Now, if we turn this off, we can kind of see
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.320]   things are going to start going crazy
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   because we're no longer adjusting it for inflation.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   So in first year dollars, it's really going to track inflation.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   And we're going to see a more variation
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.320]   in actual purchasing power that you have.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   And then Rob says, what inflation projection do you use?
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   So this is using the CPI data from Robert Schiller.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   And I think it's -- I'm not sure.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.320]   I know there are different kinds of CPI,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   so it looks like he says consumer price,
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   all urban consumers.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   That may be the one he's using.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   You definitely want to give this paragraph a read
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   just to make sure that that is the actual one.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   But yeah, it's CPI, U.S. based,
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   and potentially the all urban consumers CPI value.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   Okay, cool.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   So we have another question from David.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   I think there are two basic categories of SEMs,
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   historical, aka backtesting, and Monte Carlo.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   Cool.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   Yeah, David, that lines up with kind of my understanding as well.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   I think there's value in both.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   I definitely appreciate the backtesting approach,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   and I also like the Monte Carlo approach,
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   as you've described it.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   I did start work on a Monte Carlo version of FICalc.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   It's not done yet, but, you know,
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.320]   people have expressed to me that they find value in that as well,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   and I think it would be pretty cool if that were an option available.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   So I'm trying to think if there's anything else worth touching on.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   I think one thing I want to mention again is, like,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   this thing works great on your phone,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.320]   and most users of the app do browse it on their phones.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   So definitely, you know, if you have a phone, you know,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   check it out.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   If you're just at the grocery store and just wanted to run a quick
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   calculation, perhaps add the word "backtest simulation" and footnote it.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   It's a great point.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   I definitely agree.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   Maybe adding the word "backtesting" or "historical" or something like that
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.320]   right here on the calculator could make that a little bit more clear.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   Plus one to that.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:43.320]   Thank you.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   You know, I'm going to just hop into the guides real fast just to see if
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   anything comes to mind that we might want to call out.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.320]   So this -- I will call out one thing.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   So when you click "learn about this strategy,"
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320]   you're going to get this description here.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   Well, if you go into the guides, there's another page.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   There's another section for the withdrawal strategies,
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320]   and right now they don't link up.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   So there's a separate description of Bettenklinger here than there is in the
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   calculator.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   And you might be thinking, "What the heck?
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.320]   Why would you do that?
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   Why not just have one?"
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   I definitely want one.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320]   I'm just not there yet.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   I plan to really -- the goal was to really go really detailed here on the
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   guides.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   And they are a little bit more detailed than what's in the actual
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.320]   calculator.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   For instance, it has this, like,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   strengths and weaknesses section for each of the strategies.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   And, again, that's based on my opinion.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   So you might have a different opinion, which is fine.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   But if you do, I'd love if you shot me an e-mail,
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   because I'd love to hear more about it.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.320]   And then, yeah, I guess one other thing I want to mention is,
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   if you want to save a calculation -- so here we go.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   We've got this Guyton-Klinger calculation.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   Let's do a 35-year retirement.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   And let's rebalance every five years.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   You can hit save.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   You can -- there's this button over here, save or share.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   And it gives you this URL.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   And if you copy that URL, you can then paste it into a new tab,
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.320]   and that's going to load that back up.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]   So as you can see, we've got Guyton-Klinger here.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.320]   We've got that five-year rebalance, and we've got that 35 years.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   So that's kind of how you can share a calculation,
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   if you want to send it to a friend or family member.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320]   And then you can also bookmark that,
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.320]   and that's kind of how saving your calculations works as well.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320]   And then just briefly, a few, like,
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   high-impact things that I think could be interesting to add.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   One would be this idea called similar results.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   So what if you run this calculation for 35 years and $1 million?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   Well, what if, when you scroll down to the bottom here, it said,
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   well, what would the results be if you had done 40 years and $1.1 million?
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   And just kind of a brief summary of that.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.320]   And then there would be a link, and you could click in,
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   and you could kind of view that.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.320]   So that would just be a way to kind of get a quick glance at some minor tweaks
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   that might interest you.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   And then another one would be a way to set up two calculations side-by-side
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   and kind of do a side-by-side comparison.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   Right now you can do it by having two browser windows side-by-side,
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   but some people expressed to me that they would find value
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   in there being just one in the -- just one in the app.
