[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   You want to see something?
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   Look at my eyes.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.240]   Look at his eyes.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's fucking contagion over here.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.520]   Broski, what happened?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.600]   You have conjunctivitis.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.440]   Yeah. Double I got it from my
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.040]   daughter. He got something in his
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.960]   eye. And then I got this like
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.480]   fucking allergic reaction to it.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.080]   It is. I'm just messed up, dude,
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.180]   for two days now. I haven't been
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.720]   able to see.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.960]   OK, well, let me tell you about
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   this weekend, which was
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.400]   the most motherfucking exhausting
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200]   weekend of my life.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.100]   I mean, where do I even
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.320]   start? OK, here's here's where I
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.360]   start. So I fucking fly home
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.320]   for mentally from Italy.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.920]   Get back in the air and thirty
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   five thousand feet.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520]   I decide to troll the mids.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.900]   Oh no. We'll talk about that
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.660]   later. But anyways, I'm sitting
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.200]   a beautifully chilled white
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.860]   burgundy by trolling the mids.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.480]   You mean that you were occupying
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.560]   their airspace,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.200]   flying at the level of commercial
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.420]   jets to fly by.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.700]   It's a forty five thousand feet.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.160]   I said a forty five thousand feet.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860]   I went down where the public
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.120]   airlines fly. And I was like,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.020]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.320]   Made me came back.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   Let your winners ride
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.960]   Rain Man, David Sack.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.480]   And it's said we open sources
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.000]   to the fans and they've just gone
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   crazy.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.800]   We know.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.740]   I land in L.A.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.040]   and I go straight
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.380]   house.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.900]   I land it like, you know, I get
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.480]   there like one thirty or two thirty
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.340]   or something, three o'clock,
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.780]   something on there in the morning.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.300]   I take it in the afternoon, take an
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.180]   ice bath and boom, we start
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.300]   playing at four o'clock.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.480]   OK, we start playing for this.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.360]   That is not a big deal.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.560]   It's like one day of poker.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.320]   We play poker.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.720]   We finish at like three or four in
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   the morning. We're exhausted.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.360]   Kevin shows up in a wheelchair
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120]   because he had pulled his
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400]   fucking abdomen.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.380]   Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart in a race
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.000]   with Stephen Ridley hit a 40 yard
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   dash with Stephen
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.760]   pulled off his muscles like
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   I think you need a 40 inch
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.800]   dash if it was Kevin Hart.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.160]   That's a 40 inch dash.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.800]   Anyways, Kev, Kev pulls all these
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.480]   muscles, more legs, door in the car
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.760]   opens and wheelchair
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.560]   comes, wheels himself
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   to the table.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.160]   And so that was the beginning.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.540]   I was like, this is like this is an
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.680]   odd way to start poker.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.540]   We play till four in the morning,
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.460]   go to bed, wake
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.120]   up, do our thing,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.100]   start the game again Thursday at
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   four.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.460]   OK, we play again
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.540]   till fucking three or four in the
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.540]   morning.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.560]   Wake up, we go to Burbank at 10 and
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.780]   we fly to Porto Vallarta for
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.620]   bachelor party. It's unbelievable.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500]   OK, 10 bedrooms, huge
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.180]   compound on the beach, the whole
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.180]   nine yards.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.360]   We start gambling on the plane.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.940]   I just want you guys to know that we
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.800]   slept nine hours and four days
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.320]   and we just kept playing and playing
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   and playing at one point said,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.440]   and this is exactly how the
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.180]   interaction with said, hey,
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.780]   guys, maybe we should go to the
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.280]   St. Regis for it.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.720]   And then as soon as he's about to say
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.460]   dinner, I was like, shut up, keep
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.480]   playing.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.200]   The point is that we played
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.680]   from the plane in
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   the car, we played on an app,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.440]   then we played in the house.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   The food was served buffet style.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.840]   It all decorum just
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.520]   went away. We didn't do anything.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.760]   We didn't leave that house.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.800]   We didn't walk on the beach.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.200]   We didn't fucking nothing.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.180]   You didn't put your feet in the
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.940]   ocean.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.940]   I played until
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.840]   I landed in Moffitt on
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   Monday afternoon.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.160]   Can you fucking believe it?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.400]   It's so it's like almost like, you
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.180]   know, six days straight of
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.240]   poker. I will say this.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's an incredible house.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.160]   The food was incredible.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.700]   I really wish I could have seen more
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.280]   than my bedroom and the poker table.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.680]   I wish I could tell you that the
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   Pacific Ocean was nice.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.720]   I have no fucking idea.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.880]   You put in a bucket.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.960]   You can even see the bathrooms in
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.960]   this house.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.200]   No, I had the doors open
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.740]   so that I could run to my room and
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.560]   pee and come back.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.160]   I mean, it was a waste time.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   You know, it was the most D.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.980]   Jen weekend I've ever been a part
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.640]   of. And then all of us, by the way,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   we're so exhausted.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.680]   We slept for fucking 10 hours a day
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.940]   for the like the last three days.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.920]   Oh, and by the way, so smart.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.080]   You know, you think it's a bachelor
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.240]   party. It's like there'll be girls
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.160]   or nothing.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.560]   Not even the housekeepers were
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.960]   women. Everybody was mad.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.240]   No distractions.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.280]   Literally no distraction.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.480]   It's just all dudes, dudes, cleaning
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.960]   the house, dudes cooking, dudes,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.200]   dudes doing this, dudes.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.740]   Our one attempt to go off site to
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.160]   go to a dinner was like, no,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.320]   sit down.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   The best. He's the best.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.700]   That should pay for some tequila
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.600]   research.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.460]   He's the best.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.280]   My Lord. I just want to I don't
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.240]   want to make this into tequila
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.480]   part two, but my email is filled
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.040]   with 8000 word tequila
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.800]   missives and overviews from
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.260]   Friedberg and every tequila
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.280]   producer in the world.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   And my Twitter, my
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.200]   axe is filled with posts
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.680]   about Chabot's man in the arena
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.920]   comments. They have set off
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.120]   an absolute fury
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160]   as Chamath was alluding
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.880]   to. So the man in the arena tweet.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.960]   I don't know the timestamp here.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.920]   It looks like 1022 a.m.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.880]   I don't know what that is.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.560]   Italian time. But Chamath decided
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.840]   to say, I'm in the arena trying
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.040]   stuff. Some will work, some
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   wound, but always learning.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.040]   You're anonymous and afraid of
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.200]   your own shadow. Enjoy the
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.160]   sidelines. And this, of course,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.640]   was to somebody who is
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.400]   criticizing a SPAC or
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.840]   something. And I think this
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280]   person had eight followers.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.800]   And let's just go through the
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.440]   memes here. Here, somebody with
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.200]   the AI revolution has made a
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.160]   Chamath version of Gladiator,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   who is Russell Crowe and
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.000]   Chamath's DNA being mixed.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.360]   Friedberg, I didn't know this
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.200]   was possible in DNA today, but
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   I guess there is a new
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.960]   actor storming Hollywood and
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.800]   it's Chamath Crowe. It's
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.920]   Russell Polly hoppity. Beautiful.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.320]   I mean, what a great job that
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.840]   is. It looks like you. So great
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   job to whatever mids did that
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.080]   in whatever mid software.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   Do you want to actually talk
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.120]   about the man in the arena
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.760]   comment and what the context of
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.200]   it is? Can we talk about that?
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.560]   Actually? Yeah, I think people
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.400]   got upset because what I said
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.920]   was the truth. And this is no
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.080]   different than when I've said
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.280]   stuff before that's become a
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.160]   huge meme and a huge moment
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.200]   cultural moment. Telling the
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.720]   truth, especially when it's so
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.040]   clear and so obvious, sometimes
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   can really touch a nerve. And
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.680]   what I said is basically the
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.200]   following, which is that there
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   are all these people, the four
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.560]   of us are examples who are
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.240]   constantly doing things. And
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.160]   then we come into x and we
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.880]   don't confuse x with the arena.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.720]   You know, we don't do stuff in
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.200]   the in x, we talk on x. But
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.120]   then you go back and you
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.480]   actually do things you start
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.560]   companies, you invest in
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.240]   businesses, you incubate ideas,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   you help founders get their
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.800]   businesses off the ground.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.840]   Those are meaningful things and
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.480]   success is never guaranteed.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   But there is a small strain of
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.680]   people who just violently either
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.520]   hate themselves, or hate the
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.880]   fact that you're doing things,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.160]   and then that you talk about
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.400]   them. And I think what this
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.960]   touched was just that, in a
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.320]   simple nutshell, it forced
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.520]   people to confront the fact
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.680]   that, hey, hold on a second, am
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.160]   I this anonymous rube on the
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.880]   sideline that just throw shade
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640]   or I'm actually doing stuff
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.040]   here, I just wanted to take an
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.720]   actual direct line of attack on
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   people who are constantly
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.560]   blaming others for everything.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.920]   And if you aren't trying and
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.480]   iterating, you're a fucking
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.920]   loser, go out and try
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.120]   something. And whether it works
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.040]   or not, x is a great place to
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.280]   then go and talk about it.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.120]   That's the cycle.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.760]   Sachs, your thoughts on the man
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.320]   in the arena?
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   Well, look, I think speaking of
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   crazy, politically motivated
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.640]   witch hunts, did you see this
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.680]   latest story today? That now
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.600]   there's a new government
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.520]   investigation of Elon, they're
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.320]   investigating him for
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.920]   supposedly Tesla was going to
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.480]   build him a glass house. Which
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.520]   he said is ridiculous. It's not
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   true. So the administration, you
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.320]   know, I guess to turn a phrase
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.560]   people who live in glass houses
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.840]   shouldn't be investigating glass
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.480]   houses. You have the Biden
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.960]   administration. Now the latest
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.440]   revelations is that Biden was
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.760]   using a pseudonym in 5000 emails
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.080]   and he was emailing hunter Biden
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.440]   under the name Robert Peters. Why
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.560]   would you do that about barisma?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.600]   So this is how they're
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.800]   communicating first. Biden said
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.160]   he said,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.040]   level.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.680]   Yeah. Well, first, remember, at
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.400]   Yahoo.com. First Biden said, I
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.160]   don't know anything about my
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.640]   son's business. Then it turns
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.000]   out, based on the sworn
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.960]   testimony of Devin Archer, who
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.680]   is hunter Biden's partner, that
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.200]   Biden participated in over 20
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.760]   phone calls where he would call
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.680]   in when they're in the room with
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.520]   clients to quote be the brand.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.600]   And now we find out that Biden
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.840]   was communicating with hunter
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.200]   about recently using a pseudonym
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.440]   account, basically a burner
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.080]   account under the name Robert
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.520]   letters. Allegedly, allegedly.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.000]   Okay, but this is what the
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.480]   Comer investigations turned up.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.800]   It's certainly not looking good.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.440]   And as you said, my point is
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.400]   people are living in glass
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.000]   houses shouldn't be
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.480]   investigating glass. Here's the
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.040]   thing, like, if you're going to
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.840]   evaluate, and listen, obviously,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.800]   I'm biased. But if you're going
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   to investigate Tesla over this,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.040]   like, people can buy and trade
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.920]   the stock however they want.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.480]   Like, there seems to be some
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   Biden administration, you know,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.640]   like jihad against Elon, they're
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.960]   going after him for this. And
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.600]   totally
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.720]   a week or two ago,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.560]   summit, I mean, it's all I think
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.280]   that's where the whole thing
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.800]   started is that they wouldn't
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.120]   invite them to the summit because
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.480]   they're not a union shop. And
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.760]   then Elon spoke out about that
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.400]   member, Biden introduced the CEO
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.960]   of GM giving her credit for
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.000]   launching the whole EV
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.480]   revolution. So Elon criticized
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   administration for that. But I
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.600]   think the main reason why they
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.560]   don't like him is because what
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.240]   he's done with free speech on
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.960]   Twitter, Twitter, yeah, this
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.560]   glass house investigation is the
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.240]   second one. The one that happened
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   last week is they're
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   investigating SpaceX for
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.520]   supposedly screening out foreign
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.080]   nationals in the hiring process.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.800]   They they are saying, wait a
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.200]   sec, the DOJ is alleging that
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   SpaceX was hiring too many
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.120]   Americans, and they need to hire
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.080]   more refugees, my head spinning.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.520]   Even though even though there's a
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.360]   lot of nationals, not refugees,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.200]   no, no, no refugees, refugees, a
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.920]   refugee is somebody fleeing a
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.840]   country, Nick, because of my
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.360]   political persecution. What What
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   where did the term refugees come
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.600]   from? No, it is a term. A refugee
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.560]   is somebody fleeing a country
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.960]   because of political person
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.120]   persecution. Why would they use
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.600]   that term?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   The DOJ sued SpaceX, basically
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.680]   for DEI footfalls. They said that
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.120]   there was not enough refugees and
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.680]   asylum seekers that were being
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.040]   adequately considered and being
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.720]   hired by SpaceX. The problem with
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.920]   that, as it turns out, is that the
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.200]   DOJ is not even allowed to hire
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   asylum seekers.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.600]   I mean,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.280]   SpaceX is governed under the same
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.000]   laws, because it's a rocket
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.720]   company as advanced weapons,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.040]   contractors, and they and the
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.560]   whole industry has been under the
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.480]   belief for many years that they
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.440]   could only hire American citizens
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.120]   and green card holders for these
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.760]   very sensitive jobs. And what
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.680]   happened is earlier in the year,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.760]   the Biden administration released
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.080]   what they called a clarification
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.440]   here, I'll post this, Nick, can
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.280]   you pull this up? So the US US DOJ
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.600]   civil rights division released
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.000]   this, again, what they call the
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.280]   clarification how to avoid
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.160]   immigration related
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.480]   discrimination when complying
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.680]   with us export control laws. The
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.240]   export control laws is what
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.600]   governs rocket companies and
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   weapons contractors. It's
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.400]   basically the companies that are
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.160]   involved in these sensitive
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.480]   national security areas. Until
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.720]   now, the government was pretty
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.040]   clear that you were only supposed
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.680]   to hire US citizens and green
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.280]   card holders.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.800]   Explain to me
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.560]   because they have this crazy idea
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.920]   that that these companies, these
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.080]   national security companies
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.520]   should be hiring more refugees
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.560]   and asylum seekers, really, even
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.520]   though this is the definition of
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.160]   a national security risk. But
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.280]   they're really crazy thing. So
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.640]   first of all, I think this this
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.920]   update that they issued this is
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.640]   lawmaking. Okay, they called it a
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.000]   clarification. But this is a
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.280]   Biden administration making new
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.360]   law through Yeah, that's not the
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.680]   process. agency. I think this is
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.800]   a crazy law. It's really the
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.840]   opposite of what we should want,
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.440]   which is more Americans getting
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.720]   jobs. Saks can answer your
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   question. But what they've done
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.640]   with this lawsuit is they're
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.880]   going back and remember, the
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.200]   key here is that that was only
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.760]   issued in April of this year.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.240]   They've gone back and said that
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   from 2008 to 2022. SpaceX is
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.200]   governed by this new
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.080]   understanding. So they're
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.480]   basically making it retroactive.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.840]   Okay, putting aside this legal
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.800]   lease here for a second, I just
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.920]   want to talk first principles.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.480]   If you were a foreign government,
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.040]   and you wanted to infiltrate some
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.720]   company like SpaceX or Andrew or
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.120]   whatever, would it not be easier
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.520]   to send a quote unquote refugee
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.960]   to America, especially to get in
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.640]   versus flipping an American who
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.040]   already works there? It should be
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.080]   a much easier process, especially
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.280]   because all sense,
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.920]   right, because especially since
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   all you have to do is go to the
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   hole in the wall in Yuma, Arizona
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   as RFK Jr. showed, and you just
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.680]   mentioned the word asylum, like
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.720]   the cartel has taught you to. And
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   all of a sudden, you're a refugee
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.560]   you're in, they give you a piece
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.400]   of paper that tells you you're
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.280]   going to be in court in three
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.040]   years, but you're in 1000s of
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.320]   people 10s without millions of
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.080]   people have done this.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.720]   Also, another pragmatic question
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.200]   for you, how many people who are
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.400]   coming in as asylum seekers have
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.600]   the advanced degrees or
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   background to work at Andrew
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.000]   spacex? I don't know, pick a pick
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.120]   an aerospace weapons based
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.080]   company. Like what percentage of
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.560]   refugees do you think coming
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.640]   across the southern border or
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.800]   whatever border they're coming in
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.680]   would actually have those
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.000]   qualifications. So anyway, this
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.080]   seems insane.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.360]   Well, and so Jake, you raised an
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   interesting point, because I
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.600]   think one of the really unusual
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.360]   things about this DOJ lawsuit
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.760]   against SpaceX is that the
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.040]   remedies are seeking are
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.240]   unprecedented. What they've said
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.040]   is, anybody who was screened out
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.600]   as part of this process, was
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.760]   entitled to back pay lost wages,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.240]   since they were screened out. So
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.840]   in other words, it assumes that
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.000]   every single one of those people
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.720]   would have been hired
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.040]   gotten the job when they got the
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.600]   job, they hire one out of 1000
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   or one out of 100 applicants gets
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.360]   hired.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.200]   If they could have gotten a job
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.600]   at SpaceX, as we all know, their
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.080]   bar for hiring is incredibly
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.480]   high, they probably didn't have
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.240]   damages because they could
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.280]   probably get jobs at 10 other
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.160]   companies as well.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.840]   Oh my god, the Biden
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.800]   administration is just like
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.160]   self inflicted wounds here. This
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.400]   is so dumb. What a stupid
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.440]   approach
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.040]   is the glass house thing, a
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.840]   misallocation of funds claim
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.320]   like it's a securities issue. Is
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   that what
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.760]   it's a securities issue that it
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.480]   was improperly disclosed and that
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.320]   they may not have filed the
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.560]   proper taxes because it would
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.920]   have been a paid benefit to
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.400]   Elon. Right? Right.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.760]   But I mean, don't you feel like
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.640]   this is a stretch? I mean, they
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.480]   are stretching every law they
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.760]   can to go after this guy, it's
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.680]   getting to be a little bit
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.240]   trump to bring it up.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   Let's be clear. Here's what's
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.120]   happening. I think that when
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   Elon bought Twitter, what
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.880]   effectively happened is the
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.960]   biggest psyops organization for
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.720]   the Democratic Party was taken
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.480]   away from them. And I think that
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.600]   they are increasingly feeling
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.040]   like if it really does, if
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   Twitter or x becomes a town
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.920]   square, that's really bad for
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.480]   them. And so they can't shape
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   people, they can't amplify the
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.840]   victimization, they can't
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.520]   amplify the government's going
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.960]   to save you narratives. And so
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.440]   this is the sort of death by 1000
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.360]   cuts approach that the blob has
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.560]   of trying to bring him down. And
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.960]   so you see a DOJ lawsuit over
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.760]   here, it's, you know, nominal,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.800]   but whatever, then you're going
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.400]   to see, you know, the SEC
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   investigation over $50,000 of
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.560]   glass, I mean, the guy is worth
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.120]   a quarter of a trillion dollars,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.800]   and we're sweating the $50,000
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.760]   glass purchase. But the point is,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.120]   the goal is to tie him up, and to
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.480]   distract him. And to basically
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.120]   take resources away his mind
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.080]   share from working. Now, we all
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.560]   know him. So he's going to do the
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.760]   exact same work. Not gonna work.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.320]   Alex Spiro is going to have a job
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.400]   for the rest of his life. That's
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.680]   his lawyer from Quinn Emanuel.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.400]   And Alex is going to beat these
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.840]   things back. And generally, Alex
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.400]   will win most lawsuits. I say
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.600]   most. But not all. But anyways,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.160]   the point is that the point is
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.400]   that
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.880]   I think you're exactly right
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.400]   about what's motivating this and
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.720]   what's going on. But I'll tell
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.160]   you when it all began is that
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.720]   Biden has a press conference,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.600]   where he said that Elon needed to
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.000]   be looked at. Do you remember
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   this? Yeah, Biden said, Well, I
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:25.960]   don't know that he wants to do
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.280]   anything wrong. But I think we
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.920]   need to look at his relationships
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.360]   with other countries. So this
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.160]   was the signal to all of the
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.400]   ambitious apparatchiks in our
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.760]   law enforcement agencies, looking
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.800]   for advancement, that he's the
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.520]   target go after him find
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.880]   something. Now, in fact, they
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.840]   couldn't find anything. So they
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.880]   look at his relation with other
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.000]   countries. And what you would
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.640]   expect is that maybe he hired
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.760]   some foreign nationals he
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.560]   shouldn't have. But it was the
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.600]   exact opposite. They didn't hire
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.960]   foreign nationals. The crime
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.120]   will get you. It reminds me of
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.600]   the whole Alvin Bragg thing where
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.040]   Alvin Bragg made that case, that
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   Trump was required by campaign
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   finance laws to pay Stormy
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.920]   Daniels using donor money. But
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   you know, you know that if they
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.360]   had found that Trump paid Stormy
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.040]   Daniels with donations, they
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.760]   would have charged him with that.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.360]   It's like investigating the guy
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.040]   finding he did nothing wrong, and
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   then charging him with the
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.800]   opposite. What do you know
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.720]   equivalency between these and
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.080]   Trump's behavior, but
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.200]   it's the weaponization of the
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.920]   justice system. It showed me the
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.280]   man and I'll show you the crime.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.160]   Now, incorrect with the last two.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.760]   I mean, he committed a lot of
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.600]   crimes, but we'll leave that off
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.640]   the docket for now. We're going
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.840]   to read a disagree on that one.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.360]   Okay. Just very interesting media
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.800]   related story and find you're
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.960]   giving Robert Peters too much
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.600]   credit. I mean, Joe Biden.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.120]   I'm listening. Biden's got to go.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.880]   Trump's got to go. We need a new
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.000]   platform. I have announced that I
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.160]   am supporting Nikki Halley and
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.440]   Chris Christie slash Revec.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.160]   Vivek. That would be my ideal
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.560]   ticket right now. I want the only
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.320]   person freeberg who brought up
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.520]   spending in either party. Nikki
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:11.760]   Halley.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.800]   I let's just agree. I'll move on.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   But I just want to also say we
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.760]   were wondering who won the debate
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.480]   last week. Biggest increase Nikki
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.240]   Halley. So I didn't see the
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   tribune. What's it look like?
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.840]   I think she went from two to nine
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.680]   seven to nine in different in
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   different polls. So it's
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.040]   somewhere between she tripled
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.280]   was not a huge bounce. I think
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.200]   you went I think you're right.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.960]   She went to nine to seven.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.680]   There was one two to seven one
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   two to nine but putting it aside
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.200]   the Trump people are actually
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.000]   promoting it because they want
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.920]   Trump to be up against a bunch.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.720]   They want to be up against a
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.960]   bunch of kids. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.320]   Three people at 10 to 15% is
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.880]   better than one at 30. I was
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.920]   probably correct.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.320]   Could I just ask because I haven't
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.640]   followed it this week. What was
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.040]   the set? What like after it
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   settled after the bounces and the
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.800]   spikes? saxipoo? What? Where?
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.840]   Where are we at now in the
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.920]   Republican race after this past
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.040]   week and having people having a
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   chance to really figure out what
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.640]   happened in the debate? Yeah,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.120]   exactly. Yeah,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.600]   I think the consensus view just
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   about is that the biggest
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   beneficiary of the debate was
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.000]   Vivek Ramaswamy. By far. Yes,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.320]   Nikki Haley did get a little bit
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.840]   of a bounce, but Vivek got a
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.960]   much bigger one. He's much
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.160]   better known to the base now.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.440]   And I think that it's Vivek and
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.640]   DeSantis are now more or less
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.880]   neck and neck for number two.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.680]   Haley might be number three at
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.240]   this point. But I think it helped
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.880]   Vivek the most. Now. It's also
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.160]   true that he got a lot of
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.360]   criticism. But I think that's
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.480]   kind of where he wants to be. I
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.040]   mean, you want to be the center
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.960]   of attention. And the people who
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.160]   are attacking him now are all
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.960]   these neocons. It's basically
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.320]   the whole military industrial
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.400]   complex. It's all the bond paid
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.800]   for politicians and think tanks
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.640]   who, you know, want America to
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.760]   be in these forever wars. So I
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.720]   think he's being attacked by the
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.520]   right people. And that's going
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.960]   to help him. Yeah.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.280]   So sacks you you see him like
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.760]   basically, it's going to be
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.920]   Trump versus Vivek, if this
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.600]   continues.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.480]   Well, it's hard to say. I mean,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.240]   I think the census is still in
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.720]   the mix. I think it's noteworthy
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.240]   that the top three candidates
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.600]   all have expressed significant
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.520]   either misgivings or opposition
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.520]   to our involvement in Ukraine.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.440]   Trump, Vivek and DeSantis with
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.600]   varying degrees of strength have
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.800]   basically all opposed Biden's
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.480]   policy. And they are the leading
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.520]   candidates in the Republican
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.600]   primary. I think that's telling
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.320]   you something very important.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.440]   Haley, Christie, Pence, Tim
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.800]   Scott, they all would like to do
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.400]   even more in Ukraine. And that
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.040]   is not where the party is. So
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.920]   some of the country is nobody's
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.360]   there. One other piece of
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.720]   debate fallout that I thought
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.520]   was really interesting was that
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.040]   they interviewed Oliver Anthony.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.120]   Remember the the guy who sings
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.000]   that song? The Richmond North
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.640]   Richmond, because Fox News made
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   the first question about his
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.760]   song. And he clarified what the
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.320]   song was about what he said is,
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.880]   the Richmond he's talking about
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.520]   North Richmond are the people in
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.400]   DC. It's the blob. And with the
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   same people on the debate stage.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.640]   Yeah. Well, but what he said
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.560]   specifically was it was the it
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.400]   was the people who got us into
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.920]   all these endless wars when I
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.440]   was growing up. It was the
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.000]   Republicans who did specifically
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.440]   he was talking about Bush Cheney
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.920]   Republicans, neocons. He made
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.640]   that explicit and clear. I'm
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.240]   singing more about like a lot of
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.680]   the older super conservative
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.640]   politicians that brought us into
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.880]   endless war through my entire
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.480]   childhood. Those are Bush era
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.080]   neocons. He said the people on
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.160]   that stage is who I'm talking
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.560]   about. Don't use my song. This
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.920]   song is not a left or a right
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.400]   song. It's about the people. It
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000]   was a song about his
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.200]   contemporaries is what he said.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.000]   Not and he's talking about both
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.160]   parties. And he said, specifically
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.400]   if the people on that stage I'm
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.560]   talking about, don't use my song
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.680]   again. Okay, let's go on to the
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   next story. There was a leaked
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.600]   document. And we had this come up
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.840]   last week, the leaked document was
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.720]   sent to Chamath. And it was about
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.240]   Tiger Global's struggles. It had
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.680]   a line at the top that said this
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.440]   was a spiked or a draft of a New
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.920]   Yorker story. And a draft is the
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.200]   way they said it. And we had a
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.280]   little conversation about here,
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.800]   we decided not to publish it, we
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.160]   had a little discussion, because
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   we did not think in our private
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.840]   discussion, that this was a real
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.200]   story, high star grammatical
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.640]   errors in it. SAC said, we really
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.800]   can't publish something like this
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.920]   because it's slanderous, and we
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   don't know the provenance of it.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.520]   And on Friday, Tiger sent a letter
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.800]   to its LPS in response to the
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.040]   document. They wrote that they are
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.680]   being targeted, quote targeted
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.120]   with a series of misinformation
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.640]   attacks, anonymously using a
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.920]   cryptic messaging platforms like
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.640]   signal we strongly believe these
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.840]   were written by a disgruntled
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.120]   form employee with whom we parted
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.800]   ways unlike the anonymous coward
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.000]   spreading this false narrative on
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.600]   the internet. You know who we are.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.240]   And we are here and ready to
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.720]   answer your questions. Rest
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.080]   assured, our team remains highly
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.280]   focused on our core business,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.840]   which has been forming this year.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.720]   So Chamath, just your broad
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.520]   thoughts on the Tiger Global non
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.320]   story, fake faux story by a former
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.680]   employee. Chase is a incredible
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.160]   person. I've said this before, he
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.720]   helped me get into the business of
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.240]   investing, he seeded my first
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   angel fund. I was pretty helpful,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.840]   I think in getting them on the cap
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.600]   table at Facebook many, many years
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.960]   ago, which helped them get going
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.560]   as well. So I think that he's a
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.240]   wonderful human being. And I've
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.520]   had nothing but positive things to
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.880]   say about him. Scott Schleifer, I
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.960]   don't know as well. But he seems
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.280]   like clearly a hard charging
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.720]   person that's achieved quite a lot.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.600]   And so I'm glad that we didn't
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.800]   publish it or talk about it. And if
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.480]   there is something to be said, the
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.280]   story will be validated and people
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   will get to the bottom of it. What
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.680]   is crazy is I don't understand what
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.640]   this document actually serves,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.520]   except exactly as you said, to a
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.680]   disgruntled person who has
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.480]   absolutely no economics, meaning,
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.720]   if you're an LP, you don't want
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.120]   this document to be out. If you're
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.560]   a partner that has carry, you don't
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.520]   want this out into the out in the
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.360]   wild either. If you're a portfolio
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.960]   company, you don't want this
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.800]   document out in the wild. I tend to
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.200]   believe that this is just a
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.360]   disgruntled person. Again, look,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   I've had this experience as well. So
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.600]   which is that there are all kinds
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.840]   of employees who work with you. We
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.200]   try our best as leaders of
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.120]   organizations to compensate them
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.040]   as well. But invariably, what I find
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.920]   are people overestimate their
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.080]   contributions. And people try to
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.280]   take way more credit. They try to
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.760]   take credit for deals that they've
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.960]   done that they didn't actually do.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.640]   They try to take credit for all the
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.440]   internal workings. And then
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.520]   invariably, when the leadership
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.680]   decides that those folks aren't a
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.240]   good fit anymore, mostly for
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.040]   cultural reasons, and are exited,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.120]   they have a bone to pick and an
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.360]   axe to grind. And they try to sort
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.520]   of distribute misinformation to
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.560]   other LPS to other GPS to
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.520]   portfolio company CEOs. It's
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.240]   happened to me. It's happened to
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.400]   chase. It's happened to Sequoia.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.840]   It's happened to any of us that
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.960]   have been successful. So
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.920]   extra grind people, you know,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.960]   it's just like, again, it's just
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.880]   another example of like, there are
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.320]   the people that are in the arena
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   doing and then there are the
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.880]   people that kind of get kicked out
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.560]   and really upset and lose track of
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   what's important. These people
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.200]   instead of writing these missives
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.360]   should be working.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.720]   Yeah. I mean, how how disgruntled
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.840]   sacks does a former employee need
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.160]   to be to put in this kind of effort
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.960]   to write a 10 page faux New Yorker
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.080]   style expose and you were the voice
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.760]   of reason I think in our group chat
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.880]   and just saying like, I don't even
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.040]   think we should talk about it in a
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.360]   meta kind of way. We weren't going
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.280]   to cover the details of it. But
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.960]   we did have a discussion of it. You
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.440]   put the kibosh on which we would
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.400]   have been first like kind of
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.000]   highlighting this craziness, but
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.440]   you took a pretty hard stance and
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.280]   your thoughts on it.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.480]   Well, it was written like it was
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.040]   some sort of journalistic article,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.160]   but a journalistic article has a
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   byline, you know, who wrote it, you
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.960]   know, who publishes it, it has
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   provenance, you know, therefore, who
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.600]   is liable if it's slanderous. Yeah.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.800]   This piece that was going around had
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.480]   none of those things. And therefore
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.160]   my view was that we shouldn't
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.840]   discuss it. And my view is we
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.440]   shouldn't even mention it because
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.880]   all you're then doing is drawing
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.000]   attention to something that again,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   you don't know the providence of
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.800]   and you don't know whether it's
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.760]   true or not. And you don't know
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.880]   who's standing by it. Now, what's
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.920]   happened in the last week is that
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.360]   Tiger has issued a statement about
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.400]   it. And that statement was covered
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   by the press. So I guess we can
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.200]   talk about the fact that they've
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.120]   had to respond to this. I'm still
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.080]   not comfortable talking about any
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.200]   of the contents of it. Because
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.400]   again, we don't have nobody's put
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.160]   their name by it. So why even put
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.560]   a position of needing to respond
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.640]   to it? Yeah. Until somebody is
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.720]   willing to basically raise their
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.280]   hand and say, this is what I
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.400]   think. The piece that was
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.440]   circulated was a mix of both
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.240]   business criticism or business
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.360]   issues and personal slander. So,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.880]   I mean, are there business issues
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.280]   in there that we could discuss?
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.720]   Yeah. I mean, then they would be
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.520]   interesting, but until we know
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.120]   that there's some authenticity to
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.360]   it, I don't feel comfortable
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.160]   giving any attention whatsoever to
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   this thing. Personally, I think
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.960]   even talking about it now is still
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.560]   a waste of time.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.160]   Freeberg, any thoughts on it just
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.200]   as we wrap here?
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.600]   No, it's clearly a disgruntled
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.800]   person trying to cast a negative
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.240]   light.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.120]   Just get a job bro. All right.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.040]   D dollarization corner bricks
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.360]   added six new members climbing to
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.280]   11 total and bricks. Of course,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.040]   everybody knows Brazil, Russia,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.600]   India, China and South Africa.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.760]   These four countries make up 40%
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.440]   of the world's population 25% of
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.600]   global GDP joining the bricks
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   block are Saudi Arabia, Iran,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.360]   UAE new bricks and it's kind of
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   being set up as like an
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.280]   alternative to G seven g eight I
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.920]   guess new bricks makes up almost
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   50% of the global population with
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.120]   a third of GDP. This is the first
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.880]   expansion in 13 years since South
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.840]   Africa joined sacks. You've got
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   some thoughts on the bricks and a
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.440]   little presentation here. Inform
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:34.960]   the audience.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.840]   Alright, so Jake, like you said,
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.240]   they added six new members.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.760]   Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.600]   Saudi Arabia and UAE. This on top
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.240]   of the original five members. Now,
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.680]   you've described this group of
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.080]   countries as mid I don't know what
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.640]   metric you're using to make that
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.720]   determination. If you look at share
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.640]   of global GDP in purchasing power
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.280]   parity terms, and we can debate
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.880]   whether that's the right method or
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.080]   not. But a lot of economists
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.920]   believe that PPP is the right way
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.840]   to look at it. The original bricks
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.080]   were 32% of global GDP, the new
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.600]   bricks bring it to 37%. And there's
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.000]   a couple dozen more countries have
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.600]   expressed an interest in joining
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.800]   bricks, which would bring it to 45.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.920]   The G seven is only 30%. And that
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.720]   number has been declining over time
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.480]   back in 1995. It was all the way at
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.880]   45%. Whereas the bricks were only
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.600]   about 17%. You can see that decline
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.520]   or shift here in this chart going
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.080]   all the way back to the 1980s.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.320]   This is why I think a lot of
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.680]   Americans have this casually
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.640]   dismissive attitude towards the
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   bricks is they're thinking that
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.600]   these countries are still living in
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.520]   the era of the 1990s of uni
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   polarity. When the G seven was, you
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.880]   know, more than half of global GDP,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.400]   but now the bricks are bigger than
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.840]   the G seven, again, in terms of PPP,
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.760]   the rest have risen, and it's become
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.040]   a very substantial part of the world
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.240]   economy. If you look at global oil
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.720]   production, the new bricks now have
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.440]   54% of global oil production, it's
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.640]   almost double what the G seven
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.840]   produces, despite the US still being
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.160]   the number one producer of oil. We're
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.440]   not the biggest exporter because we
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.200]   use it all.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.120]   Just to add to that point, oil is, of
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.960]   course, a declining commodity with
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.240]   renewables and nuclear and people
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.320]   don't rely on it less. So sure, I
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.560]   don't think renewables are anywhere
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.800]   close to be able to replace fossil
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   fuels. If it's actually hold on, let
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.000]   me just answer to that. It's cheaper
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.880]   now, and Chamath can speak to this to
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.080]   install solar wind than it is to do a
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.440]   lot of the carbon based fuels. So it
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.840]   actually has tipped economically, where
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.920]   it's I think, cheaper and 80% of cases
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.520]   85% of cases to install renewables. Is
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.040]   that correct? From broadly speaking,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.880]   the cost of solar is effectively now
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.000]   the the cheapest form of energy, you
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.480]   know, on a kilowatt per hour basis.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.520]   Great. Okay, continue.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.880]   Well, this is a prevent journey from
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.440]   sliding into a massive recession
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.960]   because they're not able to get cheap
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   energy anymore.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.600]   Yeah, they turned out also, that also
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.040]   supposes that you have the actual
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.120]   supply. And to David's point, why
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.360]   Germany has such a difficult issues
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   because they turned off that gas, they
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.960]   turned off the reactor, and there's
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.760]   just not enough solar installed right
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.320]   now. So, you know, you also think
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.560]   about a country. What I just meant was
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.240]   more the levelized cost of energy,
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.800]   which is if you had an installation
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.760]   here and an installation there of two
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.520]   different modes of energy generation,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.880]   solar is cheaper. But Dave, David is
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.760]   right, like, you know, it's still
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.960]   going to take some time for the
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.000]   proliferation of solar
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.680]   agrees with that.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.840]   Yeah, we all agree.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.520]   The US is already roughly energy
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.440]   independent, we produce about 20
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.400]   million barrels of oil a day, we
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.880]   consume about 20 million. So we are
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.120]   roughly neutral. With respect to the
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.400]   world, we're neither a net importer or
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.840]   net exporter as of now. So I oil is
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.360]   still going to be a huge, it's the
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.640]   number one global commodity. If BRICS
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.880]   adds Venezuela, Algeria and Kazakhstan
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.840]   as they may do, as soon as next year,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.320]   they'll control 90% of all oil and gas
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.880]   traded globally, you're going to have
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.280]   an OPEC plus BRICS sort of symbiosis
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.480]   because Russia and Saudi Arabia
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.520]   basically run OPEC plus new BRICS is
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.040]   also really strong in food production.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.120]   Five of the world's six biggest food
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.720]   producers are now part of BRICS China,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.920]   Brazil, India, Argentina, Russia. The
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.680]   only other one is the US. They have 46%
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.200]   of global population, 36% of global
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.280]   landmass. So my point is BRICS isn't
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.880]   just strong in global GDP, they're
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.600]   strong in the production of what are
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.760]   currently the two most important
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.240]   commodities in the world, which is oil
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.280]   and food. They also have influence over
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.920]   strategic trade routes. So if you look
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.040]   at where these countries are located,
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.520]   and I'm sure this went into the
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.000]   thinking of who they just admitted to
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.960]   BRICS, because they had a lot of
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.200]   choices, that's something like 26
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.880]   countries applied, and these are the
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.840]   first six they've added. So they now
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.600]   control the Arctic Sea route, which is
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.720]   basically as the polar ice cap starts to
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.120]   melt in the Arctic, you're seeing a new
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   ability to create maritime routes north
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.440]   of Russia, basically, from Europe to
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.640]   Asia, it's a much faster route than
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.880]   going around the Horn of Africa or
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.200]   through the Suez Canal. You have this
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.680]   international north south
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.600]   transportation corridor, which is
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.160]   basically a combination of overland
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.720]   routes and some maritime that connect
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.880]   Russia, Iran and India. You've got
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.400]   Belt and Road, these east west
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   corridors, you've got the Persian Gulf,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.960]   the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, they're
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.840]   all now part of BRICS. And the point of
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.160]   that, I think strategically is to
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.360]   bypass choke points like the Strait of
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.240]   Singapore, the Strait of Malacca, the
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.920]   Bosphorus, and the Strait of Hormuz. So
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.320]   the point here is that the US Navy has
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.520]   very strategically over decades, been
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.120]   circling China with military bases on,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.200]   you know, island chains around China,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.640]   this is going to basically neutralize
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.080]   that whole strategy because China will
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.400]   have ways of securing its trade routes
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.600]   over land, or again, over sea going
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.840]   through the Arctic. So this has huge
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.200]   geostrategic implications. The other
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.920]   big thing that I think BRICS is doing
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.440]   is they have this five to 10 year goal
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.680]   of allowing BRICS members to sell
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.720]   trades and local currencies. I think
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.200]   that you guys may be seeing it the
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.240]   wrong way. The goal here is not to
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.200]   create a new reserve currency. It's
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.960]   simply to create a way to bypass the
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   dollar complex. They're trying to break
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.080]   the petrodollar monopoly. This is not an
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.840]   offensive organization. And they're not
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.080]   necessarily trying to create a single
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.960]   alternative to the US dollar. They are
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.880]   trying to create a way to not have to go
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.800]   through the dollar complex in order to
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.680]   do their trade when they're trading with
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.200]   each other.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.160]   And I would like to
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.880]   say China and Brazil are doing is a test
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.000]   case for this, where they are setting up
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.400]   a yuan clearing arrangement with Brazil.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.800]   And the goal to be clear, Sax here is to
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.160]   have a voice versus the G seven, which
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.200]   they feel they've a lot of these
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.600]   countries feel they've been left out of
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.560]   and to maybe not have as much
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.680]   dependency on the West and form this
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.040]   block that has a bigger voice in the
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   world, right?
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.240]   I go a little further and say this isn't
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.520]   just about them having a voice. It's
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.440]   about them having economic sovereignty.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.640]   They do not want to be completely
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.880]   dependent on the United States to secure
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.640]   their economies. And the big driver of
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.720]   this has been the weaponization of the
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.440]   US dollar.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.880]   And swept. Yeah.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.400]   Yes. So in conjunction with this Ukraine
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.640]   war, the US sees Russia's foreign
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.040]   reserves, which were in dollars, they've
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.640]   widely imposed sanctions were now
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.440]   sanctioning dozens and dozens of
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.240]   countries. And we are tactically
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.400]   limiting who can use Swift as part of
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.160]   this. So if you are any of the BRICS
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.920]   countries, you're asking yourself, wait
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.200]   a second, when I am doing business with
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.320]   another member of BRICS, why should the
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.200]   US be any part of that transaction?
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.000]   Yeah, they do not want that
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.160]   transaction to be mediated by the US at
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.400]   all,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.240]   in a way, it's like people buying crypto
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.040]   so that they don't have to deal with the
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.440]   US government. They have, you know, they
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.320]   have Bitcoin over here, and they're not
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.240]   subject to the rules of the US dollar,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.320]   right? It's like a way of
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.560]   some independence. Yeah, I totally get
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:26.640]   it.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.240]   They're willing to play by the US's rules
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.440]   when they're trading with the US. But
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.920]   they do not want to play by the US's
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360]   rules when they're not trading with the
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.800]   US or the g seven. And this is about
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.840]   creating that independence.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.480]   I think it's great that they have to
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.320]   moth that there is a competitor to the US
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.760]   dollar because it makes us be more
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.920]   thoughtful about our spending
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.000]   ultimately, and our balance sheet. What
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.720]   are your thoughts on all this?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.400]   I have a couple. So if you go back to
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.120]   when the bricks was created, this is
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.800]   like 20 plus years ago, it was first
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.400]   just brick and with a small
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.440]   2001. And, and then it became bricks
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.920]   with a big ass when they admitted South
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.080]   Africa, I think the the fact pattern in
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   that organization is pretty poor. You
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.960]   know, when they first got organized,
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.800]   they tried to create a competitor to the
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.920]   IMF. I think it's called the IDB, the
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.920]   International Development Bank. That
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.680]   bank is not dispersed a single dollar.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   In 23 years, they tried to create a
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.840]   joint program to lay undersea fiber
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.240]   amongst these countries hasn't even
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.080]   started. So I think it's good that this
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.240]   organization is growing. I think the
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.760]   problem is that the actual amount of
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.320]   legislative coordination that these
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.160]   countries has been able to exhibit has
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.640]   been literally zero. And the problem now
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.560]   is that their regional rivalries are
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.880]   only growing. So China and India, which
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.280]   are the two anchor partners of bricks
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   are literally in a land war. There's a
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.880]   border that they fight over with, with
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.640]   guns. You have a growing anti Chinese
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.800]   resentment inside of both India and
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.080]   Brazil, Nick, you can just throw up this
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.120]   little chart. In India, they've blocked a
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.800]   lot of apps, they're about to block a
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.640]   bunch of imports. But India sees China
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.760]   as as as an existential threat. The
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.680]   Brazilian population, this is just a
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   poll that the economist put in. There's
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.640]   just a lot of anti Chinese sentiment. So
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   it's very hard to see folks that are
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.840]   such polar enemies actually working
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.120]   together, even if they're part of an
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.960]   organization. So I think that the the
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.040]   odds of legislative coordination in the
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.600]   future are probably less than what they
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.320]   were even 10 years ago. So I expect even
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.880]   less and it's hard to expect even less
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.320]   when nothing has been done. And then the
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.920]   second is I just look at the data. And
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   if you look at swift in July, you know,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.040]   the swift volumes on us dollars was the
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.560]   largest ever. And so it's kind of one of
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.400]   these weird things where I think that
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.040]   it's good that that organization exists.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.640]   Don't get me wrong, because I do think
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.280]   that if they could Oh, the other thing
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.640]   that I'll say about the BRICS, which is
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.360]   kind of odd is that unlike the g7, and
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.040]   unlike NATO, where you have democratic
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.800]   ideals that underpin the organizational
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.920]   framework. Here, it doesn't because you
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.480]   have China, Russia, Iran, which are total
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.080]   polar opposites to Brazil and India in
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.720]   terms of democratic governance. And I
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.600]   don't know enough about Ethiopia or
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.280]   Egypt to say anything. So if they
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.880]   don't get challenged states at a
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.200]   minimum, one that I'm just saying,
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.040]   they're not democratic the way like NATO
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.840]   and the g7 are all democratically
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.360]   elected countries. It's a very good
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.480]   point. They don't share the same
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.360]   operating system, the authoritarians and
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.120]   democratic nations put together. So then
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.480]   the last thing is, could you see a
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.600]   currency framework to compete against
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.280]   the US dollar. And I think the practical
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.000]   complexity is if you take all of these
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.040]   other issues, land wars, import controls
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.480]   and growing Chinese resentment, and now
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.560]   try to boil that into an exchange rate
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.760]   mechanism where the renminbi and the
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.040]   rupee and the Ray I can be
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.920]   interchangeable. I think it's very
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.360]   difficult to see because if you look at
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.120]   the last time that that happened, the
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.200]   Frank the lira, the pound sterling, the
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.160]   Deutsche Mark, that was possible
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.000]   because all of those other factors were
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.680]   not on the table, they were not fighting
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.560]   with each other. There wasn't this anti
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.400]   resentment in one country to another
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.320]   country, they roughly held the same
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.920]   democratic ideals. So I think my comment
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.400]   is, I think it's good that BRICS is
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   growing. I think that if they can get
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.680]   some legislative or policy coordination
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   wins, it'll be great. The track record is
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.800]   literally zero. And the setup doesn't to
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.760]   me mean much yet, but hopefully that
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.880]   something happens, who knows,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.640]   Friedberg or that's, I think, the
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.400]   arguments about the pragmatism of non
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.600]   dollar denominated trade, and the
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.520]   progress that's been realized or can be
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.280]   projected to be realized from current
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.800]   policy can be debated. What I think is
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.840]   most important is the signal that's
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   being given, which is that there is a
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.160]   desire by a larger percentage of global
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.720]   GDP than is represented by the G seven
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.040]   to de dollar eyes. And so while these
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.960]   intentions may be difficult to
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.040]   translate into policy in the near term,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.840]   that signal says a lot about the
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   influence, and perhaps the policy of the
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.160]   US in addressing and dealing with a lot
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.600]   of these countries and global economic
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.200]   actors, but I don't think they want to
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.120]   de dollar eyes. That's not part of their
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.640]   they want to increase trade is the
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.240]   stated mission and they want to
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.880]   collaborate on trade that that is that
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   free state admission. Do you think the
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.880]   state admission is de dollarization? Or
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.800]   do you think the implicit outcome is
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.640]   de dollarization?
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.600]   No, the local currency support
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.000]   initiatives are implicit de dollar
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.800]   de dollarization. I don't hear anyone
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.000]   saying we got to destroy the dollar
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.640]   because they're all very important trade
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.800]   partners. Most of those countries are
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.280]   very important trade partners with the
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.240]   US and very dependent on on trade with
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.360]   the US. It seems less that it's about,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.680]   hey, we've got to hurt the US and it's
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.240]   more about we have to be independent
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.600]   from the US. We have to be independent,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.560]   implicit in that is independent from the
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.040]   US. So and I think that that tone that
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.600]   signal says a lot about US economic
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.920]   policy and US foreign policy, that
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.000]   there's something off with the
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.240]   unipolarity is a sax has pointed out
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.480]   that it's not de facto anymore, that
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.280]   there is intention here for there to be
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.040]   something different.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.920]   Yeah, that's very healthy. That's very,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.160]   very healthy. And I think that that
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.960]   opens up avenues and paths that we're
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.760]   not thinking about today. I know all of
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.800]   a sudden we'll wake up and we'll be
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.520]   like, whoops. And we need to be
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.320]   thoughtful about that.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.760]   I think that's the most powerful part of
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.320]   sax is commentary is that it's a very
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.520]   firm establishment, even if of the
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.520]   lack of the non unipolarity of the
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.040]   world. But the thing that the bricks
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.120]   have to do is I would just encourage
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   them book a quick win, there has to be
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.400]   some policy coordination that they
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.760]   could do to prove that there's
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.400]   something there that's more than just a
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.000]   get together once a year. And that's
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.800]   been missing for 22 years so far. And
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.560]   that would have a really important. I
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.920]   think effect. Yeah, I agree with you,
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.680]   David. I think that's the litmus test
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.600]   that hasn't happened yet.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.880]   Let me partially agree with that. And
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.920]   then partially respond to what you're
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.880]   saying before tomorrow. So it's true
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.240]   that bricks does not have an impressive
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.600]   record of accomplishment to date. That's
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.120]   simply true. However, recent events, I
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.160]   think have provided the motivation for
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.480]   this group of countries to now try and
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.080]   get something done. In the past, it was
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.600]   just so phenomenally convenient to be
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.720]   based on the US dollar complex, because
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.280]   everything's priced in dollars, easy to
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.200]   transact in dollars. And when you run a
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.800]   trade surplus, the US has an open capital
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.120]   account, and you can just park the money
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.080]   in US treasuries. So there was never a
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.440]   reason for any of these countries to
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.280]   want to leave the US dollar complex
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.960]   until more recently, when again, US
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.800]   foreign policy has militarized and
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.880]   weaponized the dollar and to try and
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.280]   make it a course of instrument to get
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.000]   these countries to do what the US wants.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.240]   And all those countries now are
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.280]   bristling at that and they want to
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.760]   maintain their sovereignty. And so now
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.840]   they have tremendous motivation to get
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.480]   this done. Now the thing they've
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.720]   already agreed to and done as part of
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.880]   bricks is that when you join bricks, you
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.800]   agree not to sanction any other member of
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.240]   bricks. That is a meaningful
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.320]   commitment. And obviously, it has a lot
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.240]   to do with this Ukraine war, and the
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.560]   fact that the US has been demanding it
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.960]   to the whole world sanctioned Russia,
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.520]   and most of the world has not been
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.120]   sanctioning Russia. And that's why the
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.920]   sanctions have not been effective is the
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.480]   US has not been able to get that done.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.720]   The US will not be able to get it done
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.560]   in the future with respect to at least
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.400]   the countries who are members of bricks
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.520]   with regard to their trade with each
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.400]   other. And as we saw in the percentage
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.080]   of world GDP, bricks very rapidly once
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.160]   they add a few more members are going
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.480]   to be at about 50% of world GDP. So the
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.200]   US is only gonna be able to influence
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.320]   call it roughly that half a global GDP
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.200]   where the US or the G seven is a major
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.760]   trading partner. Now, what bricks will be
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.360]   lacking is the way on a technical level
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.640]   to bring about the sovereignty they want.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.920]   So they need to have a way to settle on
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.880]   clear transactions. And they need to have
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   a place to park the surplus that's
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   created for net exporters. And they
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.360]   haven't quite figured that out yet. So
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.200]   for example, there's a recent news item,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.920]   where Russia, which is selling a huge
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   amount of oil to India right now, it was
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.800]   saying that they don't want to
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.600]   accumulate more rupees. So they've got
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   to figure out what do we do with all
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.480]   these extra rupees. So there's a lot of
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.720]   pieces to figure out here. And that is
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.320]   why they're saying this is a goal they
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.960]   have over the next five to 10 years.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.920]   It's not one to two year time frame is
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.080]   five to 10 years, but
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.600]   let them make they should make their own
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.440]   euro if they feel so strongly that
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.240]   they're a great voting block, make a
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.920]   euro, and then they could all put into
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   it. And you can see what happens when a
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.280]   bunch of dictators and a long tail of
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.000]   failed states now share a common, a
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.680]   common currency, it's not going to work.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.560]   These countries are all each other.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.440]   Yeah, states who share
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.400]   very troubled states, by the way. Yeah,
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.840]   GDP has been going up like a rocket.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.760]   J. Cal, that's the point. Inflation.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.120]   Furthermore, their goal, we have to be
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.440]   democracy, human rights. Yeah, their
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.840]   goal is not to create a common currency,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.680]   like the euro. And I'm just saying in
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.680]   India and Brazil are not going to
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.200]   replace you on and rupees with some
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.640]   sort of new euro like currency. Moreover,
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.360]   they're not trying to create a reserve
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.600]   currency that's going to be a currency
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.760]   for the man on the street. This is about
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.440]   settlement of global trade flows, and
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.880]   getting out from under the US dollar
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.400]   complex.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.000]   My point just to be clear, freeberg is
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.680]   if you were to think of it as a thought
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.280]   experiment, these to Chamath point, these
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.800]   are culturally and strategically very
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.280]   different countries. And I think what
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.960]   they have in common is that they haven't
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.040]   been included in the G seven. And really
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.000]   America's reaction to this should be to
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.920]   get India out of this and get them into
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.960]   the G seven and make that strategic
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.240]   decision that India is the most important
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.120]   country for us to have strong
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.000]   relationships with. It's kind of hard to
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.240]   put Saudi Arabia and put you a in this,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.320]   because they don't share the democratic
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.040]   principles of the rest of the G seven.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.360]   But we should be trying to any democracy
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.880]   that's in the bricks, we should be trying
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.280]   to include in the G seven that that's the
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.720]   strategic chessboard that would make the
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.000]   most sense. And then you would just leave
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.600]   bricks as all authoritarian dictators.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.160]   And they do not work well together. They
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.400]   always wind up
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.080]   growing. Brazil is still nominally a
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:47.880]   democracy.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.600]   No, that's what I'm saying. Like getting
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.440]   Brazil, I just said getting anybody who's
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.200]   a democracy and moving them towards
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.800]   democracy and getting them into the G
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   seven should be our stated goal. That's
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.760]   what the West should do.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.360]   Lula, who's Brazil's president is one of
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.760]   the most ardent advocates for
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.320]   de dollarization. Here's his quote, every
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.600]   night I asked myself why all countries
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.400]   have to base their trade on the dollar.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.080]   Yeah, they don't they can.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.240]   So maybe you can change him. J. Cal,
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.480]   maybe the CIA will get rid of them.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.320]   That's stupid. That's a stupid
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.200]   statement. Nobody's saying that I just
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:18.720]   said the exact
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.160]   there are people saying that, but
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.240]   oh, not me. Just to be clear, I get my
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.760]   mouth out of the exact opposite of what I
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.400]   just said. I said include my point is, my
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.200]   point is, this is not a simplistic
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.480]   dichotomy between dictators and
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.440]   democracies. Another way to
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.040]   assess. By the way, South Africa is
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.800]   just on a population basis. If you took
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.120]   India out and you got them into the G
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.880]   seven, it would be majority overwhelm
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.720]   majority percentage of citizens in the
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.640]   bricks living under authoritarian rule.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.040]   But India,
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.120]   let me respond to that. And then also
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.400]   tomorrow,
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.720]   and it is the largest country in the
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.000]   world. Now, I mean, this is the that's
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.040]   the strategic, important piece here, in
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.360]   my mind,
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.440]   I think India and the US will pull
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.160]   tighter together in terms of security
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.040]   because of a mutual desire to balance
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.680]   the power of China. So I think tomorrow
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.400]   is right about that. However, India also
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.160]   has a very strong anti colonial impetus
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.120]   to their politics, and especially their
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.320]   foreign policy. They do not like being
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.120]   told what to do by the West and the
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.240]   United States. And in particular, they
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.280]   do not believe in many of their
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.240]   politicians said this, we don't see why
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.720]   we should have to sacrifice for you,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.040]   we're going to do what's in the best
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.200]   interest of our own people. And that is
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.960]   why India has rejected enormous pressure
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.200]   from the US not to trade with Russia,
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.240]   India and Russia as bad as relationship
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.840]   is between India and China is the
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.640]   relationship between India and Russia is
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.960]   very strong. It historically always has
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.560]   been. And Russia right now is supplying
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.400]   half of India's oil. And India has
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.680]   adamantly refused to play along with the
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.800]   US sanctions, rightfully so. And
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.920]   rightfully so. Right. They should make
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.880]   their own best decisions. Right. So I
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.320]   think a lot of people are thinking that
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.040]   India is not here to be a bootlicker to
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   the United States. But that exactly,
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.320]   exactly. So look, I think India will
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.120]   pursue its interests. I think when it
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.960]   comes to security, they will align with
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.880]   the US to balance the power of China.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.200]   But I think when it comes to economic
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.400]   policy, India will pursue its own
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   interest, which I think has to do with
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.120]   maintaining their economic sovereignty.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.360]   100 cheap oil, they need cheap oil.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.520]   Yeah, they're developing country, right?
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:29.240]   They need they need oil. And that's the
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.000]   lowest priced oil.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.160]   Another way to think about the framing
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.760]   is that the priorities for many of these
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.440]   countries for the last two decades have
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.760]   shifted going from a state of economic
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.920]   insecurity, civil insecurity,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.600]   government insecurity. And as you
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.160]   obviously establish systems and
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.800]   certainty in certain elements, the
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.120]   dollar complex of sex frames it was
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.080]   very useful in helping them with that
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.880]   transition. But as they start to move
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.080]   from emerging market to developing
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.720]   market to developed market, the
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.080]   priorities start to shift. And then the
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.880]   priorities become much more about
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.360]   sovereignty, independence,
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.400]   institutional destiny, etc, that kind
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.040]   of start to make this more realistic
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.760]   that maybe they don't have their, their
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.040]   ducks in a row at this point. But
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.280]   there's certainly a conversation or a
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.080]   set of conversations that emerges when
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.600]   you're not worried about civil war, or
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.160]   you're not worried about economic
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.280]   strife. And you can now start to think
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.240]   on a global stage. And that's evidenced
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.280]   by the PPP data that that's actually
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.720]   where, you know, you've seen them
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.440]   become a much larger percentage of
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.800]   global GDP share over the past 10 or 20
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.000]   years, that's a good metric, or that
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.560]   general opportunity to say, hey, I'm
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.520]   going to shift my priorities now. And
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.760]   that's why maybe now's the time to
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.800]   start to pay attention to what's
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.280]   happening. And think about us policy to
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.080]   participate in, in some reconstruction
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.000]   that's necessary here.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.480]   I tell you what the most important
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.320]   here is all this con all these
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.640]   conversations seem to come back to
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.720]   energy Chamath, cheap oil, Russian oil,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.400]   Saudis, UAE all participating in BRICS.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.800]   And then if you look at nuclear, we
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.760]   just had a bunch of I think it was
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.880]   senators signing a bill, I think you
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.320]   might have tweeted it Chamath of
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.160]   support of nuclear 21 nuclear power
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.720]   plants are being attracted at this
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.640]   moment in China, eight in India,
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.200]   United States only has one, which is
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.520]   kind of an extension in good
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.680]   Gerard, actually nuclear,
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.000]   good driving, just injured, India just
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.040]   turned on its first home built one. So
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.120]   just literally today, so big, big news
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.080]   in India. If we really want to have a
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.480]   great relationship with India, an
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.840]   incredible path and with some of these
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.520]   other countries would be for us to
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.840]   really invest in these what I don't
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.480]   understand reactors and help people
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.840]   build them and help them get energy
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.560]   independence from Russia's oil, we
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.480]   should be building 50 reactors in
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.840]   India, I don't know enough. I don't
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.560]   know enough to know whether that's
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.120]   true or not. And part of it is that
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.560]   would like whether we should be
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.160]   building those reactors in quotes,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.640]   because I don't know what those means
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.920]   Gen two, Gen three, Gen four reactors,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.360]   any small modular reactors, my big
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.760]   comment in my thread is just more that
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.040]   I think that the regulatory support in
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.920]   the United States for nuclear is so
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.680]   constipated that it's impossible to get
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.640]   it done. So you could have the
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.440]   greatest technology in the world. I
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.960]   just don't see how the laws change
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.680]   fast enough and the zoning changes
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.600]   fast enough and the nimby ism goes
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.520]   away to make these things viable. And
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.320]   so that's actually the real question. I
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   don't know if you know,
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.280]   Freiberg States, what I'm advocating
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.160]   for here, Saks is, hey, what if the
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.640]   United States policy was we're going
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.480]   to help India and some other
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.080]   countries, they don't need our help.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.200]   They don't need our help. They just
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.840]   turned on their own homegrown nuclear
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.360]   reactor. We haven't done one in 20
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   years, but our new, I guess we call
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.840]   them Gen two, Freiburg. These these
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.760]   new reactors, would that not be a
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.320]   possible path if we're spitballing
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.240]   here to help them get more energy
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.320]   independence from Russia? Wouldn't
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.320]   that be a great long play?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.920]   They don't need our help. I don't
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.200]   think you're understanding like it's
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.280]   like you're saying we're, we're like
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.520]   Michael Jordan, and we're about to
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.720]   teach some kid how to throw free
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.960]   throws. This is not what's happening.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.240]   Any help would be helpful. I mean, if
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.720]   people are trying to build a large
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.080]   that's not correct. You don't you
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.360]   don't you don't need a numb nuts to
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.640]   come and help you build a product to
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.080]   you. You don't hire some two bit
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.360]   product manager to help you when
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   something is scaling and working.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.560]   India GDP is going to be 7% a year.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.920]   They're off to the races. They're on
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.200]   a rock ship. They're doing everything
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.440]   right. What what what can we do? We
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.480]   can help them rewrite their laws to
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.000]   make them Byzantine so nothing gets
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.080]   done. So that zoning is possible. Okay,
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.600]   as a strategy, if we had the ability
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.000]   to build nuclear reactors in other
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.640]   parts of the world, which is exactly
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.320]   China's policy, that's the belt. I
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.800]   think I think you in a nutshell right
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   now is summarizing why there's this
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.320]   dismissiveness, which is like we can
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.840]   help them. But what makes you think
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.400]   you're better?
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.960]   China is taking the same approach. I'm
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.800]   saying copy China strategy, which has
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.160]   been to go to other countries listen,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.880]   India might need less help. Other
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.920]   countries might need more. But we have
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.600]   this capacity. So what if we want
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.040]   capacity do we have? We don't have any
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   demonstrated capacity nuclear. We have
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.480]   plenty of companies building these new
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.640]   nuclear reactors freebirth. None of
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.200]   them work. None of them work. What are
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.320]   you talking about? What do you mean?
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.520]   None of them? None of them work. Okay.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.200]   None of them work.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.840]   When you talk to politicians in a lot
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.000]   of these countries, what you describe
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.680]   as Americans coming in and helping they
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.280]   describe as exploitation.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.200]   They call exactly China strategy or
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.320]   neo imperialism.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.960]   Yes, they call it neo imperialism or
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.000]   neo colonialism
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   at it as collaborating on energy
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.840]   independence, broadly speaking. So
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.200]   you're being
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.000]   too dismissive. I'm asking you to think
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.960]   of what you want. Do you want the
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.880]   Zimbabweans to fly in and mutually
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.040]   collaborate with you to build
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.240]   something in America? Would you be
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.720]   trying to make jokes about me? I'm
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.440]   proposing a joke. I'm just making it
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.680]   your joke. I have a very viable
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.440]   strategy here is, which is to look at
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.000]   what China is doing. And what China is
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.520]   doing the Belt and Road strategy, which
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.400]   we've talked about here on this
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.960]   program, is trying to help other
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.040]   countries get more energy. How could we
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.320]   do that? We do
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.120]   listen to what Larry Summers said,
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.120]   remember, he said that when China goes
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.440]   abroad, they give money for
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.400]   infrastructure, bridges and hospitals.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.080]   Yes. When the US goes abroad, we give a
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.680]   lecture,
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.840]   which is exactly
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.520]   stop this explosion of sanctions. We're
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.920]   now sanctioning dozens of countries.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.080]   Stop weaponizing the dollar, stop
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.200]   militarizing the dollar, stop seizing
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.360]   other countries, reserves without any
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:26.880]   due process.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   Talking about Russia, right?
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.000]   They're entitled to due process of law,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.240]   just like any other country,
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.880]   the country that invade their neighbor.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.800]   So you get just get to steal their
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.440]   reserves.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.040]   Oh, I think it's a
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.400]   rules based order.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.040]   Oh, I think you can just sanctions are
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.160]   much better than Yeah, starting a war.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.480]   Yeah, I think I can have sanctions.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.200]   We're talking about we're talking about
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.080]   the seizing of another country's foreign
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.360]   reserves, which is what the US did.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.280]   Yeah, I would say that's an extreme thing
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.720]   to do. Except in the case where people
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.360]   are invading other free countries, and
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.520]   then it's okay. So what you're doing
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.280]   right now is
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.800]   yet this is the way that the
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.840]   administration reacted. What you're
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.640]   doing right now is making up the rules.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.600]   That's what the rules based order means
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   to these countries, is that Americans
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.640]   will make up the rules. Two years ago,
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.800]   foreign reserves were something that was
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.200]   not part of American foreign policy.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.440]   They were your reserves. Then this
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.680]   Ukraine war happens by says, Nah, you
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.880]   know, those are ill gotten gain and
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.800]   seize them. Those are the new rules. In
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.640]   other words, the rules base international
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.920]   order is whatever Americans say it is.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.200]   And then you run around saying no, no,
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.360]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.160]   I made this decision together to
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.600]   sanction Russia. It wasn't just the US
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.520]   characterizing that. And you know what,
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.320]   if Hitler was invading other countries,
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.560]   or Putin or any dictator, I do think
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.920]   it's fair game to seize their rest of
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   the world does not buy into this
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.000]   narrative. 70% of the world does not buy
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.640]   into this narrative. They understand
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.680]   those are the US or
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.640]   and those are majority dictator
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.040]   countries. 70% of the world's
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.400]   population does not believe this
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.640]   narrative about the Ukraine war. They
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.840]   understand that the US is at least
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.880]   equally responsible for this war
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.920]   laughable to say the US is equally
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.400]   responsible. But that's what the rest
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.160]   of the country that is you are a
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.040]   spokesperson for Putin if you believe
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.400]   that that the US is responsible. Okay,
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.800]   you know what you can quote any
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.280]   polling you want. The US believe this
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.640]   the US is not 50% responsible for
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.040]   Putin invading Ukraine that is
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.520]   laughable and disgusting.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.560]   Every country, every country that
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.560]   wants to believe the US is 50%
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.160]   responsible for Putin invading
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.640]   Ukraine. Unbelievable. It's not
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.960]   about what I believe. It's about what
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.120]   the last thing you what you believe
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.280]   you said it. So do you believe 50%
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.480]   were 50% responsible for Putin
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   impending Ukraine? That's
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.480]   I don't know what percentages I would
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.080]   describe but I believe this war is
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.560]   easily you have 50% Can I finish my
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.720]   point? Go ahead.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.800]   The way you're acting right now is
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.480]   exactly why all these countries want
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.800]   to create bricks. They don't want to
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.080]   be subjected to this virtue signaling
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.000]   foreign policy by the United States.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.360]   We've discussed the ways many times
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.120]   the US could have avoided this war. It
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.280]   did it. Yeah, respectfully disagree.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.480]   Putin's responsible for the war. This
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.680]   is why India does not want to be
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.160]   subject to the whims of people like
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:19.520]   you.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.080]   Don't you don't see people like me, I
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.160]   think the West made the decision that
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.120]   we needed to take action against the
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.040]   US invasion. And listen, the West is,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.800]   we don't get to make decisions for the
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.040]   UK and France and Germany. We don't
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.960]   get to make their decisions.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.160]   Respectfully, they make their own
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.680]   decisions.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.320]   That's not really true. Okay, the US
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.720]   runs. I think they're selling to you.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.760]   The US runs NATO because we pay for
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.240]   it. All these countries go along with
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.160]   the US because they like the defense
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.280]   and security that we provide. The US
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.400]   calls the audience within the US
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.360]   calls the shots. So basically, a
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.240]   handful of people in the Biden
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.640]   administration, Biden, Newland,
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.520]   Blinken, Sullivan, that's who makes
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.080]   the policy. I do not and the rest of
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.240]   the world does not want to be subject
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.200]   to their whims.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.920]   I respectfully I don't think Biden
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.680]   gets to choose with Germany and France
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.960]   and the UK do.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.640]   Oh, I think Olaf Scholz is eventually
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.320]   gonna be voted out. And I think they
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.960]   should be voted out. I think there are
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.640]   people are waking up. But
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.280]   absolutely, they are the lapdogs, the
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.080]   United States.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.280]   We would like to go on to any other
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:22.800]   topics.

[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.640]   these parties. They're going to be
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.680]   outlandish. They're going to be out of
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.360]   control.

[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.640]   a film studio. So we have three
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.200]   warehouses at a film studio where we
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.480]   created part of the set of Blade Runner

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.760]   the weather is. It's gonna be warm. So

[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.800]   want just wear a trench coat over it.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.680]   Chamath if you're going to do a thirst

[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.760]   DJing again. So the dance floor will be
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.400]   lit just because we went well over the
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.280]   budget. We brought in some sponsors to
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.160]   help us cover the costs. I want to thank
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.360]   those sponsors I connections which is
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.560]   actually running the app that we're
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.240]   using to coordinate the summit. Our law
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.120]   firm that does the legal work for us
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.360]   Cooley has agreed to sponsor and there's
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.680]   a group of entrepreneurs from South
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.440]   Africa started a company called house of
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.120]   macadamia as they make macadamia nut
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.920]   snacks delicious. There's they're
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.560]   sponsoring and they you know why they
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.880]   reached out because Chamath and I eat
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.760]   salt and vinegar pistachio so they made
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.080]   a salt and vinegar macadamia bag in our
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.120]   honor I love it. Oh,
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.760]   I'm just in vinegar like this episode.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.480]   And then we've got a group called
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.880]   pavis which makes mineral based
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.920]   sunscreen. And obviously they heard us
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.320]   talking about sunscreen so they reached
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.760]   out and brew bird which makes a coffee
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.680]   brewing device came in and wanted to be
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.640]   a sponsor. So a lot of the sponsors came
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.120]   to us having heard about us talking
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.600]   about something on the show. And it was
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.880]   very helpful in helping us cover the
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.040]   cost of the event. So I want to say
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.480]   thank you to all of you guys. Thank
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.880]   thank you to all of your sponsors.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.280]   Thank you.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.240]   And then we're doing a high and low
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.000]   thing at where have incredible food
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.720]   trucks where we've elevated the food to
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.800]   like a higher level. And so we want to
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.000]   pair these food trucks with some nice
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.560]   wines. And so they sent you a list of
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.280]   all the different foods and then Bo is
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.760]   doing the steak at the first night.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.800]   Roku sushi really great sushi place in
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.200]   LA is doing the sushi the first night.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.840]   So we got some really great vendors and
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.200]   all the Asian street food in the
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.400]   Blade Runner party is gonna be great.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.440]   So Asian the last night steak and sushi
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.400]   the first night and then these elevated
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.120]   food trucks. So what is my year to do
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:13.440]   this?
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.200]   You're 20.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.360]   You're four. Yeah, I'm 24. You're 25.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.560]   I'm just gonna tell you in advance that
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.480]   I'm taking full complete control. You
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.840]   all you will have to do is show up. I
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.040]   don't want any intervention. I don't
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.440]   need to be moved. Please after this year
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.960]   and last year, I'd please leave me out
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.320]   of it. Great. I'm taking the sacks
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.680]   approach. I'm showing up. Where are you
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.160]   going to do it? Jason? I have three
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.360]   areas. The biggest grift. Brooklyn.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.120]   Exactly. Tokyo. Well, I'll take you
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.600]   through it. Brooklyn, my hometown is one
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.480]   so that's in my mind. My favorite city is
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.200]   Tokyo. You know, I love going to Japan.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.080]   So that's in my short list. And then on
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.760]   the griff side, UAE might be great. I
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.240]   have some partners there. And so that
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.440]   could be amazing to do it in Dubai as a
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:04:59.960]   huge
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.120]   I would be nuts. Dubai would be kind of
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.080]   crazy. My friend Andrew Sassoon is in
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.440]   charge of opening. I think it's the
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.000]   winds casino there. He's in charge of
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.400]   all the entertainment and nightlife.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.280]   That would be incredible. Sassoon can
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.800]   light it up in Dubai. I also took Europe
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   off the table because I had the sense
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.160]   that you might pick
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.720]   no, I may I may not I may go to Oman I
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.920]   make but I'm going to go to do a
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.680]   destination thing which is going to be
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.040]   yeah, everybody will stay in the same
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.440]   place. It'll be a much smaller number of
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.280]   people and it'll be end to end curated
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.120]   and 750 500 people. There'll be clothes
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.720]   there'll be everything. Okay, for the
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.000]   Sultan of science with the sunglasses on
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.720]   the dictator and the architect. We'll see
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.760]   you all next time on all in pockets.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.880]   Rain Man David
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:01.840]   we open source it to the fans and they've
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.640]   just gone crazy.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   Love you.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:03.840]   West.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.640]   I squeen of

[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.080]   just like this like sexual tension that
