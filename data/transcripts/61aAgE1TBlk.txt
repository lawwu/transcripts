[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.080]   We are gonna start this new week off
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.000]   with a solid Bible question
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   from a listener by the name of Andrew.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.040]   Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   My question is about who will judge the world finally?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.300]   Is it Jesus, the Father, or the Word of Christ?
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.720]   Of course, John 3:17 and John 12:47
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.160]   tell us that Jesus did not come into the world
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.180]   the first time to play the role of judge.
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.860]   I understand that, that comes later.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.840]   And as John 5:22 says it,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.620]   "It's not the Father who judges in the end, but Christ."
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.940]   But then other passages like 1 Peter 1:17
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.540]   seem to actually say, no, the Father judges in the end.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.660]   And then John 12, 48 and 49 says,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.620]   "Final judgment comes from the Word of Christ
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.420]   "under the authority of the Father."
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.320]   Can you help me understand all of this?
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   And in the end, who judges the world?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.760]   - I think if you put all the pieces
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.460]   of the New Testament together,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.840]   the answer goes something like this.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   It's kind of a complicated answer, but I'll unpack it.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.760]   God the Father judges the world
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.400]   through Jesus Christ, the God-man,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.360]   sharing that judgment in appropriate ways
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.440]   with apostles and Christians
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   and with the confirming indictments of sin and truth.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.540]   So that's the sentence that answers the question
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.320]   as I see all the pieces going together.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480]   But before I give the building blocks
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.920]   and unpack those pieces,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   let me say why I think this is worth talking about.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.320]   I mean, I think this is really important.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.120]   And the reason is because every single human being,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.620]   I just think of the listeners right now,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.620]   every single individual listening to our voices
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.020]   will be held personally accountable
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.720]   before the maker of the universe
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   for the way each of us has responded
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   to the measure of revelation
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   that each of us has concerning God,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.560]   concerning His ways in the world.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.080]   And for the way we have lived our lives,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.740]   including our attitudes and our words and our actions,
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.520]   in response to the witness of God in nature,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.120]   in scripture, in our own conscience,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.960]   which is just another witness to God's reality,
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   we will all stand before the judgment seat of God,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.720]   Paul says in Romans 14.10.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.800]   So that's why it matters.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   And I think there should be a kind of trembling seriousness
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.480]   about it over against the superficiality
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.240]   of most of what happens in the world.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   Now, here are the building blocks of that complex answer
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.960]   that I summed up in that sentence,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.720]   who judges the world.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   First, there are biblical passages that say plainly
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   that God judges the world, the Father judges the world.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.600]   1 Peter 1.17, if you call on Him as Father,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   who judges impartially according to each one's deeds,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.960]   conduct yourselves in fear
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.840]   throughout the time of your exile.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.480]   So there it is, clear.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   The Father judges impartially all of us.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   Or Romans 3.5, what should we say?
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us by no means,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.200]   for how then could God judge the world?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.120]   So that's the first building block,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   the Father judges the world.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   Here's the second one, you have biblical passages
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   about Christ judging the world.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   So 2 Timothy 4.1, Jesus Christ is the judge
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.200]   of the living and the dead,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   and by His appearing and His kingdom, He judges the world.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   So you have Christ at His second coming
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.560]   described as the judge of the living and the dead.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.760]   And then if you ask how these two threads
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.040]   of scriptures that talk about Christ
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.560]   and talk about the Father judging the world,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.840]   how they fit together, how those threads are woven
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   together, the clearest answer is that God the Father
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.040]   judges through God the Son, the God-Man, Christ Jesus.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.240]   And the New Testament expresses that relationship
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   between the Father and Son in different ways.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.400]   For example, Luke in the book of Acts expresses it
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   by saying God appointed Christ to be the judge of the world.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   Acts 10.42, Christ is the one appointed by God
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.920]   to be the judge of the living and the dead.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   Same thing in Acts 17, verse 31, God has fixed a day
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.080]   on which He will judge the world in righteousness
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.400]   by a man whom He has appointed,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   and of this He has given assurance
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.520]   by raising Him from the dead.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   That's about the clearest statement you could get
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.200]   of God judges by a man, Christ Jesus.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.880]   So God through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.120]   Then Jesus expresses this relationship
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.680]   between the Father and the Son in judgment
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.480]   with the same kind of emphasis,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.960]   with focus on the God-Man.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.720]   God intends to do His judging through a man,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   an incarnate Son, John 5.27.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.440]   The Father has given the Son authority to execute judgment
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.080]   because He is the Son of Man.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.000]   So I think when Jesus says in John 5.22,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.080]   which is just a few verses earlier,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   the Father judges no one but has given all judgment
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   to the Son that all may honor the Son
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.800]   just as they honor the Father.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.960]   I think when He says that, He doesn't mean
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   that the Father is not involved at all in judgment,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.760]   but that He's not involved in judgment without the Son.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.480]   The Father judges no one, I think means
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.200]   the Father judges no one apart from the Son.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.400]   And I say that because eight verses later,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.960]   this is John 5.30, Jesus says,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.440]   "I can do nothing on my own.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.680]   As I hear, I judge.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   And my judgment is just because I seek not my own will,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.280]   but the will of Him who sent me."
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   In other words, both God the Father
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   and God the Son say, "I don't judge anyone
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   without perfect harmony between my will
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   and my Father's will or my will and my Son's will."
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.560]   Now, besides the judgment of the world
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.800]   through the Father and the Son,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.400]   the New Testament also speaks of the involvement
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.520]   of the apostles and the saints
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.960]   in the judgment of the world.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.160]   This is really amazing.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   For example, Jesus says to the 12 apostles in Matthew 19.28,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.440]   "Truly I say to you, in the new world,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.880]   when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.440]   judging the 12 tribes of Israel."
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.920]   And then Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, verses two and three,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.680]   to the church, the whole church, he says,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.400]   "Do you not know that the saints, that is all Christians,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.240]   will judge the world?
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.520]   And if the world is to be judged by you,
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.600]   are you incompetent to try trivial cases here now?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.000]   Do you not know that we are to judge angels?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.760]   How much more than matters pertaining to this life?"
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.280]   Now, if that sounds incredible, which it does,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.120]   it gets even more incredible in Revelation 3.21
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.920]   where Jesus says, "The one who conquers,"
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.840]   that is the one who triumphs over persecution
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.560]   and temptation by keeping the faith,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.280]   the one who triumphs, the one who conquers by faith,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   "I will grant him to sit with me on my throne
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.480]   as I also conquered and sat down with my Father
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.640]   on His throne."
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.040]   That's just breathtaking.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.680]   In other words, to be part of Christ's people by faith,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   simple, childlike trust in the infinitely worthy Christ,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.680]   to be part of Christ's people, part of His body,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.560]   bride, is to be part of His rule.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.960]   That's what He said, part of His rule,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.320]   which includes part of His judgment.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.600]   So if we sit with Him on His throne,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.560]   in some sense sharing in His rule,
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   we then share in His judgment, just like Paul said.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.480]   Now, there are two more building blocks in that sentence
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.320]   that I gave.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.520]   So besides God, Christ, apostles, Christians,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.360]   listen to the way Jesus describes the judgment
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840]   in John 3:19.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.160]   "This is the judgment.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.440]   The light has come into the world
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   and people loved darkness rather than the light
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.000]   because their works were evil."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   In other words, it is our own sin,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.320]   our own love of darkness,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   which will be our judge at the last day.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.160]   And then He says in John 12, 48,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.020]   "The one who rejects me," Jesus says,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:10.020]   "The one who rejects me and does not receive my words
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.060]   has a judge.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.160]   The word that I have spoken will judge him
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   on the last day."
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.480]   In other words, at the last judgment,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.680]   the truth that Jesus spoke
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.220]   and that we knew and did not follow
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.040]   will rise up as our judge.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   So the truth and our sin will also be our judges.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.320]   Now, let me draw in one last cluster
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.520]   of a different kind of building block
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.040]   to use when we're building our biblical theology
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.680]   of divine judgment.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.680]   There are not only six judges, so to speak,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.400]   God, Christ, apostles, Christians, truth, sin.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.480]   There are at least six meanings of the word judgment.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.240]   And we should ask each time we're talking about it,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.520]   which one are we talking about?
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.480]   So judgment is an expression of the highest
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.200]   and final authoritative decision about our destiny
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.640]   by God, Romans 3, 6.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.120]   Judgment is an expression of the immediate execution
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.860]   of the act of judgment, Acts 17, 31.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.860]   Judgment is an act of final and decisive separation
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.460]   from God for non-Christians, that's Matthew 25, 32.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.460]   And judgment is an act of meeting out various rewards
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.060]   to Christians, 1 Corinthians 3, 15.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.020]   And judgment is an effect of truth
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.740]   that has been believed or rejected, John 12, 48.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.420]   And judgment is an effect of sin
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.860]   in response to truth, John 3, 19.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.860]   So we should always clarify what we're talking about
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.640]   when we ask about particular texts
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.860]   concerning God's judgment.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.860]   So to give the summary answer once more,
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.140]   who will judge the world?
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.980]   Answer, trying to put all the pieces together
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.640]   in one sentence.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.620]   God the Father judges the world
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.080]   through Jesus Christ, the God, man,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.460]   sharing that judgment in appropriate ways
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.380]   with apostles and Christians
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:54.260]   and with the confirming indictments of sin and truth.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.820]   And I think, Tony, that the note we should end on
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   is that the distinctive Christian reality,
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.040]   since lots of religions believe in the final judgment of God,
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.000]   nothing distinctively Christian about final judgment.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.560]   The distinctive Christian reality
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.680]   is that God's Son came into the world
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.720]   in order to take on Himself the judgment
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   that we deserve when He died on the cross
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   so that these words from Jesus in John
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.880]   would be gloriously true.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.520]   He said, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.200]   whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.920]   has eternal life.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.760]   He does not come in to judgment
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.160]   but has passed from death to life."
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   That's the distinctive Christian message.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.240]   - Yeah, very distinct.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this gospel reminder.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.560]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.960]   You can ask a question of your own,

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   And that mention of John 3:19 strikes me.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.680]   And this, and this is the judgment, Jesus said.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.560]   The light has come into the world
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.960]   and people loved the darkness rather than the light
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.420]   because their works were evil.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.880]   That's the judgment on sin.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.960]   Sinners love sin.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.880]   And I wanna press into that key point,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.120]   and we will next time.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.040]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.080]   Thanks for listening.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.660]   (upbeat music)
