[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Hannah, a listener to the podcast, writes in with a really good question for you.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. I have a Muslim friend and I aim for their salvation in this friendship,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   but I never share my weaknesses. Moral weaknesses, bad habits, even my own sin struggles.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I refrain out of fear that if I did share those things, this friend would see me and Christ in a bad light.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   My thought is, why should I talk about my weaknesses to an unbeliever since they can't help anyways?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Or, if I should, what is the goal and hope for telling this person my own weaknesses and struggles?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Can you help me think through this?"
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Hannah says that she avoids sharing her weaknesses with her Muslim friend or other unbelievers
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   out of fear that they will see her and Christ in a bad light.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   That is a real, appropriate, biblical concern.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Because the Bible repeatedly calls us to let our light shine that people might see our good deeds
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and give glory to our Father. So it's not wrong to want unbelievers to see us as doers of good
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   rather than moral failures. But alongside that concern, there needs to be put another concern,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   namely, communicating a false perfectionism and a view of the gospel that fails to revel in the promise
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   of ongoing forgiveness of sins and the justification of the ungodly.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So Hannah needs to steer a course between being indifferent to the demonstration of God's power,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   like it doesn't matter, on the one hand, and the communication of a gospel-minimizing perfectionism
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   on the other hand. So I would mention maybe four reasons why Hannah should, wisely and humbly,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   share with unbelievers, including her Muslim friend, her own struggles—struggles to trust,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   struggles to follow, struggles to obey Jesus and live a life consistent with His mercies
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and His promises and His Word. So first, she should do this because the Apostle Paul did it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He very openly said in 2 Corinthians 12 that a thorn was given to him in the flesh,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   a messenger of Satan, to harass him, to keep him from becoming conceited.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but He said,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   God said, Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That's why I thought of this passage—weakness—because she's worried about sharing weakness.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And here's Paul making much of his weakness for the sake of the glory of Christ.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So she needs to stir that in to her thinking. And in Romans 7, at the end—and yes,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I do believe Romans 7 is Christian experience in that debate—"Wretched man that I am,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   who will deliver me from this body of death?" And then he exults, "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And then he goes back down, "So then I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   In other words, when my flesh gets the upper hand, I serve the law of sin.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And he just so boldly lets it hang out. So Paul's example should set us free to speak of our brokenness
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and weakness, and I think even our struggle with sins, always being sensitive to what's appropriate
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   in every given situation. So that's the first reason.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Second, I think we should be willing to share our weaknesses with unbelievers,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   lest we give the impression of a false view of what it means to be converted to Christ
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and what it means to be sanctified. John says in 1 John 1:8, "If we say we have no sin,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   we deceive ourselves." Present tense. And the truth is not in us.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his truth is not in us.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Now many unbelievers—this has been my experience over the years—many unbelievers are kept back
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   from serious consideration of Christianity because they believe that the standard of behavior
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   that would be expected of them is inconceivable.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   On the one hand, they don't know anything about the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and on the other hand, they may have serious misconceptions about perfection
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and about the people that are Christian and what they're like.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And Hannah could help them have a clear view of conversion and of the Christian life
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   if she spoke about it in a realistic way in relationship to the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Third, we should be willing to speak about our weaknesses and struggles
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   because this will give hope to unbelievers that Christians are real people with real struggles
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   rather than a kind of superior moral race, which of course they know we're not anyway.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And lastly, fourth, we should be willing to share our weaknesses, even with unbelievers,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   in order to magnify the extraordinary grace and patience of God in Christ.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So Paul did this in 1 Timothy 1:16.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   He said, "I received mercy for this reason, that in me the foremost, Jesus Christ,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in me for eternal life."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So the point here is that the true nature of the gospel, the true nature of grace and mercy in Christ
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   are highlighted when we describe to unbelievers how precious forgiveness is to us
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and how precious God's patience is to us even when we're struggling after we're Christians to obey.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So I would conclude that Hannah should think through not just which weaknesses should be mentioned,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   but should also think through why Christ is precious to her in view of her weaknesses.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   In other words, talking about her weaknesses is not the point.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Talking about Christ and his patience and his grace and his value and preciousness in relationship to her weaknesses,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   that's the point. It's a way of talking about Christ.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So maybe she should just adjust the category question, not just should I talk about my weaknesses,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   but should I talk about the glories of Christ in relationship to my weaknesses.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So for those four reasons at least, I would encourage Hannah and all of us to make the truth about our lives
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   a means of celebrating the greatness of Christ.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   That's really good. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And Hannah, that's exactly the kind of question we're looking for in the inbox.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Thank you for sending that in.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And if you have a question for John Piper, send it to me through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And speaking of our dealings with non-Christians, we are going to close out the week with a doozy of a question.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   How do I wisely and humbly confront someone in my life who claims to be a believer,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   but who gives no evidence of this in their lives?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Wow. A huge question to be handled with pastoral care.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
