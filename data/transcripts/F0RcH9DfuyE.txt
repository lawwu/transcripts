[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Hi, I'm Jeremy Howard from Masks For All, and I've got a quick demonstration here about
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.600]   why it's so important that you wear a mask.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.500]   Your mask protects me.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.760]   My mask protects you.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   Here's how.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080]   When I speak, tiny droplets of water come out of my mouth.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.560]   And I am going to simulate that with a spray bottle.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.120]   It's not a perfect simulation because this is actually going to be a lot more spray and
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.880]   slightly larger droplets even than my talking.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.000]   But it's much closer than like an aerosol can, which is explicitly not what happens
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   when we talk.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200]   They just come out of our mouth at a fairly gentle rate.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.280]   So here's what could happen when I talk.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.080]   If I spray this close to the mirror here, then as I spray, you can see what happens.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.080]   If you zoom in here, you'll see little droplets up here.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.760]   So what happens if I step over here and try it with a mask?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.280]   So let's do the same thing now with a mask in front.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.520]   And this is the place here, and as you can see, zero droplets.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.400]   So if I show you this mask, this is the classic T-shirt mask, which actually I haven't even
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.200]   put the paper towel in the middle, which I often use.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.840]   And here's what happens if we use just a paper towel.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.020]   Again, if you have a look, no droplets coming through.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.840]   So as I said, this is not a perfect simulation of the micro droplets that come out when I
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.040]   speak, but it's the closest we can get without using special laser-based equipment, which
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.280]   is what the scientists who have also done this much better than I have used.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960]   But hopefully this explains why it is that if you're not wearing a mask, remember, you
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.720]   don't know if you're sick because you're most infectious in the early days when you have
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.760]   no or few symptoms.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.000]   So if you don't wear a mask, then those micro droplets are going on your family and your
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.100]   community members.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.640]   So please wear a mask when you make it home.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.160]   Thank you.
