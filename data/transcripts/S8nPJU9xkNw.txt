[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today is an Ask Me Anything or AMA episode,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880]   which is part of our premium subscriber content.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   which still comes out once a week, every Monday,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.460]   and of course is zero cost to consumer.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.960]   The premium channel is also designed to support
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   exciting research being done at major universities
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.940]   like Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.080]   research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.440]   for mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   in the near future.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   If you'd like to check out
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.500]   the premium channel subscription model,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160]   you can go to HubermanLab.com/premium,

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760]   you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500]   of this episode, and hopefully that will allow you
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.040]   to discern whether or not you would like
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.780]   to become a premium subscriber.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.760]   Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.080]   as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040]   Our first question is about motivation, in particular,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.700]   how to maintain motivation over long periods of time.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.440]   This was a question asked by Martin Zokov.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040]   He wrote, "I alternate between periods
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.820]   "of two different states that vary from a few weeks
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.360]   "to a couple of months.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.340]   "I have extremely high motivation in one state
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.680]   "where I can do multiple things, side projects,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.040]   "making music, as well as my main things,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   "or really low motivational states
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.140]   "where I can barely do anything,
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.280]   "and I only look for short-term entertainment."
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   I'm guessing short-term entertainment comes in the form
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.920]   of video games, social media,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   and just kind of doing generally unproductive things,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   as we all do from time to time.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.100]   He goes on to write, "What would be the best set
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.340]   "of protocols to normalize those extremes
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.160]   "into a more stable and consistent state?"
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.500]   Well, first off, this is an excellent question.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.320]   I say that because it's a question that I hear a lot,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.840]   and I think that many people are interested in knowing
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.080]   how motivated they ought to feel,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   and I think a lot of people also feel
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.140]   a lot less motivated than they would like.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.720]   Now, here, the question was specifically
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.800]   about how to not go from these extremes
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.880]   of days or weeks of high motivation
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.160]   to days or weeks of low motivation,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.080]   but before we do that, we need to take a step back
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   and acknowledge that just as with anxiety
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.820]   or happiness or sadness,
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.040]   we as human beings don't have an objective window
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.680]   into how other people experience motivation.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.300]   we don't even realize how we experience motivation.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.440]   We just know whether or not we feel a high barrier
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.220]   or a low barrier to leaning into work
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.080]   and getting things done.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.600]   In fact, I have a good friend who did many years
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.080]   in the special operations community
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.960]   and then went on to the finance community
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   and then now works in health and wellness community.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   He has a great kind of mental image for all of us to adopt.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.460]   It's certainly one that I've adopted,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.520]   which is for anything in our life,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   we can either be back on our heels,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.160]   flat-footed or forward center of mass.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.920]   Back on our heels, meaning really struggling,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.880]   flat-footed meaning that we're doing okay
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.040]   or forward center of mass,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.560]   meaning that we feel as if we're really tackling things
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.140]   and that we are in control of our environment
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.880]   or at least to some degree.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.440]   So I place that imagery in your mind
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.480]   because I'll return to it a little bit later in the question
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.920]   when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.340]   In the meantime, I want to remind everybody
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.840]   what the basis of motivation is.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.520]   Now, there are many neurochemicals and neural circuits
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.880]   involved in what we call motivation,
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.300]   but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.580]   is that the neuromodulator dopamine is involved.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.760]   Now, dopamine does other things besides control motivation.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   That is your eye.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.520]   It controls a number of different things
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.480]   in terms of movement.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.200]   It controls all sorts of things,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.020]   but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.880]   How do we know that?
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   Well, there are experiments on animals and humans
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.620]   which show that even in the absence of dopamine
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.800]   or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.040]   people and animals can still experience pleasure.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.200]   However, when dopamine levels are too low,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.480]   people's ability to pursue pleasure
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.640]   or their willingness to pursue pleasure,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.680]   in particular, their willingness to undergo effort
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.440]   not just pleasure, any goal of any kind,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.040]   is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.060]   So if dopamine levels are too low,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.340]   people simply will not put in the effort
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.560]   to obtain or reach a goal.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.840]   If dopamine levels are adequately high,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.220]   they will put in that effort.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.000]   And if dopamine levels go too high,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   you actually see something that is pathologic,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.680]   which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.360]   This is often seen in the manic phase
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.080]   of a manic bipolar person.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.760]   So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.280]   who's in the manic episode,
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.880]   dopamine levels are very, very high,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.700]   and they will think every idea is a great idea,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.440]   and they will have tons of energy to do that,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.000]   so much so that they're not sleeping.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.840]   So obviously that's not what we want.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.720]   What we want and what the question asker, Martin,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.440]   is asking about is how to keep dopamine levels
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.960]   in a range that allow us to lean into effort,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   but that we don't expend our ability to stay motivated.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.120]   And we can really trace that back to a biochemical/neural
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   circuit statement,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.920]   which is we really want to control our output of dopamine
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.080]   and the baseline levels of dopamine
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.400]   from which that output is taken.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   In other words, we want to think about dopamine
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.840]   as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.280]   That reservoir can be depleted, so it's exhaustible,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   it's depletable, but it's renewable as well.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.760]   And one of the best analogies that I've ever heard
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.320]   was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.620]   Dr. Kyle Gillette, who's a medical doctor,
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.640]   obesity specialist, expert in hormones.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.340]   We did a episode on optimizing hormones in males
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.240]   with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.400]   You can find that at HubermanLab.com
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.740]   or anywhere you can find podcasts.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.640]   Dr. Gillette offered an analogy
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.760]   of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wave pool.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.840]   And I really like this.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.320]   So if you think about this pool full of dopamine,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.100]   and here we're just talking about the dopamine
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.640]   that resides in the circuits of the brain
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.020]   that control motivation,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.320]   but that pool of dopamine you can imagine
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.480]   is just sitting there not doing much of anything
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680]   while you're asleep.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.820]   In fact, while you're sleeping,
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.640]   you're replenishing those dopamine levels.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.940]   I'll tell you another tool in a moment
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.800]   to replenish those dopamine levels.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.040]   But if you were to pursue a goal,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.680]   really, really go forward center of mass
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.640]   for many, many hours or many, many days in some cases
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.700]   and pursue a goal or multiple goals,
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.480]   and you're really driven to do a ton,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.740]   what you're effectively doing is generating waves
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.240]   in that wave pool.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.880]   And if those waves are too big,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.080]   well, then the waves can't keep repeating themselves.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.400]   So think about the wave as the motivation
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.480]   and the depth of the pool as the reservoir of dopamine.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.560]   And if those waves are too big,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.300]   too much excitement, too much motivation,
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.160]   too much center of mass for a given period of time,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.120]   then the water in this wave pool sloshes out
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.320]   of the wave pool, lowering the reservoir.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.800]   And then there are really three ways
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.520]   that you can replenish that reservoir.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   And you want to maintain or replenish that reservoir
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.760]   if it's been depleted.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.660]   How do you do that?
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.160]   Well, first of all, quality sleep.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.120]   So when I say quality,
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.660]   I mean where you're getting enough slow wave sleep
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.800]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.080]   So for some people, six hours,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   for some people, eight hours.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.520]   Some people might even need a little bit more
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.840]   or a little bit less.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.080]   We have episodes, the perfect your sleep episode,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   the master your sleep episode.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.320]   We have a toolkit for sleep,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.360]   all available at zero cost at Hubermanlab.com, links, et cetera.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.320]   So check those out for getting your sleep right.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.860]   But sleep is really when you replenish
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.400]   that reservoir of dopamine.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.440]   So you cannot ignore sleep.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.940]   I'll come back to this in a moment.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.460]   The second science supported tool
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.480]   that's really been shown to replenish dopamine,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.900]   in particular dopamine within the pathways
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.760]   that regulate motivation,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.900]   is a practice I've talked about before on the podcast
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.200]   called non-sleep deep breaths,
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.680]   sometimes called yoga nidra,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.440]   although yoga nidra is a little bit different.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.960]   There are two studies out of Denmark
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.320]   The first one simply involved
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.220]   having people do a yoga nidra practice.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.060]   Again, this doesn't involve any movement,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.560]   but it involves people, potentially you,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.220]   doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.440]   although there are now data showing
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   that as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.760]   AKA yoga nidra protocol,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.000]   leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.840]   in striatal dopamine reserves.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.480]   So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   This is why I'm such a fan of using NSDR, AKA yoga nidra,
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.660]   at least once a day,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.520]   and especially under times when you're engaging
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.960]   in a lot of high output.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.160]   And when I think, especially at times
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.020]   when you're engaging in a lot of high output,
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.800]   this is a mistake many people make.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.640]   They push, push, push, push, push.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.680]   They're in pursuit of a goal.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.040]   Then they hit that point where they're exhausted.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.880]   Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.360]   replenishing tools, such as yoga nidra or NSDR.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.240]   The real key is to always tap off that
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.600]   or refill that reservoir once a day
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.880]   before it's completely depleted.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.040]   Now, this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.660]   and the relevant circuits,
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.660]   but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.040]   think of it still as a wave pool,
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.300]   but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.940]   than it does of partial depletion.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.040]   So there's an asymmetry in the way this is done.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.480]   So it's not as if you drink a glass of water,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.120]   you fill the glass of water at a certain rate
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.800]   and it fills up to a certain level
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.820]   and the rate is constant.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.240]   Think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.400]   is depleted past a certain point,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.340]   it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep,
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.800]   much more NSDR, things of that sort
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   to replenish that reservoir.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.640]   Now, oftentimes what people will do
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.780]   when they start feeling less motivation
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.800]   is they will start relying on things like Adderall,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.700]   Ritalin, in some cases, illegal substances
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.920]   that can increase dopamine.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.760]   You know what those are.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.740]   Please don't ever lean to those.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.380]   They are extremely dangerous.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.420]   They really are because of their ability
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.120]   to potently release dopamine.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.280]   And guess what?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   Deplete that reservoir even further.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.560]   We've talked about some supplements on the podcast
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.120]   that can replenish dopamine, L-tyrosine in particular.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.720]   Macuna purines is actually 99% L-DOPA,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.400]   the precursor to dopamine.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.480]   I don't necessarily recommend Macuna purines.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.280]   It tends to make people very dopaminergic,
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.440]   drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, motivate it
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.880]   and then crash, again, depleting that pool.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.680]   L-tyrosine is a little bit milder,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.220]   but I really encourage people to lean first
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.500]   on the behavioral tools such as NSDR.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.980]   And by the way, there's a NSDR script,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.600]   totally zero cost that you can find
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.840]   by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.400]   That one works quite well
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.680]   if you're looking for a short NSDR.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.060]   There's some other NSDRs.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.400]   You can simply look on the internet or YouTube
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.720]   and just put NSDR and you'll find NSDR.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.080]   Or if you prefer to do
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.380]   the more classic yoga nidra type approach,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.120]   there are a lot of different yoga nidra options
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.920]   to choose from on YouTube.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.280]   Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.320]   are simply meditation with a body scan.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.880]   That's not true.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.920]   Meditation is a focus exercise, okay?
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.840]   Most meditations are focus exercise.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.800]   NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.540]   and newer data are starting to show
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.720]   that it can actually recover lost sleep,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.360]   so if you're not sleeping enough.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.580]   But to return to NSDR, aka yoga nidra, as a practice,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.360]   yes, it's been shown in laboratory studies in humans,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.680]   by the way, to restore dopamine levels.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.720]   There's another study, lesser known,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.060]   from that same group that was published in 2011,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.560]   which is entitled, "Dopaminergic stimulation
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.840]   "enhances confidence and accuracy
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.480]   "in seeing rapidly presented words."
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.380]   This was a cognitive task.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:16.240]   They explored yoga nidra, aka NSDR,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.360]   in the context of increasing striatal dopamine.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   They already knew that it did that, so that's great.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.020]   They confirmed that result.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.000]   But what they also found is that doing NSDR
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.200]   could restore confidence in cognitive ability
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.440]   and performance in these cognitive tasks, okay?
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.000]   So this is a really powerful, zero-cost tool
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve, okay?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.220]   So this is something to do every day,
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.720]   especially when you're not feeling depleted.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.360]   So the question, again, was about how to make sure
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.820]   that you don't go through these cycles of extreme motivation
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.160]   and then lesser motivation.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.400]   Well, get your sleep right.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   I would say 80% or more of the nights of your life.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.160]   Hopefully the nights that it's not good
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.900]   are for good reasons that you're enjoying yourself,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.480]   but hey, life happens.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.960]   So 100% of the time,
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.260]   it's just not reasonable to expect of yourself.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.320]   Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.580]   If you have the time to do 20, 30 minutes or an hour,
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.380]   you will see even more positive effects.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.020]   It has been shown in these research studies
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.840]   to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.000]   cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.280]   And I said there were three tools.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.460]   And the third tool that really can allow you
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.760]   to keep the dopamine AK motivation circuitry
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.520]   tuned up properly is to really start paying attention
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.380]   to peaks in dopamine and be very careful
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.160]   about layering in too many things
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.800]   that can stimulate the dopamine system.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.000]   I talked about this quite a bit
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.920]   in the episode that we did on ADHD
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.460]   and building and maintaining focus.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.600]   There are many things out there nowadays
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.880]   that will deplete the dopamine system.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.720]   For instance, and by the way,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.880]   none of what I'm about to list is necessarily bad.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.060]   I actually use some of these things.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.580]   For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.560]   that will allow whatever dopamine is available
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.700]   to be more potent.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.620]   Okay, so caffeine is great for some people,
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.940]   less good for people with anxiety.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.920]   Don't drink it too late in the day
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.640]   'cause it'll interfere with your sleep
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.200]   and so on and so forth.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   But many people will combine caffeine
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.120]   with music that they particularly like.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.960]   Music's great.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.500]   Music can stimulate dopamine release.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.180]   We know this, it can enhance motivation,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.240]   especially if it's the kind of music
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.280]   that really puts you in the groove
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.100]   for the particular type of work you're going to do.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.060]   For me, I like to listen to either loud, fast music
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.040]   or Glenn Gould classical piano, so one or the other.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.860]   I know what's right for me for a given time.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.880]   You'll know what's right for you
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.640]   for a given time in your preferences.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.040]   But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.760]   at higher and higher levels.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.280]   Again, caffeine isn't necessarily bad,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.120]   but they'll start doing that
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.180]   and they'll start layering it in
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.520]   or stacking very potent music, potent for them,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.500]   plus things like L-tyrosine.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.040]   Again, none of these things are terrible on their own.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.580]   In fact, they can be very beneficial.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.480]   Sometimes they'll start taking mucuna purine.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.580]   Sometimes they'll start relying on things like Adderall,
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.440]   Ritalin, and pretty soon what's happening
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.820]   is they're getting these big waves
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.160]   in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.760]   And within a few days, or maybe even within a few hours,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.660]   they're depleted and they're at that low.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.020]   And then as Dr. Anna Lemke, who was a guest on the podcast,
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.420]   talked about in terms of addiction,
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.920]   but also in her wonderful book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.440]   what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.560]   the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.120]   drops below its initial level.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.660]   So it's as if the reservoir got deeper and it's emptier
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.160]   and it takes much, much longer to fill.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.720]   Okay, so to be quite specific,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.880]   what I'm recommending is get your sleep right,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.140]   ideally every night of your life,
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.560]   but for as many nights of your life as possible.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.740]   That's clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.220]   Do all the things associated with that.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.680]   Morning sunlight, lack of artificial light
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.280]   at certain hours of the night, et cetera.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.620]   All of that's in the toolkit for sleep
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.780]   and other episodes I mentioned before.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.480]   Have a practice that is research-supported
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.040]   to replenish dopamine and incorporate that practice
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.880]   any time of day.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.480]   Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.680]   or middle of the night if you wake up
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.760]   and you need to get back to sleep.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.440]   It can be very beneficial for that,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.920]   but do it as a consistent practice
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.040]   so that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.940]   And as a third point, please be wary of,
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.000]   or at least aware of these peaks in dopamine
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and the fact that layering in a lot of things
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.080]   that stimulate dopamine,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.120]   well, that can be wonderful for your wedding,
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.320]   a birth of a new child,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.920]   going to a sports event with a bunch of friends,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.120]   celebrating a big anniversary.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.400]   Yes, please do celebrate
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.840]   and enjoy the wonderful events of life.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.960]   But please also understand and expect there will be a lull,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.760]   a sort of postpartum low,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.600]   maybe not full-blown depression, that follows that
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.020]   unless you incorporate some tools and practices
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.600]   to replenish that dopamine.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.440]   Does that mean you should never combine caffeine,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   L-tyrosine, music, and a workout in time with friends?
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.040]   No, absolutely not.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.680]   But don't expect to do that
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.640]   and then go do an intense bout of work
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.200]   and then get up the next morning and do it all over again
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.480]   for more than a few days
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.560]   before you find yourself pretty depleted, okay?
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.360]   So rather than give you a specific schedule
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.560]   of do seven days of this and four days of this,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.160]   what I encourage you to do
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.840]   is for at least five days a week,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.600]   maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.420]   maybe not.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.480]   But for at least five days a week,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.420]   get into a consistent routine
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.600]   that is, I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.920]   with how the dopamine,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.440]   AKA circuits that control motivation work.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.960]   And I assure you that you will find yourself
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.740]   in a more regular groove of focus and attention
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.960]   and alertness and motivation when you need to.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.160]   And provided you're doing all the things I described
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.680]   and hopefully paying attention to other things
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.640]   like nutrition and social connection too, of course,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.220]   you'll find a much more even pattern of motivation over time.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.600]   One last thing before I conclude the answer to this question.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.640]   When I was in graduate school,
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.540]   I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.460]   His name is Robert Knight.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.040]   He used to be at University of California, Berkeley.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.100]   I think he's retired now,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.160]   but is still active in the scientific community.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.820]   And I asked him what he was doing that weekend.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.780]   I don't know why this came up.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.900]   And he said, "Oh, I'm going fishing.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.860]   I like kind of mindless recreation."
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.700]   I said, "Well, that's great.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.840]   Fishing's fun, I'm not particularly into fishing myself,
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.740]   but I've done a few times and I enjoy it."
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.600]   And he said, "You know the most important thing
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.120]   for a science or medicine career or any demanding career?"
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.960]   I said, "What?"
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.060]   I was all ears, I was super hungry to get in the mix
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.700]   and do research and publish papers.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.620]   And he said, "Figure out how many hours a day
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.320]   you can do real work consistently."
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.420]   That means five days a week.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.860]   For some people, six or seven.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.940]   But five days a week, I think for most people,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.180]   it was going to be a bit healthier overall
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.940]   for your social life and family, et cetera.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.820]   And he said, "Figure that out and know that that number
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.180]   is what you should apply over and over and over again,
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.900]   but update that number about every four or five years."
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.100]   And I said, "Okay, so does that mean that over time
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.660]   I'm working more and more or less and less?"
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.480]   And he said, "Ah, here's the deal.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.920]   As you get better at your profession,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.320]   you will find that you can do more potent work,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   more directed work in a shorter amount of time,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.020]   but that does not mean that you can continue to expand
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.580]   the amount of time that you're doing focused work.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.840]   In fact, the opposite."
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.760]   So this follows a sort of general principle
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.420]   that's also present in resistance training,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.380]   weightlifting, right?
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.260]   The analogy there is that people always imagine
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.700]   that as you get better and better at resistance training,
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.120]   that you should do more and more volume,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   just keep adding volume.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.820]   And there's some evidence to support that,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.240]   more volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.280]   We've done episodes on this.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.500]   However, there's a different school of thought
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.800]   that works exceedingly well,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.480]   and it runs in the exact opposite direction,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.440]   which is as you get better
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.800]   at controlling muscular contractions,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.660]   or let's say for in an endurance sport,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.760]   as you get better at regulating your stride
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.240]   and breathing and all those things,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.480]   you actually can do more, quote unquote,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.340]   adaptation stimulating damage
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.800]   during a given training session.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.560]   So you want to train less, not more over time,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.680]   because beginners don't actually have the ability
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.660]   to get much done in a lot of time
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.040]   or a short period of time,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.240]   whereas experts can come in there and really nail it.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.920]   and it's something that I've followed throughout my career.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.360]   So at one period of my life,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.160]   I won't mention the hours that I worked in graduate school,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.980]   they were pretty insane, to be honest.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.380]   I had family members get a little concerned,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.880]   actually lived in the laboratory,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.600]   even as a junior professor.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.700]   I don't suggest people do that by the way,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.340]   but I enjoyed it at the time.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.220]   And the key thing is that you figure out
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.840]   what you can do consistently
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.120]   and still maintain mental health and physical health.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.480]   That's key as well.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.240]   And do that, and then every couple of years or so
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.000]   update that typically by reducing the total amount of time
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.940]   that you're doing that high potency work.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.000]   I think that combined with the other tools
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.760]   that I described before for generating
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.340]   ongoing dopaminergic circuits,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.440]   keeping that reservoir full,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   ought to give you consistent motivation.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.240]   Again, it's an art and a practice and a science,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.400]   so don't expect to get it perfect the first time around,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.360]   but I wish you all luck,
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.520]   and I'm certain that these tools work.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.120]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.040]   of this Ask Me Anything episode
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.400]   to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.020]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.280]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.520]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.640]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.840]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.080]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.920]   it's really twofold.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.840]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.320]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.380]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.060]   every Monday in full length,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.460]   we are not going to change the format
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.040]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.480]   and to fund research,
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.520]   in particular research done on human beings,
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.580]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.380]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.580]   that we are most interested in,
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   and we are going to specifically fund research
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.200]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.240]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.160]   and those protocols will be distributed
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.560]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.260]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.560]   and other media channels.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.160]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.360]   to your burning questions in depth,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.520]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.260]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.280]   in the first place.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.600]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.560]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.200]   to do a dollar for dollar match
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.120]   on all funds raised for research
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.840]   through the premium channel.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.320]   So this is a terrific way
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.040]   that they're going to amplify whatever funds
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.420]   come in through the premium channel
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.920]   to further support research
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.520]   for science and science-related tools
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.780]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.620]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.380]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.440]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.220]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.560]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.440]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.040]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.400]   that other people ask as well.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.360]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.160]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.080]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.280]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.620]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.960]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.380]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.040]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.940]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.800]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
