[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Of course, one can't demand that any of these woke guys be like intellectually self-consistent or
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.840]   even like say the same things from one year to another. But if one could, you know, you
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.120]   wonder what they think about these literally communist Chinese. I mean, these are literally
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.880]   communists. They're recycling huge parts of their GDP to help the poor. And so medicine is free.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   Everything, you know, education is free, right? They're literally socialists. They're literally
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.920]   communists. But in Chinese, the Chinese characters for eugenics is a totally positive thing. It's
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.320]   just like healthy production. It means healthy. Well, that's actually what it means in Greek too,
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.400]   but more or less. But the whole viewpoint on all this stuff is like 180 degrees off
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.840]   in East Asia compared to here. So go figure. Yeah, very based.
