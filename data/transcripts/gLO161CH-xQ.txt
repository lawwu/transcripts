[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   I think the best feeling transition when you're learning a skill is when you move from that second
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.260]   stage, the valley of despair, where you are consciously incompetent to then that slope
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.420]   of enlightenment, where your confidence goes up, your competence goes up, you're consciously
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.000]   competent. That is that transition where you start to see, Oh, wait a minute, I am actually
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.200]   doing better. And I feel better. But that's not the actual endpoint of learning or skill or
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.020]   confidence. That third phase, when you're consciously competent, you are better at this
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.820]   skill, but it still requires a lot of energy and focus and attention. Maybe you're getting
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.180]   a little bit more skilled at using more than one rewards credit card and really deliberately
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.560]   and strategically picking, which is the one I'm going to use for any given expense, because
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.980]   I know it's going to give me the highest bonus points earning for this activity, or maybe
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.420]   you're starting to learn how to do stacking, right? So you already feel really confident
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.740]   with which credit cards you're using. But now you also want to say, how can I optimize and
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.460]   maximize my points are even earning even more, maybe I'm also going to utilize an online shopping
