[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions old and new.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.400]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey or spice it up and make turkey tacos.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.100]   Serve up a go-to shrimp cocktail or use Simple Truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun risotto.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.400]   Make creamy mac and cheese or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection of Murray's cheese.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.800]   No matter how you shop, Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your holiday traditions.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.100]   Ralph's, fresh for everyone.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.500]   St. Swithin's College, Nottingham University, Newark-on-Trent, Nottingham.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.300]   October 21, 1934.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.400]   Professor Franklin Caldwell, care of British scientific expedition, Hilla, Mesopotamia.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.600]   My dear professor, the five clay tablets from your recent excavation in the ruins of Babylon
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900]   arrived on the same boat with your letter.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.100]   I have been fascinated no end and have spent many pleasant hours translating their inscriptions.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.200]   I should have answered your letter at once but delayed until I could complete the translations, which are attached.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.800]   The tablets arrived without damage thanks to your careful use of preservatives and excellent packing.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   You will be as astonished as we in the laboratory at the story they relate.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.900]   One expects the dim and distant past to speak of romance and adventure, Arabian Nights sort of things, you know.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700]   When instead it discloses the problem of a person named Dabasir to pay off his debts,
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.900]   one realizes that conditions upon this old world have not changed as much in 5,000 years as one might expect.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.200]   It's odd, you know, but these old inscriptions rather "rag me" as the students say.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.600]   Being a college professor, I'm supposed to be a thinking human being, possessing a working knowledge of most subjects.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.500]   Yet here comes this old chap out of the dust-covered ruins of Babylon to offer a way I had never heard of,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.400]   to pay off my debts and at the same time acquire gold to jingle in my wallet.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.300]   Pleasant thought, I say, and interesting to prove whether it will work as well nowadays as it did in old Babylon.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.600]   Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself are planning to try out his plan upon our own affairs, which could be much improved.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Wishing you the best of luck in your worthy undertaking and waiting eagerly another opportunity to assist,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.300]   I am yours sincerely, Alfred H. Shrewsbury, Department of Archaeology.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400]   Tablet number one.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Now when the moon becometh full, I, Dabasir, who am but recently returned from slavery in Syria,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.900]   with the determination to pay my many just debts and become a man of means worthy of respect in my native city of Babylon,
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.300]   do here engrave upon the clay a permanent record of my affairs to guide and assist me in carrying through my high desires.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.900]   Under the wise advice of my good friend Mathon, the gold lender,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.300]   I am determined to follow an exact plan that he doth say will lead any honorable man out of debt into means and self-respect.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.000]   This plan include three purposes which are my hope and desire.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   First, the plan doth provide for my future prosperity.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   Therefore, one tenth of all I earn shall be set aside as my own to keep, for Mathon speaketh wisely when he sayeth,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.500]   That man who keepeth in his purse both gold and silver that he need not spend is good to his family and loyal to his king.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.000]   The man who hath but a few coppers in his purse is indifferent to his family and indifferent to his king.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.400]   But the man who hath not in his purse is unkind to his family and is disloyal to his king, for his own heart is bitter.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.100]   Therefore, the man who wisheth to achieve must have coin that he may keep to jingle in his purse,
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.800]   that he have in his heart love for his family and loyalty to his king.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.900]   Second, the plan doth provide that I shall support and clothe my good wife who hath returned to me with loyalty from the house of her father.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.300]   For Mathon doth say that to take good care of a faithful wife putteth self-respect into the heart of a man
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.900]   and addeth strength and determination to his purposes.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.400]   Therefore, seven-tenths of all I earn shall be used to provide a home, clothes to wear, and food to eat,
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.300]   with a bit extra to spend, that our lives be not lacking in pleasure and enjoyment.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.100]   But he doth further enjoin the greatest care that we spend not greater than seven-tenths of what I earn for these worthy purposes.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.600]   Herein lieth the success of the plan.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.700]   I must live upon this portion and never use more, nor buy what I may not pay for out of this portion.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   Tablet number two.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.900]   Third, the plan doth provide that out of my earnings my debts shall be paid.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.800]   Therefore, each time the moon is full, two-tenths of all I have earned shall be divided honorably and fairly among those who have trusted me and to whom I am indebted.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.700]   Thus in due time will all my indebtedness be surely paid.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.600]   Therefore do I here engrave the name of every man to whom I am indebted, and the honest amount of my debt.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   Faroo, the cloth weaver, two silver, six copper.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Sinjar, the couchmaker, one silver.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.400]   Amar, my friend, three silver, one copper.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.800]   Zankar, my friend, four silver, seven copper.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   Askamir, my friend, one silver, three copper.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   Haransir, the jewel-maker, six silver, two copper.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.300]   Diyarbekir, my father's friend, four silver, one copper.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.600]   Al-Kahad, the house-owner, fourteen silver.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800]   Maithon, the gold-lender, nine silver.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.000]   Birajik, the farmer, one silver, seven copper.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   From here on, disintegrated, cannot be deciphered.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.700]   Tablet number three.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.900]   To these creditors do I owe in total 119 pieces of silver and 141 pieces of copper.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.600]   Because I did owe these sums and saw no way to repay, in my folly I did permit my wife to return to her father,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.200]   and did leave my native city and seek easy wealth elsewhere,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.500]   only to find disaster and to see myself sold into the degradation of slavery.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.200]   Now that Maithon doth show me how I can repay my debts in small sums of my earnings,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.600]   do I realize the great extent of my folly in running away from the results of my extravagances.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.900]   Therefore have I visited my creditors and explained to them that I have no resources with which to pay except my ability to earn,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.200]   and that I intend to apply two-tenths of all I earn upon my indebtedness evenly and honestly.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.300]   This much can I pay, but no more.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.400]   Therefore, if they be patient, in time my obligations will be paid in full.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.800]   Achmar, whom I thought my best friend, reviled me bitterly, and I left him in humiliation.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.500]   Birajik, the farmer, pleaded that I pay him first, as he didst badly need help.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.800]   Al-Kahad, the house owner, was indeed disagreeable,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   and insisted that he would make me trouble unless I didst soon settle in full with him.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.900]   All the rest willingly accepted my proposal.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.000]   Therefore am I more determined than ever to carry through,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.400]   being convinced that it is easier to pay one's just debts than to avoid them.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   Even though I cannot meet the needs and demands of a few of my creditors, I will deal impartially with all.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000]   Tablet number four.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.900]   Again the moon shines full.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.000]   I have worked hard with a free mind.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.500]   My good wife hath supported my intentions to pay my creditors.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.900]   Because of our wise determination, I have earned, during the past moon,
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.100]   buying camels of sound wind and good legs, for Neybatur the sum of nineteen pieces of silver.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.200]   This I have divided according to the plan.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.600]   One-tenth have I set aside to keep as my own.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.200]   Seven-tenths have I divided with my good wife to pay for our living.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.100]   Two-tenths have I divided among my creditors as evenly as could be done in coppers.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.400]   I did not see Achmar, but left it with his wife.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.100]   Birajik was so pleased he would kiss my hand.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.000]   Old Al-Kahad alone was grouchy and said I must pay faster,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.500]   to which I replied that if I were permitted to be well-fed and not worried,
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.100]   that alone would enable me to pay faster.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.200]   All the others thanked me and spoke well of my efforts.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.800]   Therefore, at the end of one moon, my indebtedness is reduced by almost four pieces of silver,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.500]   and I possess almost two pieces of silver besides, upon which no man hath claim.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.200]   My heart is lighter than it hath been for a long time.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.300]   Again the moon shines full.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.800]   I have worked hard, but with poor success.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.100]   Few camels have I been able to buy.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.800]   Only eleven pieces of silver have I earned.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.400]   Nevertheless, my good wife and I have stood by the plan,
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.300]   even though we have bought no new raiment and eaten little but herbs.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.500]   Again I paid ourselves one-tenth of the eleven pieces, while we lived upon seven-tenths.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   I was surprised when Achmar commended my payment, even though small.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.000]   So did Birajik.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.900]   Al-Kahad flew into a rage,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.900]   but when told to give back his portion if he did not wish it, he became reconciled.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.900]   The others, as before, were content.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.000]   Again the moon shines full, and I am greatly rejoiced.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   I intercepted a fine herd of camels and bought many sound ones.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Therefore, my earnings were forty-two pieces of silver.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.200]   This moon my wife and myself have bought much-needed sandals and raiment.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   Also, we have dined well on meat and fowl.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   More than eight pieces of silver we have paid to our creditors.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.900]   Even Al-Kahad did not protest.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.400]   Great is the plan, for it leadeth us out of debt and giveth us wealth, which is ours to keep.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.600]   Three times the moon had been full since I last carved upon this clay.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.100]   Each time I paid to myself one-tenth of all I earned.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.200]   Each time my good wife and I have lived upon seven-tenths, even though at times it was difficult.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.500]   Each time have I paid to my creditors two-tenths.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.900]   In my purse I now have twenty-one pieces of silver that are mine.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.100]   It maketh my head to stand straight upon my shoulders and maketh me proud to walk among my friends.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.300]   My wife keepeth well our home, and it is becomingly gowned.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.200]   We are happy to live together.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.400]   The plan is of untold value.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.600]   Hath it not made an honorable man of an ex-slave?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.100]   Tablet number five.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.800]   Again the moon shines full, and I remember that it is long since I carved upon the clay.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.400]   Twelve moons in truth have come and gone.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.600]   But this day I will not neglect my record, because upon this day I have paid the last of my debts.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.000]   This is the day upon which my good wife and my thankful self celebrate with great feasting
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   that our determination hath been achieved.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.100]   Many things occurred upon my final visit to my creditors that I shall long remember.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.100]   Ahmar begged my forgiveness for his unkind words,
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.300]   and said that I was one of all others he most desired for a friend.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.600]   Old Al-Qahad is not so bad after all, for he said,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.100]   "Thou wert once a piece of soft clay to be pressed and molded by any hand that touched thee.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.800]   But now thou art a piece of bronze capable of holding an edge.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   If thou needest silver or gold at any time, come to me."
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.500]   Nor is he the only one who holdeth me in high regard.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.300]   Many others speak deferentially to me.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.900]   My good wife looketh upon me with a light in her eyes that doth make a man have confidence in himself.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.800]   Yet it is the plan that hath made my success.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   It hath enabled me to pay all my debts and to jingle both gold and silver in my purse.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.200]   I do commend it to all who wish to get ahead.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   For truly, if it will enable an ex-slave to pay his debts and have gold in his purse,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.900]   will it not aid any man to find independence?
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.100]   Nor am I myself finished with it, for I am convinced that if I follow it further,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.300]   it will make me rich among men.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.400]   St. Swithin's College, Nottingham University, Newark-on-Trent, Nottingham, November 7th, 1936.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.900]   Professor Franklin Caldwell, carer of British scientific expedition, Hilla, Mesopotamia.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:03.100]   "My dear professor, if in your further digging into those ruins of Babylon you encounter the ghost of a former resident,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.100]   an old camel trader named Dabaseer, do me a favor.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.700]   Tell him that his scribbling upon those clay tablets so long ago
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   has earned for him the lifelong gratitude of a couple of college folks back here in England.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.500]   You will possibly remember my writing a year ago that Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.700]   intended to try his plan for getting out of debt and at the same time having gold to jingle.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.800]   You may have guessed, even though we tried to keep it from our friends, our desperate straits.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.500]   We were frightfully humiliated for years by a lot of old debts and worried sick for fear
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.400]   some of the tradespeople might start a scandal that would force me out of the college.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:43.100]   We paid and paid every shilling we could squeeze out of income, but it was hardly enough to hold things even.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.900]   Besides, we were forced to do all our buying where we could get further credit regardless of higher costs.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.400]   It developed into one of those vicious circles that grow worse instead of better.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.500]   Our struggles were getting hopeless. We could not move to less costly rooms because we owed the landlord.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.300]   There did not appear to be anything we could do to improve our situation.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.500]   Then, here comes your acquaintance, the old camel trader from Babylon,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.600]   with a plan to do just what we wished to accomplish.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:16.300]   He jolly well stirred us up to follow his system. We made a list of all our debts and I took it around and showed it to everyone we owed.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.000]   I explained how it was simply impossible for me to ever pay them the way things were going along.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   They could readily see this themselves from the figures.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Then I explained that the only way I saw to pay in full was to set aside 20% of my income each month to be divided pro rata,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   which would pay them in full in a little over two years.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   That, in the meantime, we would go on a cash basis and give them the further benefit of our cash purchases.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.500]   They were really quite decent. Our green grocer, a wise old chap, put it in a way that helped to bring around the rest.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   If you pay for all you buy and then pay some on what you owe, that is better than you have done,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.900]   for you ain't paid down the account none in three years.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:02.000]   Finally, I secured all their names to an agreement binding them not to molest us as long as the 20% of income was paid regularly.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.500]   Then we began scheming on how to live upon 70%.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   We were determined to keep that extra 10% to jingle.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.000]   The thought of silver and possibly gold was most alluring.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It was like having an adventure to make the change.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   We enjoyed figuring this way and that to live comfortably upon that remaining 70%.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   We started with rent and managed to secure a fair reduction.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.500]   Next, we put our favorite brands of tea and such under suspicion,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   and were agreeably surprised how often we could purchase superior qualities at less cost.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   It is too long a story for a letter, but anyhow it did not prove difficult.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.500]   We managed and write cheerfully at that.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:45.000]   What a relief it proved to have our affairs in such a shape we were no longer persecuted by past due accounts.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.500]   I must not neglect, however, to tell you about that extra 10% we were supposed to jingle.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.000]   Well, we did jingle it for some time. Now don't laugh too soon.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   You see, that is the sporty part.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   It is the real fun to start accumulating money that you do not want to spend.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   There is more pleasure in running up such a surplus than there could be in spending it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   After we had jingled to our heart's content, we found a more profitable use for it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.500]   We took up an investment upon which we could pay that 10% each month.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.000]   This is proving to be the most satisfying part of our regeneration.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.500]   It is the first thing we pay out of my check.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.000]   There is a most gratifying sense of security to know our investment is growing steadily.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.500]   By the time my teaching days are over, it should be a snug sum,
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   large enough so the income will take care of us from then on.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.000]   All this out of my same old check.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.500]   Difficult to believe, yet absolutely true.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.000]   All our debts being gradually paid and at the same time our investment increasing.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Besides, we get along financially even better than before.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Who would believe there could be such a difference in results between following a financial plan and just drifting along.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.500]   At the end of the next year, when all our old bills shall have been paid,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.000]   we will have more to pay upon our investment besides some extra for travel.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   We are determined never again to permit our living expenses to exceed 70% of our income.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Now you can understand why we would like to extend our personal thanks to that old chap whose plan saved us from our hell on earth.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.500]   He knew. He had been through it all.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   He wanted others to benefit from his own bitter experiences.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   That is why he spent tedious hours carving his message upon the clay.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.000]   He had a real message for fellow sufferers.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   A message so important that after 5,000 years it has risen out of the ruins of Babylon,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   just as true and just as vital as the day it was buried.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Yours sincerely, Alfred H. Shrewsbury, Department of Archaeology.
