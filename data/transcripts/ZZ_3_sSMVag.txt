[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.460]   Deny yourself, and then what?
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.260]   Take up your cross.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.900]   This is a living illustration of Luke 9, 23.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.840]   Do you love me enough to deny yourself?
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.720]   Do you love me enough to take up a cross, if that's what I ask?
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.880]   Love that sacrifices in the face of death is love that obeys in life.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.720]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.220]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:01:07.200]   Not too long ago, I completed preaching through the gospel.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500]   The gospel of John.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.480]   For 116 weeks, I prepared hour upon hour, day upon day, and preached maybe a tenth of
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.000]   what was in my heart at the end of each week of study.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.020]   I lived for 116 weeks in the gospel of John, in the glory of Christ.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.440]   Somebody said to me when I finished the gospel of John,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.040]   "Don't you feel good that it's over?"
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   I said, "No, I really feel sad that it's over."
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   John records His marvelous words, His miraculous works, culminating in His death and His bodily
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.040]   resurrection followed by His appearances.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.360]   And John brings his gospel to its great climax.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   Open your Bible to the 20th chapter.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.120]   Verses 30 and 31.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:23.420]   John sums it all up by saying, "Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200]   presence of the disciples."
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   In fact, there were so many that in the last verse of John, he actually says, "The world,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Christ, is the world."
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   The world.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   The world.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.880]   Couldn't contain the books that could be written on everything He did.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.560]   Many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.000]   in this book, but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.880]   Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.800]   The gospel of John.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.560]   The gospel of John is to provide evidence for the deity and Messiahship of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.500]   evidence that leads you to believe and have eternal life.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.620]   That's the high point of the gospel of John.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.400]   That's the pinnacle.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.800]   And when I hit that verse, I thought, "That should be the end.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.540]   That should be the end."
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.260]   But it isn't.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.360]   From the heights of that elevated summation of the evidential and evangelistic purposes
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:59.120]   of the gospel of John, from that elevated, glorious revelation of the risen Christ, we
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.800]   come to chapter 21, and it's like being dropped off a cliff.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.900]   Dropped off a cliff and landing with a thud.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.020]   It's because with all the glory that has come through to the end of chapter 20, eventually
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.000]   that glory ends up in clay pots.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.960]   This is for us.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.040]   This has to be part of the story.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.400]   We are to carry the glorious gospel forward, even in our frailty and our weakness.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:45.460]   Peter did enough things to lose his ordination papers.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.760]   If he had presented his testimony as an application to the Master's seminary, he likely would
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.400]   have been rejected.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.000]   Occasionally speaks for the devil.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.900]   Occasionally pulls Jesus aside and tells Him what to do.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.000]   And when it gets tough, he denies and denies and denies that he ever knows the Lord, and
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.380]   then swears.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.720]   Oh, that's great stuff for a minister.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.000]   The thud takes place in the first three words of verse 1: "After these things."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.580]   "After these things."
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.760]   Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.700]   Himself in this way: "Simon, Peter, and Thomas called Didymus the twin, and Nathanael of Cana
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.940]   in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee would be James and John, two other disciples, Philip
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.940]   and Andrew."
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.540]   What you've got here is all the people who were in the fishing business.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.400]   These are all the Galilean fishermen, and you can throw in Thomas.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   Pretty startling here.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.600]   "Simon, Peter said to them, 'I'm going fishing.'"
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.460]   Why does Peter do this?
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.360]   Why does he say, "I'm going back to fishing"?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   Hasn't he seen the risen Christ?
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.060]   Yes, yes.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.420]   Why is he going back to fishing?
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.800]   I think the answer is pretty simple: he had absolutely no confidence in himself.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.080]   He was a proven failure.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.360]   One minute he could be serving the Lord, and the next minute the devil.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.660]   He could say, "I'll follow you even to death."
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.700]   And then when all he had to do was confess Christ, he would deny Him, and deny Him, and
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.960]   deny Him, and deny Him to irrelevant people in the dark.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.600]   At that part of the story, we don't know if he's any different than Judas.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:13.920]   Full of self-doubt, sense of serious overwhelming weakness, a history of failure, lack of trust
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.720]   in himself, inadequate.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.980]   "I can't do this.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:27.020]   I can't do this ministry, but I can fish."
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.400]   Let's go back to fishing.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:40.280]   Verse 4: "But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.600]   didn't know it was Jesus.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:51.660]   So Jesus said to them, 'Children, you do not have any fish, do you?'"
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.880]   That is irritating, even if it's Jesus.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.200]   That is - you really don't need to punctuate that.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:11.540]   And they said, "No."
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.000]   This wasn't the first time this happened.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.580]   This had happened earlier in Luke 5.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.040]   And do you remember on that occasion when Peter realized it was the Lord, what was his
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.440]   response?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.000]   "Lord, go away from me."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.060]   "Go away from me, for I am a sinful man."
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:45.660]   Here he was again, the same sinful man in the presence of the same Son of God.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.840]   And when the Lord said, "You don't have any fish, do you?"
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.460]   He was saying this: "You can't fish anymore.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.800]   I control the fish."
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.500]   "You can't catch fish.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.300]   I called you to catch men."
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.720]   "No, no, no.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.040]   No, no, that was just a coincidence.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   You know, they were in a bad spot.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.300]   It was just a coincidence, really.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.860]   Look at verse 6.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.260]   "He said to them, 'Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you'll find a catch.'
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.460]   So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.300]   of fish."
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.320]   There were no fish in the area.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.440]   And when the Lord said to them, "Pride the right side of the boat," - you know, your
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.480]   instinct would be to say, "What, is he crazy?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.520]   Do you think we fished off one side or the boat stays in one spot?
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   What are you talking about?"
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.160]   But the authority in His voice caused them to do what they did, even though at this point
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.060]   they didn't know who it was.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.520]   So they cast the net on the right side of the boat.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.560]   He said, "You'll find a catch."
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.920]   They cast; they weren't even able to haul the catch in because of the great number of
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   fish.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:13.160]   "Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved," - namely John - "said to Peter, 'It is the
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.040]   Lord!'"
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.180]   This is the final miracle in the gospel of John.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.860]   When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.360]   of the work, and threw himself into the sea.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:43.540]   This is so Peter, just so totally out of control and impulsive.
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:49.080]   He doesn't help the guys who are trying to haul in this massive amount of fish.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.660]   He just dives in the water.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:09.620]   While he's thrown himself into the sea, the other disciples came in the little boat, big
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.160]   enough to hold all of them, not far from land, about a hundred yards, dragging the
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   net full of fish.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.540]   They couldn't get it in the boat.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:26.460]   So they're working like crazy to get the fish to the shore.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:33.720]   Finally got to the land in verse 9, "saw a charcoal fire already laid, and fish placed
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.240]   on it and bred."
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.960]   And Jesus said, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught."
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.840]   We'll add that.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.640]   Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of large fish, 153.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.900]   I love the number.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.420]   It's an eyewitness account of a number.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.260]   They counted them, and it's an indication this is a real miracle.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.300]   And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:12.720]   It's just kind of a modest miracle, massive catch without tearing the net.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:20.120]   Now that Peter and the others know, they can't fish anymore.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   That's the lesson.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.700]   You can't fish.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.060]   I control the fish.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:34.420]   You can't fish for fish when Matthew 4:19, "You've been called to fish for men."
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.500]   And then the Lord does an amazing thing.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:45.100]   He moves for the restoration of Peter and the others.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:55.860]   Now are you surprised that the Lord would restart these reluctant, weak disciples?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:06.500]   How does Jesus - here's the question: How does Jesus disciple a disciple?
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   You all are involved in discipleship?
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.320]   How does Jesus disciple a disciple?
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.360]   How does Jesus restore a disobedient disciple?
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:25.660]   How does Jesus do biblical counseling?
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.000]   How does Jesus shepherd a wayward sheep?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.120]   How does He pastor them?
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.200]   How does He lead them to sanctification and obedience?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.280]   How does He recover them for usefulness?
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:48.040]   It must be a long and very complex process.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.480]   It's going to take months, if not years.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.700]   How does He do it?
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.460]   How does Jesus do it?
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.920]   Jesus, Disciple, a disobedient Disciple.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.700]   You ready?
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:17.320]   He asks Him one question, three times: "Do you love Me?"
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.300]   The motive for all your sanctification and the motive for all your service is this simple:
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   Do you love Me?
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.460]   "Do you love Me more than the stuff that made up your life?"
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.480]   Which is like saying, "If any man will come after Me, let him" - what?
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.140]   "Deny himself."
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.920]   You've got to let go of everything.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.120]   You say, "That's a sad admission."
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.800]   Well, isn't it kind of sad to have to depend on omniscience?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:54.060]   I mean, it isn't even obvious you've got to call on omniscience.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.380]   He didn't say, "Lord, You've seen my life."
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.380]   Isn't it obvious?
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.040]   No.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:11.600]   He said, "I have to call on Your omniscience, and You know that I have deep affection for
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.100]   You."
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:22.740]   The Lord says to him, "Basque My lambs, shepherd My lambs."
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.820]   This is His ordination.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.580]   You're accepted.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.460]   Really.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.440]   After all the ridiculous things that Peter has done - and here's just previous to this
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:42.940]   another evidence of his impulsive disobedience - He puts him right back in the ministry:
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.580]   "Feed My lambs."
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:53.580]   I would just tell you to look at the pronoun here, personal pronoun.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.620]   "Feed My lambs."
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.660]   I'm going to tell you that this is the word that I'm going to use.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   And this is the word that I'm going to use.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.660]   I'm going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.660]   I'm going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   I'm going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.660]   I'm going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660]   He's going to say, "Feed My lambs."
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:21.340]   to the ministry, with a love that isn't even visible to anyone except the Lord in His omniscience.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:33.360]   "Feed My lambs, My little ones, young, tender, weak, vulnerable, prone to wander, prone to
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:41.180]   stray. Do you love Me?" - agapao . He said to him, "Yes, Lord, You know that I love
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:52.940]   you." And he said, "Okay." - poimaino - "Shepherd My sheep." Third time, he said to him the
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:17:00.980]   third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" And this time he dropped down to Peter's
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.480]   word.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.360]   "I love You."
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.980]   And he questioned even the lower-level love that Peter thought he could get away with.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:26.020]   "Do you really have strong affection for Me?" This really hurt. This probes into Peter's
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:32.480]   heart. This is a spiritual biopsy, cuts some of Peter's soul open.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:49.240]   And Peter was grieved - lupao - to have a pain, a deep pain or grief in the heart. Not
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:56.620]   because it was the third time. He needed three times. After all, he had denied the
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:05.020]   Lord three times. It wasn't because it was the third time; it was because the third time
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:14.660]   the Lord questioned even the love that he thought he could get by with.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:22.620]   And again he calls on omniscience. He said to him, "Lord, You know all things. You know
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.620]   that I love You."
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.620]   - poimaino - "Shepherd My sheep." Jesus said, "Do you love Me?" - poimaino - "Shepherd My
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:33.880]   sheep." Jesus said to him, "Tend My sheep."
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:45.740]   Now this love has a cost. Verse 18: "Okay, Peter, you love Me? Truly, truly, I say to you" - twenty-five
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:52.620]   times in the gospel of John we have that little formula, meaning something very important. This is a verbal call to attention.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:19:00.200]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself, put on
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:09.700]   your own clothes, walk wherever you wished, did what you wanted. But when you grow old,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.960]   you will stretch out your hands."
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:21.340]   What in the world does that mean? It's a euphemism for crucifixion. "When you're old, you're
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.220]   going to stretch out your hands, and someone else will gird you and bring you where you
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:32.680]   do not wish to go." How do you know it's His crucifixion? Because the next statement is,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.820]   He said this signifying by what kind of death He would glorify God. History tells us He
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:48.300]   was crucified. Deny yourself, and then what? Take up your cross. This is a living illustration
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.920]   of Luke 9:23.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:20:02.140]   "Do you love Me? Do you love Me enough to deny yourself? Do you love Me enough to take
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:15.280]   up a cross, if that's what I ask? Do you love Me that much?" There's one other component.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.500]   This is love that not only demands a sacrifice, but it demands obedience. Look at verse
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:28.580]   19 again: "And when He had spoken this, He said to him, 'Follow Me.'" Again, those are
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.620]   the three components of Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself, take up your cross, follow Me."
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:44.460]   That's what it means to be a disciple. He says, "Follow Me." Love that sacrifices in
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:50.080]   the face of death is love that obeys in life.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:21:00.860]   But like everything else with Peter, everything is hard, everything. Verse 20, the Lord says,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:10.920]   "Follow Me." Next statement: "Peter turning around. Give Me a break."
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:22.560]   This is impossible. "Give, move down one notch to Andrew or somebody else." Are you
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:36.320]   kidding me? "He turns around." He can't take one step following. "And he saw the disciple
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.800]   whom Jesus loved." John never calls himself by his name. "Why would he do that? Why would
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:51.240]   he when he can call himself the disciple whom Jesus loved?"
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.600]   He turns around and he sees John, the one who not only is the disciple whom Jesus loved,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.740]   but who also leaned back on his bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.860]   betrays You?" John just, he can't get over the fact of the privileges that have been
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.680]   given to him to be next to God. John is a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus. He's a disciple of Jesus.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:32.540]   So Peter turns around, sees John, and he says, "Lord," verse 21, "what about Him?" I mean,
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:40.560]   this is remediation beyond comprehension. And then you have one, really one of the things
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.200]   that's one of the funniest statements, and Jesus didn't say a lot of funny things, but
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:53.540]   this is funny. He says, "If I want Him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:59.740]   If He lives to the second coming, it's none of your business. That's called hyperbole.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:06.180]   That's not only hyperbole, that's sarcasm. That is dripping sarcasm. I mean, and that's
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.440]   what you say when you finally become so exasperated with your kids that you resort to the idea
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.020]   of the second coming. You resort to dripping hyperbolic sarcasm.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:23.060]   It's irrelevant, Jesus says. It is irrelevant if I want Him to live till the second coming.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.420]   And so, of course, the rumor went out. You know what I heard? John is going to live till
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:40.320]   the second coming. We call that the grace vine.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:49.120]   The saying went out among the brethren, verse 23, that the disciple would not die. Yet Jesus
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.280]   didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, only that if I want Him to remain until I come,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:10.200]   what is that to you? Irrelevant. Well, they became buddies, didn't they, Peter and John?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.500]   They became buddies.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:23.700]   This is emphatic, the statement that our Lord gives in the original: "You follow Me." "You,"
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:37.160]   verse 22, "You follow Me." Forget about anybody else. Again, this is Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   face death, follow Me."
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:51.340]   John did die, thirty years after Peter, by the end of the first century, most likely
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:25:01.480]   on the island of Patmos, thirty years really after both Peter and Paul were martyred. So
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:09.960]   the gospel of John, the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ, rich, exalted,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   most theological, profound, presenting the Son of God as the I AM, demonstrating His
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.340]   glorious deity by words and works, leading to the massive, glorious conclusion of chapter
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.600]   20, verse 30 and 31, many other signs Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.960]   which are not written in this book, but these have been written, that you might believe
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.480]   that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life in
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.840]   His name. That glorious conclusion is where the gospel reaches its zenith.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:47.240]   We tumble from the end of chapter 20, from the pristine heights of glory, down to the
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:59.660]   difficulty of putting this glory in earthen vessels. That's us. And all the Lord asks
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:09.720]   is this: "Do you - " what? " - love Me?" I'll accept less than a perfect
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   love, but not less than a real love. That's not the elevation of the love; that's the
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.640]   nature of the love. It's a real love. It's an incorruptible love. "Do you love Me? Do
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:30.760]   you love Me? Do you love Me? Do you love Me? Go feed My lambs. Go feed My sheep. Deny
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:39.600]   yourself. Love Me. Are you willing to die if that's in the plan? Are you willing to
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.040]   give up your life for the Lord? Are you willing to give up your life for the Lord? Are you willing to
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.840]   give up your life for the Lord? Are you willing to give up your life for the Lord? Are you willing to
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:51.720]   live obediently, and that is in the plan, loving Me?"
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:59.620]   Many people today would say that you can love Christ and not love His Word. So the question
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:06.300]   is, is it possible to have a life that's transformed by Christ, yet not believe the Bible to be true?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.480]   No, it's not possible, because the only thing you know about Christ is what He's going to
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:17.400]   reveal in Scripture. You can't count on some mystical experience as if Christ out of nowhere
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:24.160]   appeared to you, or you had some transcendental moment where you thought you interacted with
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.420]   Christ. That's folly. The only way you can ever love Christ is to know Christ. The only
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.820]   way you can know Christ is in the revelation of the Word of God, which has revealed Him
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:39.360]   to us. And it's as we focus on the Word of God,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:49.840]   which is the truth written, that we see the Word of God, the truth incarnate, who is Christ.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.300]   Whether you are a new believer or just want to be encouraged by some basic truths of Scripture,
