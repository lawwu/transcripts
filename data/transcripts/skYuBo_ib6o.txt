[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   How do we get into a position where God is 100% for me and never again against me?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Is there a more important question for each of us to answer? I don't think there is.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   So how do we find a satisfying answer, especially in a world that tells us we are good enough or special enough to warrant God's eternal favor?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And in a world full of religions that say we can save ourselves?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Everyone has an answer to how God can become 100% for you.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   But how does God himself answer the question in his holy word?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Pastor John explained in a 2017 chapel message. Here he is.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   How do you get into this position? Who's he talking about?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   How do you get into the position where God is 100% for you and not against you?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   How do you get in there? I want in there!
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I want to be in that paradise!
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   How do you get into the position where God is 100% for you and not ever at all against you?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   The answer of the New Testament is by faith alone.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Now follow me.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   You need to be able to stand on this with all your might because of the accusations.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Follow me.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Romans 328.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think works of the law here and usually means any effort at law keeping.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Which does imply that Luther at least by way of interpretation got it right when he translated one is justified by faith alone apart from works of the law.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I think that is implied there.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But it doesn't say it. Let's look at another text.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Philippians 3.9.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Paul aims to be found "in Christ" that's crucial.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from law.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Law keeping.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But a righteousness which comes through faith in Christ.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   The righteousness from God that depends on faith.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So again he is denying and affirming.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   He denies that the righteousness he needs in the presence of God is his own.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That comes from law.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And he affirms that the righteousness he needs in the presence of God is in Christ.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In union with Christ.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Which comes through faith in Christ.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   The righteousness from God that depends on faith.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So again not law keeping but faith implies faith alone.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It gets clearer. Galatians chapter 2.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Chapter 2 verse 21.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I do not nullify the grace of God for if righteousness were through law Christ died to no purpose.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So the righteousness we need before God is not through law.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Not through law keeping.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Now maybe though it means not completely through law keeping.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Maybe this is room for a little bit.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Maybe it's really salvation by faith.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's just a little bit.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   A little bit of law keeping.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Like maybe just circumcision.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's not much.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   The most radical statement on this is Galatians 5 verses 1 to 3.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Look. I Paul say to you that if you accept circumcision.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Just one little effort at law keeping.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   If you accept circumcision.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   If you add that one little effort in addition to faith in Christ.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Christ is no advantage to you.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's wildly radical.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He is obligated to keep the whole law.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So if you choose to rely just a little bit on law keeping as a way of getting justified.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   As a way of getting into a position where God is 100% for you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Christ is of no advantage to you.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   If you go the route of justification by faith plus a little bit of law keeping.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You go the route of justification by total law keeping.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   All or nothing.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Verse 3 again.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   He is obligated to keep the whole law.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   There are two ways of justification.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   The way of law keeping which requires your perfection.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And the way of faith which depends on Christ's perfection.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   These two paths into the place where God is 100% for you are so distinct.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   They cannot be mixed at all.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   If you are trusting Christ for a righteous standing.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Where God is 100% for you.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You cannot mix one quiver of effort to establish your own righteousness.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And if you are seeking to establish your own righteousness.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Your own record of virtue.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   As an entrance into the position where God is 100% for you.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You cannot mix the slightest faith in Christ as your all sufficient righteousness.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They are mutually exclusive.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   That's solid.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We need that reminder often.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That was John Piper in a chapel message at Bethlehem College and Seminary on September 13th, 2017.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's titled, "Faith Alone. How Not to Use a Reformed Slogan."

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John in a recent sermon or an old message.

[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line as well if you would.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'm always interested to hear your favorite clips.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I'm Tony Reinke and Pastor John is back with us in studio on Friday.
