[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   All right, let's do one more question. What do we got?
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.720]   Okay. Questions from K-man. Do you have any recommendations for my 16-year-old son who is
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   now reading your books and listening to your podcast? He would like to create multiple
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.240]   streams of income and enjoy a deeply satisfying life. Let us know. We'll be listening.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.920]   Well, I mean, first of all, good for your son. Let that be the underlying piece of this answer,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.760]   is just to have someone at that age who is thinking so intentionally about their life
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.000]   is like a superpower. When you're 35 and thinking really intentional about your life,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.120]   it's like welcome to the club. Everyone at that point is starting to think through,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.480]   like, "Oh, what works for me? What doesn't? How should I organize my efforts? What do I want to
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.400]   do?" At 16, almost no one's doing that. Or if you're doing that, they're doing it in a very
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   simplistic formalism, like the millennial obsession with following your passion, some notion of,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.520]   "Well, there's one job I'm meant to do, and my job is to figure out what that is."
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.320]   Very few people your age are thinking so systematically. So that by itself is going
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.480]   to yield lots of benefits, irregardless of any particular advice I now give you going forward.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.160]   Now, let me provide you, I took some notes on this. I was looking at this question before.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.400]   So I want to try to provide some off, relatively rough advice for you as someone who was young,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.080]   to lay a foundation of support of sorts that will support a deep life as you enter adulthood.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   Now, the main thing I want to say to set up this foundation before we get to these specifics is,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   be wary about getting too specific right now at your age at 16 about what your sort of post-schooling
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.360]   adult life is going to be like in terms of specific sources of income, etc. It's very
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.480]   difficult as a 16-year-old, for example, to get 23, what your life's going to be like at 23,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.680]   to get those details right. Because you're not, you don't have knowledge yet of what you're going
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.120]   to be exposed to and what opportunities are going to be open to you. So this is really the right
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.400]   time to be much more laying a foundation for being able to take advantage of opportunities
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   and build this lifestyle when the time comes as you enter adulthood. So I would say, don't worry
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.880]   about the specifics yet. Let's work on you right now to make you into a deep life generation machine
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   so that you, four or five years from now, is going to be well-suited to start crafting a really cool
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.600]   life. So here's a few things I wrote down. Number one, be 10 times more organized and intentional
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   about your academic work than everyone else you know. Most students are terrible at study
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.720]   strategies. Most students are terrible at time management as a student. If you are not, you can
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.440]   reduce the amount of time it requires for you to perform your schoolwork at a certain level by a
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.560]   factor of three or four. It really is almost like a magic trick. I learned this from experience.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   You start treating your student life like a job, like a 35-year-old would treat their job,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.520]   and it becomes significantly easier. Its footprint on your life becomes significantly easier. The
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   amount of stress it causes will reduce down to very little, and you will be able to perform
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.560]   academically at the very height of your potential without grinding it out, without overloading or
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   overburdening yourself. So you know, I wrote a book about this, How to Become a Straight A Student.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.760]   That's for college kids. I wrote another book called How to Be a High School Superstar.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.240]   If you look at the part one playbook for that book, I adapt a lot of those study and time
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.360]   management advice from college to the high school context, so you might find value in both of those.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   So the Straight A Student book and the part one playbook from How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.840]   The story I always tell is, I was a reasonable student my first year of college.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.800]   At the end of the first year of college, I got serious about my academic strategies. I started
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.000]   treating the problem of how do you do well as a student like an entrepreneur would treat the
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   problem of how do I learn how to market, how do I find a new audience, because I'd run a business,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.960]   I was used to that way of thinking. I brought that way of thinking to my academic work, and I jumped
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:22.160]   from a good student, B+/A- student, to 4.0s starting my sophomore fall, every single quarter
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.240]   till I graduated, except for one A- in my senior spring. I ended up graduating with a 3.95 GPA.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.840]   If I had done this one quarter earlier, I probably would have been the valedictorian of my class at
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.280]   Dartmouth. I did not get smarter between the summer of my freshman year and my sophomore year.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.400]   What made me unique is I was one of the only people on that campus to start experimenting with
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.320]   what's the right way to take notes, what's the right way to study for a math test, what's the
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.480]   right way to study for an art history test, how can I manage my time so I don't have to ever work
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.040]   past 8 p.m. It was much easier than you would think. All right, so be 10 times more organized
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.240]   and tense about your academic work. Number two, introduce some discipline into your life.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.360]   So you get used to the idea of having a disciplined life. There's things that are
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.440]   important but hard, and you're willing to do that work over time and see the results in the long
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   term. You probably should have some sort of physical discipline, so some sort of sports or
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.520]   training, something that you do that will put you in better health or shape than just sort of the
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.960]   average person you know who's not a serious athlete. You should have some sort of mental
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.160]   discipline in there built around the reading of hard physical books. I'd probably recommend that
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   above all else for someone your age, that you have some sort of systematic program of study
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.320]   involving real books that you read, you have set times you put aside. Have two or three things like
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.360]   this just so you have a self-image of someone who is disciplined. And again, the details don't
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.720]   matter because you just need to, when the time comes, you know, when you're 24 or whatever,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.880]   the time comes for your discipline is going to unlock something awesome. You want to already
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:05.200]   have that tool sharpened. All right, number three, be very wary of video games or social media.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.160]   Your time is very valuable right now because you get leverage. Interesting moves or developments
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.960]   or opportunities you unlock when you're young have the maximum amount of time to actually earn
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.680]   experiential interest and start generating really cool things. So don't waste your teenage years,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   your early 20s, your college years. Don't waste 40% of your discretionary time in Call of Duty.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.840]   Don't waste 40% of your time on TikTok. Maybe that's okay for some people, but I can tell
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.200]   right now that this is a kid who is awesome, is at it, he's on it, he's listening to deep
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.640]   questions, he's reading my books, he's intentional, he's already thinking about multiple income
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   streams. So be very wary of those devices. Be the guy who's weird about like, "Yeah,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.040]   I just don't really use my phone." Let that be your thing. All right, number four,
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:01.280]   expose yourself to bulk positive randomness. That's a term that comes from my longtime friend,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   Ben Kastnoka, who wrote about that in his memoir of being a teenage entrepreneur prodigy. So like
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.840]   starting companies in his teenage years, "The Startup of You" is what that book is called.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   And he talks about this a lot. Expose yourself to lots of interesting stuff all the time to see what
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   clicks, what sticks, what ends up resonating and holding your attention the next day or the next
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.320]   week. Go hear speakers, read interesting things, go to interesting documentaries, go to conventions,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.480]   expose yourself to bulk positive randomness. This is how you get eventually something really
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.600]   interesting clicking in your life. And now to pull from my book, "How to Become a High School
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.160]   Superstar," once there is something that catches your attention that you're pursuing, you want to
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.520]   pursue what I call the failed simulation effect, which is you want to get to a place where that
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.960]   activity, if you're a young person, where people say, "I have no idea how he did that." And the
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.560]   way you generate that effect, which is incredibly powerful and opens up all these interesting
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.480]   opportunities, is you just keep leveraging up. You do one thing that's kind of explainable.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   You use that to get access to the next thing. You use that to get access to the third thing.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.720]   That third thing you use access to get to the fourth thing. And by the time you get to that
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.840]   fourth thing, that might be, "I'm interviewing Supreme Court justices for my podcast as a 17-year-old."
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.760]   That thing seems like, "I have no idea how a 17-year-old does that." But if you look to three
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:32.000]   steps before that started with you being exposed to a court reporter at an internship,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.440]   the path makes sense, but not when you see the final thing. Maybe that's a confusing explanation.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.360]   I have a whole chapter about this in my book. I also wrote about this, interestingly enough,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:50.240]   for Tim Ferriss's blog way back in the day when I first met Tim. So it's on there somewhere.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:58.400]   We're talking 2007, 2008 probably. I wrote an article for Tim.blog back when that was his main
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   online platform about the failed simulation effect. So you can actually find my article
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.720]   on his blog. You can probably just search for my name and Tim.blog or something like that.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.480]   But anyways, you expose yourself to interesting stuff. When something clicks, you keep going,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.800]   keep going, keep going. The first six months you're working on something that's interesting
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.360]   to you but not to the outside world, you get to a year plus six months, and you might be at a place
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.280]   now with that interest where people have no idea how you did that at your age, and that's when
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:34.560]   really cool opportunities open up. Number five, study character and leadership. Expose yourself
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.720]   to examples of people who live with great character, who act as great leaders, even during
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:48.320]   difficult times. Read biographies, read profiles, watch documentaries, maybe if they have a social
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.720]   media presence, so maybe like a Jocko Willink type if that resonates. Maybe you're listening to
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.840]   his podcast and the military professionals he has on that tell tales of valor. Whatever it is that
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:09.120]   resonates, you want to be imprinting young a real affiliation or affinity for character and leadership,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.080]   especially during difficult times. That is going to be a north star or a guiding light through all
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.040]   sorts of different ups and downs and competing pressures and diversions you're going to experience
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.280]   the next, let's say, 10 years of your life. Now's the time to start building up those examples.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   And number six, serve people. One way or the other, be doing that now. And it's just setting
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.160]   the habit of, and it could just be volunteering. It could be this is this cause or online. I go and
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.480]   I help. I'm in this community just to help these people, whatever it is. You also want that
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.720]   imprinted into your soul at a young age that serve other people, because that's what you need to fall
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.320]   back on when the other pursuit you have isn't going well. This company failed and I lost this
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.040]   job. And I really am feeling down on myself because I had these ambitions that I was going to be
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.720]   Michael Crichton at 27. And instead I'm at, you know, I'm getting to that age and I'm short on
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.560]   money and my plans didn't work. You fall back on helping others. Well, you know what? Let me just
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.800]   put that energy to helping others while I also am trying to figure myself out. The more you can fall
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.280]   back on how can I serve or help other people, the more emotional and psychological resilience you're
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.560]   going to have for all the ups and downs that are going to come. It's what's going to prevent you
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:28.160]   from ending up instead 26 and bitter and on Twitter and just mad and yelling at people and
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.920]   medicated seven ways to Sunday and just not even sure what to do with your life. You'll end up
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.800]   maybe like a, you know, an ideological groupie for some weird whatever and just be miserable.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.160]   You don't want to be there. So falling back on serving others as a default is that buffer,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.880]   is that protection be useful to the world, be useful to others. Let that also be a guiding
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.960]   light. All right. So those are my six pieces of advice, but good for you for thinking about this
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   stuff at such a young age. You do these things. You're going to be a rock star. You can be a rock
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.640]   star in college. You're going to come out of college and be living a life that you are going
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.080]   to have full control on the reins of this life. And when you start doing lifestyle center, career
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.120]   planning seriously, but you know, you really should wait till a little bit later in college
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.200]   to do so you are going to have options and whatever comes out of those initial lifestyle
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.560]   center, career planning exercises, you're going to be able to shape your life there,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:35.600]   live a deep life and a useful life. So I'm glad you asked that question. That's my advice.
