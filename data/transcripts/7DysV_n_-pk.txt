[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.940]   - Why are our lifespans so short today?
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.040]   If you've read the early chapters of Genesis,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.820]   our average lifespan of 80 years is woefully short
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.240]   compared to when folks lived to be 300, 400,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.560]   even 900 years old.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.760]   The question today is from a listener named Steven.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for this ministry.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.760]   Would you provide your thoughts on why people live
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   so long in the early chapters of Genesis?
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.520]   Thank you.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.400]   - The question why people lived so long
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.160]   in the early history of mankind,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560]   as described in Genesis 1 to 10,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.520]   is the flip side of why people for thousands of years
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.240]   have lived only 70 or 80 years
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   compared to hundreds of years.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   Of course, it's also the flip side of why people
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.120]   by the millions have died at five years old or 45 years old.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.120]   In other words, the issue of mortality in this world
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.120]   is a massive contrast, not only to eternal life,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.960]   but also to living 900 years.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.860]   So what's up?
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.120]   That's what the question is.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   In Genesis 5, Adam lives to be 930 years old.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.160]   His son, Seth, 912 years.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.400]   Seth's son, 910 years.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.200]   Methuselah, the oldest, 969 years.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400]   And Noah, 950 years.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   Then, after the flood, Noah's son Shem lives 600 years.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.800]   His son, 438 years.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.160]   Then, Shelah, 433 years.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   Then, Pila, 239 years.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   And then, Terah, the father of Abraham, 148 years.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.520]   And then, the age of the patriarchs, Abraham, 175 years.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.720]   Isaac, 180 years.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.760]   Jacob, 147 years.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   And then, after the 400-year bondage in Egypt,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   Moses, 120 years.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.640]   Joshua, 110 years.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.880]   And when we get to the period of the kings,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.240]   David died at 70, Solomon at 80,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.180]   which is where things have stood,
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.880]   I suppose you could say, for 3,000 years.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.160]   - Right.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   - 70 or 80 years, at best.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.360]   Now, as far as I can see,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.280]   the Bible does not state explicitly
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   why God would ordain that early mankind would live so long.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.680]   But I think if we ponder what the Bible says
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000]   about why our lives are so short,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720]   we will get a clue as to why
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.000]   the early generations lived so long.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.840]   We know from the story of creation in Genesis 1-3
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.720]   and in Romans 5, verses 12 following,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.520]   that death was not intended to be a part
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.800]   of the perfect world before sin
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   entered the world and with it, death.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.180]   Death was threatened by God as a penalty
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.280]   for disobedience, Genesis 2-17.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.880]   Therefore, the presence of death in the world
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   is not a natural part of the original perfect creation,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.100]   but a judicial part of the fallen creation.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.280]   It's a punishment.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.560]   The apostle Paul puts it like this, Romans 8-20.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.780]   The creation was subjected,
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.080]   so that's the fall under God's judgment.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   Creation was subjected to futility by God,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.340]   not willingly, but because of him who subjected it
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.020]   in hope that the creation itself
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.620]   would be set free from its bondage to corruption
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.260]   and obtain the freedom of the glory
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.680]   of the children of God.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.560]   So he describes the present situation
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.940]   of the created world as subjected to futility
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.320]   and in bondage to corruption.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.040]   And that word corruption regularly refers to mortality
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.480]   and how things move from a state of vitality
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   to dissolution and death.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.160]   So God subjected the world to corruption,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.060]   futility, death.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.960]   Death is a divine judicial sentence
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.640]   upon humanity because of sin.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.260]   The psalmist put it like this.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.080]   This is Psalm 90 verses four following.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.800]   A thousand years in your sight
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.700]   are but as yesterday when it is past.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.580]   Or as a watch in the night,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.720]   you sweep them away as with a flood.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.320]   They are like a dream, like grass
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.960]   that is renewed in the morning.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.720]   For all our days pass away under your wrath.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.660]   That's the judicial part of death.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.000]   We bring our years to an end like a sigh.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.800]   The years of our life are 70 or even by reason of strength, 80
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.280]   yet their span is but toil and trouble.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.480]   They are soon gone and we fly away.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   Now, if we ask what the aim of this divine judgment is,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.440]   the answer is at least partly to make us aware
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   that sin is horrible.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   Sin is a great outrage against God
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.100]   and life is short and eternity is long.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.960]   And we need wisdom to know how to think
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   and live with so little time on earth compared to eternity.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.860]   So the Psalmist prays in Psalm 39 verse four,
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.060]   "Oh Lord, make me know my end
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.520]   and what is the measure of my days.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.080]   Let me know how fleeting I am.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.440]   Behold, you have made my days a few hand breaths
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.360]   and my lifetime is as nothing before you.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.480]   Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.880]   Surely a man goes about as a shadow."
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.820]   And James in the New Testament makes the same point
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.000]   when he says, James 1, 9,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.500]   "Let the rich boast in his humiliation
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   because like a flower of the grass, he will pass away."
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.280]   Peter makes the same point.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   Chapter one, verse 24, "All flesh is like grass
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.900]   and all its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.180]   The grass withers and the flower falls,
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.660]   but the word of the Lord remains forever."
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.740]   In other words, human mortality
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.420]   and the shortness of life cries out to the world.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.100]   Your life is a vapor.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.620]   Your life is a vapor.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.620]   Take hold of what lasts.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.620]   Take hold of God.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.680]   Take hold of Christ.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.780]   Take hold of the gospel.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.020]   God's point to the world in the brevity of life
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   is that a trumpet blast be sounded from every funeral
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.700]   millions upon millions of funerals.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.620]   Look away.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.100]   Look away from this mortal life.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.040]   Look away from this fallen world of sin
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.300]   and corruption and futility.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.100]   Look for your portion and your hope
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.640]   and your treasure outside this world.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.620]   Look to God, look to Christ, look to the gospel.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.600]   That's the point of mortality.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.460]   So what can we say about the extraordinarily long lives then
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.780]   of those first humans in Genesis 1 to 10?
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.340]   Why did they live 900 years?
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.340]   Perhaps there's a clue in listening to the patriarch Jacob
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.700]   before he died.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.080]   He said in Genesis 47, 9,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.400]   "The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.700]   Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life,
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.980]   and they have not attained to the days of the years
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.420]   of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning."
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.420]   So Jacob feels the contrast between his length of life,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.600]   which we would consider long,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.460]   and the length of those who have gone before.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.480]   And surely we feel it.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.720]   We should feel it.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.560]   When we look at our three score in 10,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.900]   or by reason of strength, four score,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.020]   or 87 or 88, like my dad,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.620]   surely we are to feel that some of our ancestors
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.380]   live 10 times that long,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.180]   and we are to wonder at it.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.200]   So my suggestion is that God granted those long lives
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.780]   so that we, looking back,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.700]   could see from which we have fallen.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.260]   In other words, those long lives testify
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.020]   that death was not part of the perfect creation.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.340]   God ordains as a lesson to us
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.340]   that the force of life be preserved for hundreds of years
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.620]   in very long lives in those early centuries
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.580]   to show that life, not death, was his design
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   and our portion in creation at the beginning.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.780]   So the long lives of those first humans
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.780]   stands as a testimony of how utterly short our lives are
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.620]   and how God's design at the beginning
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.060]   and his design in the future is life,
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   life, indeed, eternal life.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.740]   Paul says in 2 Timothy 1:10,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.580]   "Grace has now been manifested
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.580]   through the appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.620]   who abolished death and brought life and immortality
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.980]   to light through the gospel."
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.520]   In other words, the gospel of Christ reverses
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.080]   the curse of mortality
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.540]   and opens the door of eternal life
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.160]   for all who believe.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.140]   Those long lives were just pointers.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.660]   It's about life, it's about life,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.380]   and then it's taken from us in its fullness
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.380]   and restored in the gospel through Jesus.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.720]   - Amen, very long life was God's original design,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.340]   something that we can now look forward to
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.740]   in our glorification in Christ.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
