[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Well, the gospel of Jesus Christ is of first importance, Paul tells us.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.640]   So few things are more important than rehearsing the glories
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.120]   of Calvary over and over again.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.440]   And that leads us to today's question from a regular listener
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.160]   to the podcast named Frank.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.820]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for investing so much time and thought
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000]   into this podcast over the years.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   I'm a regular listener, and my question for you is about Jesus who, quote,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.400]   "gave himself as a ransom for all," 1 Timothy 2.6.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   But who did Jesus pay the ransom to?
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.880]   Is he making the payment to Satan to free us from Satan's captivity, or is
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680]   he giving his payment to God to free us from our penalty?
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.400]   So does the New Testament tell us anywhere who Jesus's ransom paid?
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   The New Testament, it seems to me, never says in just so many words that the
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.680]   ransom Jesus paid was paid to God.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.560]   But there is a hint in the Old Testament, and I think the pictures of the death of
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.280]   Christ in the New Testament as a sacrifice made to God for the obtaining of a
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.480]   redemption, if not explicit, are implicit in that the payment was made by God to God.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   But it's important here to remember that all these descriptions in the New
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.600]   Testament—redemption, justification, propitiation, reconciliation, and so on—all
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.720]   of these things are analogies taken over from human experience, some of them
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.480]   metaphors, and like all analogies, some aspects apply, some don't, and we have
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.720]   to ask in every case which ones do and which ones don't.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.880]   So, for example, it would be a terrible mistake, I think, to say that the use of
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   the word "ransom," which Jesus did use about his own death, means that there's
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   going to be an exchange of money between anybody and God.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   In fact, Peter went out of his way in chapter 1 to say that we are not ransomed
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.120]   by silver and gold.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.800]   So the best way to think about the image of ransoming, I think, is to let the
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.440]   actual biblical descriptions of the death of Christ flesh out for us what the
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.000]   analogy of a ransom means.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.640]   So just a word about Satan, though.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.080]   No way, no way is the death of Christ a negotiation with Satan or a payment to
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   Satan.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.440]   When Christ meets the demonic forces in his ministry, they don't say, "Did you
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280]   bring the money?"
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.760]   He commands, and they go.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520]   No negotiation.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   And when Paul describes what happened to Satan on the cross in Colossians 2:15, he
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.760]   disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to an open shame, triumphing over
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   them in him.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.680]   So this is total defeat, not negotiation.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.520]   So in my mind, there's no thought in the Bible about God paying the devil a
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.040]   ransom.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.200]   So here's the clue I mentioned from the Old Testament about God being the
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840]   recipient of a ransom.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   In Psalm 49.7, we read, "Truly no man can ransom another or give to God the price
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.160]   of his life, for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice."
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.280]   And then verse 15, "But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.360]   will receive me."
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.320]   Now, I don't think this is a direct reference to the ransom of Christ, but
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.480]   rather a picture of how difficult it is to get people out of Sheol, who is laying
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.680]   claim on all these human beings like a kidnapper.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.240]   But it certainly is suggestive that if a ransom is to be involved in rescuing
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.120]   humans from death, it's not going to be unbiblical to talk about paying it to
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.640]   God.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:38.000]   So when Jesus comes into the world, he says in Mark 10.45, "For even the Son of
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.560]   Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.440]   many." And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6.20, "You were bought with a price, so
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.600]   glorify God in your body."
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:04.360]   So here's why I think the ransom was paid by God to God, and in what sense it
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.120]   was a ransom.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   And the key text, absolutely crucial, I think, is Romans 3.24 and 25.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.680]   Here's what it says.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.120]   "They are justified by his grace as a gift." That's what it means to be treated
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.480]   graciously, as a gift.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:35.080]   "Through the redemption, the ransoming that is in Christ, whom God put forward as
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   a propitiation by his blood." In other words, a sacrificial offering made on the
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.160]   mercy seat to God to avert his wrath and restore man, what a ransom does, restore
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.240]   us to the rightful belonger, parent or God or whoever we've been kidnapped from,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.040]   so to speak, to be received by faith.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.400]   So the picture is this.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.800]   Man has fallen short, far short of the glory of God, has offended the glory of
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.840]   God, has besmirched and dishonored the glory of God, chapter 3, verse 23, and
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.040]   chapter 1, verse 23, "We have committed treason by exchanging the glory of God
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.080]   for images.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   God in his holiness and wrath upholds the glory of his name by sentencing us in
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.520]   condemnation to eternal suffering in hell.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:40.560]   But he's also a God of great mercy, and he prepared another way for his glory to
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.160]   be upheld in justice, namely," that's what Romans 3, 25 is about, "namely by
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.920]   sacrificing his son for those who believe instead of sending them to hell." And that
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:02.760]   sacrifice, Paul says, ransomed, redeemed people from the wrath of God.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   Glorious gospel, from the wrath of God.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.720]   Romans 5, 9, "Since we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.320]   be saved by him from the wrath of God."
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.600]   That's the big issue.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.080]   That's the big problem in the universe, God's wrath.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   And by the shedding of blood, we have escaped the wrath of God.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   The blood ransoms.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.120]   It redeems from the wrath of God.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.400]   So if I answer, "How did it do that?
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.120]   How did the payment actually work?"
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:49.000]   I would say that what was paid was the repair of God's dishonor.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.520]   The repair of God's dishonored glory, because the death of Jesus, in giving up
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.600]   so much glory, out of love and honor to the Father, has repaired all that has
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.040]   been dishonored by the sins of God's people.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.240]   That's what's been paid.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:18.440]   So in that sense, I think the ransom was paid by God, in Christ, to God, in
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   sending his Son to die, to rescue us from God's wrath, because of the massive
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.440]   debt of glory that we owed to the Father and could never, ever pay.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.760]   And the payment was not silver and gold, but the blood of Christ, exalting
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.400]   and restoring the glory of God.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.880]   Incredible.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.320]   Amen and amen.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.480]   Oh man, I don't think the gospel will make sense until we see the payment
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.000]   being exacted from God and paid to God.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.800]   That's absolutely critical insight.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.200]   Well, we are going to close the week talking about how far Christians can go
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.160]   in supporting extrajudicial killings by its own government.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.280]   Uh, this is a huge topic in America with police shootings, but this is also a very
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.680]   huge issue right now, uh, for Christians in the Philippines.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.200]   And, uh, John Piper and I will return on Friday to see how the Bible bears
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.040]   on this very controversial subject.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.080]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
