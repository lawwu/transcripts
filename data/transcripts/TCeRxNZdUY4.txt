[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Unfortunately the master tape from which the following recording was taken is in very poor
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.720]   condition. However we have digitally restored it and we do apologise for the poor quality of parts
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.240]   of it. However we hope it will not spoil your enjoyment of this sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:32.960]   to be found in the first part of the first verse in the 14th Psalm, "The fool hath said in his heart
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   there is no God." "The fool hath said in his heart there is no God."
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   That I say is the first statement in the first verse in the 14th Psalm.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.160]   Now there can be no question at all that the greatest matter confronting every one of us who
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.040]   is in this world this evening is this whole question which is put before us by this statement
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.440]   in this psalm. Nothing, surely we all must agree whatever our view is, nothing can be
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:27.120]   more important than this matter of our relationship to God. I say that it is greater than any other
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.360]   question. There are many great questions confronting us and confronting the world
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.640]   at this present hour. You are as aware of that as I am myself and it is right that we should be
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.040]   gravely concerned about them. It may well be that the whole position of the world and of
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:00.960]   civilization tonight has again reached one of those climactic moments. It's no part of my
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.840]   business or that of anybody else to be an alarmist, but any reading or any understanding
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.560]   of the things that are happening in the world tonight must surely bring us all to see
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   that there are momentous matters which are not only occupying the minds of statesmen but also
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.960]   of the common people. The world is in a terrible position. It's very right therefore that you
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.720]   should think, and we should all think as Christian people and everybody, of the possibility of yet
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.600]   another war. That's a very great and important question, this whole matter of these bombs
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:53.280]   and their possible use, and indeed the latest discoveries and triumphs of science.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.280]   It's very right that we should be considering and talking about this satellite, so-called,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.880]   that has suddenly been released, this extraordinary phenomenon.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.320]   Now, I say that whatever our views and whatever our attitude tonight, we should recognize,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   if we think at all and are concerned seriously about our existence in this world,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.480]   that all this denotes tremendous possibilities. It is indeed a tremendous matter that man has
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.200]   been able to do what he has succeeded in doing. And yet I say that this question that is put
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.440]   before us here by the psalmist transcends all those other questions in importance.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.120]   And that is why this evening I'm not going to preach to you about the satellite,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   and neither am I going to preach to you about hydrogen bombs, nor about the Labour Party
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.840]   Conference, nor the forthcoming Conservative Party Conference, nor any one of these matters.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.920]   Because, as I understand my calling, my privilege is to address you on something
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   which is infinitely more important than all those things even put all together.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.440]   Why? Well, for this good reason, that here we are dealing with something
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   which is absolutely certain, and which goes on and continues whatever may happen with respect
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   to any one of the other questions. Whether there is a war or not, my relationship to God still
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.880]   remains. Even though there be no war, I know that my life in this world is limited, and that I still
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   have to face this question. And indeed, should there be a war, and should these horrible things
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   be used, and should we find hell let loose again upon the face of the earth, well, then I think
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.960]   it needs very little demonstration that there will be nothing more important at that moment
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.320]   than our relationship to God. If London is reduced to a mass of rubble, well, then my interest will
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.160]   not be in London, not in its buildings, not in its universities, not in anything, but I shall be
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.960]   face to face with my own destiny. And that brings me at once to this question of my relationship
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   to God. So I say that this is incomparably the greatest and the most important question
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.480]   that can ever face men and women while they are in this world.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.680]   Now there are many attitudes towards this question of our relationship to God.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.560]   But I this evening want to consider with you only this particular one which is here described
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.840]   by the psalmist, and that is the attitude which says, "There is no God." Now this, as you know,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.720]   is a very common attitude. There are many who take up this position and who say that,
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.240]   to plan their lives and order their existence on this idea and on this supposition. They say,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.760]   "I don't believe in God." And they go on to say, "If you don't believe in God,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.280]   what difference does it make?" You are familiar with that attitude. The people who say,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.560]   "There is no God, and it makes no difference to my life at all, the fact that there is no God."
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.920]   Now then, let's consider what this man is going to say about that. And you notice that he makes
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.520]   a very blunt assertion. And what the psalmist says about any man who is in that position
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:51.200]   is simply that he's a fool. The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.760]   Now, the thing I want to emphasize is this, that the psalmist is making a universal statement.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.800]   He doesn't say, "Some of the people who say that there is no God are fools." He says,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   "Every one of them is." He doesn't say, "Of course there are fools who say this sort of thing,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.480]   but on the other hand there are great and learned and educated people who also say that." Not at
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.080]   all. He makes a universal statement without any qualification, without any limitations,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.600]   without any exceptions whatsoever. The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.880]   Or putting it the other way around, any man who says that there is no God, well, he's just a fool.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.480]   What's a fool? Well, the real meaning of the word "fool" is that he's a superficial person.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:46.240]   The fool is the man who doesn't think. The fool is contrasted always with the wise man.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.720]   Or as the psalmist contrasts him with the man of understanding, he said, "The Lord looked down
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.680]   from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand."
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.480]   So the fool, you see, is a man who lacks understanding. He lacks the ability to think
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.920]   clearly. He's a man who acts in an impetuous manner, who doesn't consider the consequences.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.520]   That is the biblical meaning of the word "fool." He's a man who's acting in an idiotic manner.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.240]   He's lacking in reason and understanding and insight.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:28.160]   "Dear me," says someone, "surely this is a most extraordinary statement. Is that true today?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.120]   Is that your contention? Are you asserting that what the psalmist said in his day and generation
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:42.400]   is still the simple truth today?" Well, I am concerned to establish this very proposition
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:50.720]   this evening. I am in this pulpit because I believe in the depths of my being that any man
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:58.240]   who says that there is no God is just a fool. And the business of preaching is to enlighten him,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.240]   is to show him his error, is to expose him to the utter folly of the position that he has taken up.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.800]   I do so in love. I do so because of my concern for any such person who may be listening to me
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:20.160]   at this moment. There is nothing to me so tragic as that a man should be a fool and that in his
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:29.600]   folly he should say, "There is no God." Very well then, how do I establish it? How could the
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   psalmist have established it in his day? Well, I want to reason the thing out with you.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:46.160]   I say the times are so serious and so desperate that I need not remind you that I'm doing this
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:53.920]   not because I delight in argumentation or disputation or because I like conducting this
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.720]   kind of inquiry in an intellectual and in a theoretical manner. I hope to show you before
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   I finish that, as I've already been saying, this is the vital matter of all matters,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   the things that depend upon it are so momentous and so terrifying that I feel it is my duty to
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   put this matter as simply and as plainly and as directly as I can to anybody who is prepared to
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:30.400]   listen. Very well then, here is the contention that any man who says in his heart that there is no God
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.480]   is a fool. Well, in what respects is he a fool? Well, here's the first.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.800]   The first respect in which he's a fool is that he's a man who listens over much to his heart.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God."
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:57.360]   Here is a man, according to the psalmist, who is governed by his desire,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   whose outlook is determined by this which he calls the heart, which is the seat of the
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.240]   sensibilities. He's a man who's governed by what he likes and what he wants to do and what he
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.840]   pleases and what he desires, rather than by certain other things. It's a decision he's
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.920]   arrived at, says the psalmist, in his heart. Well now, why is this a foolish thing to do?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.960]   Well, let me put it in the form of a number of contrasts.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:36.720]   Here is a man, I say, who is a fool because he listens to his heart and his desire.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.480]   Instead of listening to that sense which is within him, as it is within the whole of the human race,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:57.920]   the sense of God. Now, there is in every man and woman born into this world a sense of God.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.280]   It is universal. There has never been a person in this world but that he's had a sense of God.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.360]   Now, a man, of course, may try to stifle that. He may try to argue it down. He may try to browbeat
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:19.120]   it. But what I'm asserting is that in every human being there is a sense of God. And, of course,
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.000]   this is rarely granted because there are many today who don't believe in God, who think that
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   they can explain away the sense of God, which they've got to admit. But the fact is, therefore,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.640]   that there is in all of us, in this manner, this amazing sense of God.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.560]   The feeling that at the back of everything there is this eternal being.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:51.520]   That at the back of everything that is seen is the great, unseen, eternal God. There is this
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.800]   natural sense of reverence in us all, perhaps accompanied by an element of fear. But it's
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   there. You can go, as has been done, you can go and study anthropology. And you can go and
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.880]   investigate the condition of the most primitive tribes that are in the world at this moment.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.200]   You'll find them in the heart of Central Africa. You'll find them in the heart of Australia and
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.160]   in Northwest America. And you will find that in the most primitive tribes known to mankind,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:34.400]   there is nevertheless this sense of God, this sense of a supreme being, this sense of a God
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.000]   who's at the back of and beyond all the other gods that they worship. Many of them worship
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.400]   stones and trees and find spirits in animals and so on. But they've all got this sense of God.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.920]   It is a universal sense. Now, I say that a man who brushes that aside,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.880]   and who listens and who's governed by what he wants to be the truth and what he'd like to be
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:05.680]   the truth in order that he may live a certain kind of life, is just being a fool. Surely it is our
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.360]   business to pay very close and careful attention to anything that is elemental within us, anything
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:17.920]   that is profound within us. A man who dismisses something that seems to be an innate part of his
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:25.360]   personality and of his very being is, I suggest, a fool. Now, any man who says there is no God is
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   guilty of doing that, he is going against a vice within himself that says there is a God.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.920]   Very well, that's only the first point.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.480]   In the same way, such a man goes against the vice of his conscience.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.880]   For again, this is something that is beyond dispute. We all have a conscience within us.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:55.440]   We often wish we hadn't, but we've got it. And when we do something that is wrong,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.520]   our conscience tells us so, and it condemns us. It makes us feel miserable. We may pass
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.040]   through an agony of remorse, if not of repentance. That's the vice of conscience speaking.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.560]   The vice that says you shouldn't have done it, that's wrong. That isn't true. That's against
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.480]   this God, the sense of whom you have within you. There it is in the whole of mankind,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.720]   a conscience which we can't explain. And yet you see, here is a man who says the sun is too
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.960]   violent, that in the same way he doesn't listen to it, he doesn't pay attention to it, he isn't
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.520]   governed by it. What's he governed by? Ah, he's governed by another type of life that he's
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.080]   conjured up. He sees other people living it. He says to himself, "Now, it would be a wonderful
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.400]   thing if I could go and live that sort of life." Ah, but he's a bit afraid of that because he
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.640]   thinks it isn't godly and his conscience condemns him, but he says, "Very well then, there is no
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.280]   God. Why, perhaps after all I've been fooling myself." So in order to live that life, he has
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.800]   to say, "There is no God." He can't do the two things at the same time, so he says, "There is
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.080]   no God." But this is the thing that makes him say it. He's violating the vice of his conscience,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.040]   as he has already violated this sense of God that is within him.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   But, and this is the one I really want to emphasize, this man is a fool
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.440]   because he doesn't use and doesn't listen to his understanding.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.880]   Now that is, as I said, the psalmist's contention. "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:33.440]   children of men to see if there were any that did understand. 'Have all the workers of iniquity no
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:41.280]   knowledge?' he asks. 'Who eat up my people as they eat bread?'" Here is the final charge against this
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.640]   man, and it is of course at this point we see most clearly and plainly the fact that the man is a
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:54.720]   fool. He is not listening to his understanding. Now then, I want to take up this point and to
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   look at it for a moment in general because I think you'll all agree that there are two
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.200]   main objections which are brought very volubly and in a very clement manner at the present time
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.960]   against the very thing that I'm saying. The average man today, surely, if he hears a man
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.080]   saying what I've just been saying, that a man who says there is no God is a fool because he doesn't
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.920]   listen to his understanding, I say the average man of today wants to get up and say, "My dear sir,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.480]   do you know that you're preaching in 1957 and not in AD 57 or something like that?" They say,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   "To say that people today have no understanding because they don't believe in God, why?"
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:44.080]   He argues it's because of their understanding they don't believe in God. Now that is the argument,
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:52.800]   isn't it? The argument today is that these people don't believe in God because of their knowledge,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   because of their understanding, because of their great brains, because of their wonderful ability.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.960]   And they say the only people who still believe in God are these primitive types who haven't
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.840]   yet developed, or these psychological cases, these psychopaths, or these people who deliberately put
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.160]   their heads in the sands and won't look at the evidence and won't face the facts. Isn't that
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   the argument? Well, now let me meet it. The psalmist's contention is that these people are
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:25.200]   fools, and they're fools because they don't act on their understanding but on their desires.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.960]   How do I establish it? Well, I establish it like this.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:39.840]   Is this disbelief in God confined to the learned and to the people of knowledge?
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.400]   You see, if this argument is right, it would be the case that all the ignorant people in the world
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.440]   would be believers in God. But the learned people, the people of knowledge, and especially scientific
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.960]   knowledge, every one of them would not believe in God. But is that the case? Well, we know perfectly
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   well that for every learned, intelligent man you can show me in the world tonight who doesn't
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:15.600]   believe in God, I can show you a man who is unlearned and ignorant and lacking in intelligence
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.400]   and lacking in ability. Oh, I know it's a wonderful thing to hear people on the brains trust,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.640]   the picked intellects, they don't believe in God. But you know, I can find you five or six
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.080]   people on the street corner, whenever you like, who'll say exactly the same thing as them.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.640]   Is this denial of God based upon learning? Why does the ignorant, unlettered,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.680]   unintelligent person say exactly the same thing?
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.160]   And you know, this is rather interesting, it's rather important.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.400]   Did you know that at the present time
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.640]   religion, belief in God, and the worship of God
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.800]   is more popular amongst the intelligent people in this country than it is amongst the others?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.200]   Now, this is a charge that is very often hurled at the church because of the statistics. What
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.120]   is being said at the present time is this, "Ah," they say, "the Christian church, yes,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.760]   it's just middle class. It's mainly middle class. It doesn't touch the masses of the people.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.120]   It's just middle class." Well, now, that's a very important statement, isn't it?
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.280]   I'm not here to say anything against any particular group in society, but I am here to indicate this.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:39.200]   That religion is most successful today in the universities amongst the more intelligent people,
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.600]   the people who are in such places of learning because they've got brains and intelligence.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.920]   It's succeeding there much more than it is succeeding in suburbia,
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.480]   much more than it is succeeding amongst the masses of the people.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.920]   The fact is that the masses of the people are unconcerned today,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.960]   and the Christian church, somehow or another, is not touching them.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.880]   Well, all I say, therefore, is this, it is not primarily a matter of intelligence.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.840]   The facts prove that it isn't.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:12.160]   But come, let me put that in a still stronger form to you.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:19.280]   Not only can I thus establish that the unintelligent and illiterate and
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.840]   people who have no culture don't believe in God, I can, on the other side, show you how men of
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:34.080]   knowledge and men of learning and men of culture and men of science have been some of the greatest
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.440]   believers in God and in Christ that the church and the world has ever known.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.080]   I couldn't help thinking of it during these past days.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.520]   Take all this talk about this satellite, take all this question of light and so on.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.760]   Why, the men who made perhaps the greatest contribution of all in that realm
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.160]   was a man called Isaac Newton.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:02.080]   And you know, people only know about Isaac Newton in terms of his scientific discoveries
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.840]   and theorizings and his brilliant hypotheses.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.040]   They know about him and the apple falling and so on.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.960]   They don't know this, that Isaac Newton spent most of his time in studying the scriptures
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.920]   and in writing books about prophecy and himself regarded his religious
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.040]   work and his writings on scripture and prophecy as being altogether more important than the other.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   Here, I say, is one of the great towering geniuses of all times in the scientific realm
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.520]   in the same century where a man like Pascal living,
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.800]   the brilliant mathematician, and these men believe in God.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.560]   I don't want to keep you.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:47.520]   But you see, this argument that the modern disbelief in God is the result of knowledge
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.240]   and learning and understanding, it just doesn't hold water for a second
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.160]   the moment you begin to analyze it.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.440]   I say the facts I've put before you demonstrate quite clearly that whatever is the explanation,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.400]   it isn't the explanation of knowledge and of learning.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.280]   It's the lack of it.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.400]   It is because these men are fools and are governed by something else
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.160]   rather than by their understandings.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.440]   But come, let me say a word about the second objection, which is this.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:22.000]   I can imagine someone saying, "Well, now, of course, all that you've just been saying
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.960]   might have been quite all right a hundred years ago or perhaps two hundred years ago.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.080]   But, you know," they say, "that isn't really the position now.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.840]   The majority today are not interested in God and in Christ and in the church and in salvation
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.960]   because of our recent knowledge.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   It's the recent knowledge that's done it.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.840]   Darwin, you see, writing his book in 1859 on the spread of biological knowledge,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.040]   all these other things, this is what's done it.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.800]   And our knowledge of psychology, study of comparative religion and so on,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.320]   it's all this latest knowledge.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.640]   And any man who really is aware of all this latest knowledge,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.200]   he's driven to saying that there is no God.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.440]   So it is the latest knowledge that makes men say that there is no God.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.560]   But, you see, the simple answer to that is this,
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.720]   that in the time that David wrote this psalm, people were saying exactly the same thing.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.400]   They said it then.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.520]   You see, there's nothing new about not believing in God.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.120]   It's the oldest thing in the world is to deny God.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.600]   And this is the thing to me that's so pathetic,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.040]   that people think it's clever not to believe in God, that it's modern,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.680]   that it's something new, that it's something wonderful.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.160]   Look here, here's a man, King David, writing all this long time ago,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.480]   a thousand years before Christ, nearly 3,000 years ago,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   and there were people saying then there is no God.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.880]   What the clever people are saying today,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   and who try to argue that they're saying it in terms of some latest knowledge,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.440]   this esoteric knowledge that they've been let into, and which people still don't have.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.760]   My dear friend, isn't it clear that this has nothing at all to do with knowledge as such?
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.400]   It isn't a question of knowledge, it's a question of understanding.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.880]   And that's a very different thing.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.920]   A man may be a very able man.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.600]   A man may have a lot of book knowledge.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.680]   It doesn't mean that he has understanding.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.360]   It doesn't mean that he has wisdom.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.560]   A man can be aware of numbers of facts,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.360]   but he may be a fool in his own personal life.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.640]   Haven't we known such men?
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.000]   I've known men in some of the learned professions.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.040]   I'd take their opinion without a moment's hesitation,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.560]   because of their knowledge, because of their learning,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.240]   because of their understanding.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.480]   But you know, sometimes I've known some of those men
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.120]   to be utter fools in their own personal lives.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.560]   I mean by that, that they behaved like lunatics,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.000]   as if they hadn't a brain at all.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   They behaved in exactly the same way as a man
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.160]   who'd never had their educational advantages,
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   and who had none of their great knowledge.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   They drank too much, even as he did.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   They were guilty of adultery, even as he is.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.640]   There's all the difference in the world
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.760]   between awareness of facts and of knowledge,
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.800]   and wisdom and real understanding.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.040]   Because though a man may have a great brain
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.400]   and may know a number of things,
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.600]   he may still be governed by his lusts and passions
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.760]   and desires, that's why he's a fool.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.720]   He wants to live this kind of life
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.640]   that the psalmist describes here.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.160]   There is none that doeth good.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   They've all become filthy, he says,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.000]   and it's because they want to be filthy
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.520]   that they say there is no God.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.800]   So that there is my first reason
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.560]   for calling such a man a fool.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.120]   He is a man who listens to his heart,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.520]   his desires, what he wants to do,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.840]   rather than by true understanding.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.680]   But come, let me come to a second point.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:08.000]   He is, I say, a fool,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.880]   because, as I've just been putting it,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.720]   he lacks this true understanding.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.800]   I've been saying that he listens to his heart
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.520]   rather than to his understanding.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.480]   Now I want to show you in a much more positive way
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:32.560]   how he really fails to exercise a true understanding.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.720]   And this is something I can demonstrate to you in two ways.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:45.280]   The first is that he arrives at momentous conclusions
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.320]   on insufficient evidence.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.280]   Now I think you'll agree with me,
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   whatever your view of this matter is,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.160]   that any man who arrives at a conclusion
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   with insufficient evidence
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.400]   is behaving like a fool.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.120]   A fool is a man who doesn't reason a thing
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.800]   through, he jumps to conclusions.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720]   He is governed by his prejudices,
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.120]   or as I say, by his passions and lusts,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.240]   and by his desires.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   It is the mark of a fool always
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.840]   to draw momentous conclusions or deductions
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.760]   from inadequate or insufficient evidence.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.440]   And I say that any man who says there is no God
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.760]   is guilty of that.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.440]   Now then, let me try and prove what I'm saying.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.600]   What are these arguments that they bring forward?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.800]   Well, I can't mention all of them,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.840]   but I can mention some of them.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.200]   Here's a very common one.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.440]   There are thousands of people in the world tonight
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.760]   who say, "I don't believe in God.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.280]   I don't believe there is a God."
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.120]   And you say, "Well, now why don't you believe them?"
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   And they say, "Well, it's quite simple.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   If there is a God, why are there wars?
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.720]   Or if there is a God, why are there spastic children?
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.080]   If there is a God, why are there earthquakes
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.400]   and pestilences and things like that?"
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.080]   And on that, and on that alone,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.200]   they have come to the conclusion that there is no God.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.400]   Now, it's amazing how intelligent people
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.160]   can reason and argue like that.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.560]   I had a conversation a few months ago
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.520]   with a highly intelligent professional man
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.520]   who came to me and asked
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.440]   if he might talk to me about these things.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.080]   And he said he didn't believe in God.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.760]   And I said, "Well, what is your reason
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.120]   for not believing in God?"
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.040]   And the only reason that he could produce was this,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.880]   that his wife had, for a while,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.800]   to endure a very painful illness.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.440]   And that, to him, was a proof that there is no God.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.160]   Well, of course, the argument, you see,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.440]   was a very simple one.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.880]   Well, I first had to show him that he arrived
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.120]   at that tremendous conclusion
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.960]   on that one bit of evidence alone.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.320]   Had he ever thought that perhaps
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.640]   it was a part of the purpose of God to allow this
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.480]   in order to bring something else to pass?
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.840]   I said, "How have you and your wife
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   normally lived with respect to God?
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   Have you been regular worshipers of God?
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   Have you lived to the praise and the glory of God
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.040]   in the whole of your lives?"
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.360]   He had to admit as an honest man that they hadn't.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.880]   They'd been living for themselves.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.280]   They rarely thought of God at all.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.360]   They certainly never attended a place of worship.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.760]   They'd been living an entirely godless life.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   And yet, you see, because his wife has pain,
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.480]   there is no God.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.360]   Now then, I said, "It doesn't occur to you, obviously,
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.040]   that perhaps God permitted your wife to have this pain
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.800]   in order to make you and your wife
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.200]   think a little bit seriously about God
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.600]   and come, perhaps, to have this conversation with me.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.920]   God has blessed you.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.800]   You haven't thanked him.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.320]   You've ignored him altogether.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.920]   Perhaps God has chastised you now
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   in order to bring you to your senses."
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.760]   I said, "I've known many people, you know,
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.440]   who, looking back across their lives,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.360]   have said, with the psalmist, who said,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.080]   'It was good for me that I have been afflicted
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.200]   because before my affliction, I went astray.'"
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.080]   I said, "You know nothing.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.800]   You haven't thought.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.320]   No, you haven't thought about that."
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.920]   I said, "My dear sir,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.080]   if you and I don't understand ourselves
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.160]   and other people and the workings of their minds,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.320]   how do you think you can so easily understand God
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.920]   and say, 'Now, because he doesn't do this,
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.440]   therefore, isn't a God?'"
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.600]   I said, "See the conclusion you're drawing
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.120]   on such flimsy evidence."
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.400]   He'd never thought about it at all.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.960]   I can't stop with this argument this evening.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.600]   But there are thousands of people
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.720]   who don't believe in God
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.560]   because of the problem of pain.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.640]   And yet, you know, the answer to the problem of pain
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   is a very simple one.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.400]   The Bible has got it in many places,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.000]   and there are books that expound it.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.440]   It's so easy to explain,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.400]   yet these people, you see,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.920]   are just on that one bit of it.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.800]   There is no God.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.880]   Simple. Q.E.D.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.600]   It all goes just because...
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.760]   Now, I say a man who reasons and argues like that,
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.280]   though he may be a very learned
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.200]   and very brilliant man as such,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.120]   he's just behaving like a fool.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.360]   Well, then, look at the other evidence,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.520]   the evidence from the so-called proofs of psychology.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.240]   Of course, they say psychology now has taught us,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.480]   or psychology proves and demonstrates.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.680]   I, again, could go into this,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.880]   but we haven't the time,
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.760]   and it's not my business, in a sense, to do this.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.320]   But I'm saying all this, my dear friend,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.040]   lest there may be somebody in this congregation
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.960]   who up until this moment has said,
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   "Of course, the only people who believe in God
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.200]   "are these ignoramuses who know nothing."
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.440]   I'm simply trying to show you
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.040]   that we believe in God,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   we do know something about these things,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   and psychology has proved
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.160]   and can prove nothing at all.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.600]   Psychology is based on pure theory.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.000]   The popular psychology is based, indeed,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.120]   upon insanity and the study of insanity.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.280]   Freud's whole system is based
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.000]   upon the study of insanity, the abnormal,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   which is transferred to the normal,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.240]   and then the mighty deductions are drawn.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.760]   It's no use saying that psychology proves anything.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.120]   Psychology puts up its theories and its suppositions,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.640]   but you mustn't call that a proof.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.760]   To base your position upon that, I say,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.200]   is to behave in a foolish manner.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.600]   And then, of course, the great question of evolution.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   "Ah," they say, "of course, people used to think
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.280]   "that God had created the world
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.960]   "and God had created men,
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.600]   "but we know now that that isn't so,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.360]   "and that everything's come out of that primitive slime,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.720]   "and that came from some gases," and so on,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.600]   and back you go.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.360]   Science has established it and proved it.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.480]   Well, I've just got to say the same thing again.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.680]   It is simply a scientific statement
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.400]   to say that evolution has not proved anything.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.160]   Evolution is a theory, and nothing but a theory,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.960]   and there are many different theories of evolution,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.600]   some of which cancel one another right out.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.760]   And indeed, science proves nothing,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.920]   because there isn't such a thing as science.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.080]   And when you say science proves,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.520]   what you mean is that certain scientists say this or that,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.360]   which is a very different thing.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   But you see, on this kind of evidence,
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.800]   there are people who say, "I no longer believe in God.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.080]   "I say this is folly."
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.640]   And then comparative religion, and all these other matters,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.280]   and in every single case, the answer is the same.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   All these things about theories, suppositions,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.640]   ideas conjured up in the minds of men
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.680]   to try to explain the facts, and none of them is adequate,
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.040]   and all of them are criticized,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.320]   and there are the rival theories and the rival schools.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.240]   Now, I say that a man who draws the momentous conclusion
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.720]   that there is no God on that sort of evidence is a fool.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.040]   But look at it the other way around.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.160]   He is a man who does not truly face
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.320]   the mass of evidence on the other side.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.560]   He's doubly guilty.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.800]   He takes his little bits of evidence,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.680]   and on them he draws this momentous conclusion.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.560]   And then he doesn't face the other evidence,
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.000]   the vast, the tremendous evidence on the other side.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.200]   What do you mean, sir, someone?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.280]   Well, what I mean is this.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.560]   I rarely do mean the evidence of creation.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.960]   I rarely do mean the world in which we live.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.320]   I rarely do mean the cosmos in which we are existing.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:39.360]   Well, I confess I'm baffled that anybody should believe
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.520]   that this amazing universe in which we find ourselves
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   is but the result of accident and chance.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:53.040]   I must confess I am in many ways thrilled and I'm moved
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.760]   as I've been reading about this mysterious thing
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.720]   that has just happened and about which everybody's talking
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.040]   at the present time about this satellite.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.000]   Have you considered it?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   I'm not referring at the moment to the cleverness
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.880]   or the ability of men, but I'm referring to this,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.080]   that around our globe there is this atmosphere,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.280]   and then you can get beyond that atmosphere,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.840]   outside the earth's atmosphere,
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.880]   to this extraordinary space, as it were,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.040]   and then beyond that there's something else,
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.840]   and this globe is suspended in all this,
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.200]   and so are the others, the moon, the sun, the stars,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.480]   the constellations.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.280]   Have you thought of it?
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.320]   Have you tried to?
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.080]   The mysterious universe, as the late Sir James Jeans called it.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.880]   And I'm asked to believe that it all just happened,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.960]   that there's no mind at the back of all that.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.360]   I say it's a tremendous thing that the mind of men
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.520]   can take this satellite, as they call it,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   and shoot it up into that space,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.600]   and that there it's going round and round.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.640]   The mind of men, yes, it's tremendous.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.400]   But where does all this come from?
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.520]   And how does it all consist and hold together?
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.960]   How does it all keep going?
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:18.000]   Is all this ordered universe, this amazing cosmos,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.360]   the mere accidental fortuitous results of collisions,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   or of gases suddenly condensing?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.920]   The thing I say is unthinkable.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.800]   As a man who was privileged to learn a little bit of science,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.400]   and who still has an interest in it,
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.040]   I say my mind cannot accept such a statement.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.360]   It's madness, it's folly.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   And then look at men himself.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:50.880]   Are you really satisfied that men is an accident?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.320]   That he's just come into being?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.480]   We know not why, nor for what purpose, nor to what end.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.440]   My dear friend, you're insulting humanity.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.960]   You're insulting human nature.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.280]   You're insulting yourself.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.800]   Man stands up as a protest against it all.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.600]   There is only one explanation of man, and that's God.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.080]   Man's too big to be explained in such terms.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.160]   He's more marvelous than the cosmos itself,
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.240]   this little microcosm which we call man.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.640]   And then have you ever considered the evidence of history?
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.320]   Go and read it.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.480]   Read your secular history.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.440]   Read this Old Testament history.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.640]   Can you explain all that apart from God?
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.280]   Can you explain the Jews in particular?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.080]   The Jews at the center of the whole position at this moment?
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.160]   That little state of Israel?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.600]   I'm not preaching politics.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.840]   I'm asking you to look at these things spiritually.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.760]   Look at them.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.120]   Why have they persisted?
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.320]   Where have they come from?
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.760]   How do you explain their whole story, Old Testament and since?
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.600]   Why are they where they are at the moment?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.720]   What is this?
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.480]   I say there's only one explanation of the Jews, and that is God.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.680]   Have you ever considered the evidence of prophecy as we find it in the Old Testament?
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:28.080]   Have you ever considered the fact that there were things foretold
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.960]   800 years and more before they ever happened?
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.840]   Have you ever written down on paper the facts concerning the birth
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.680]   and the life and the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.040]   Have you gone back to the Old Testament and as he said himself,
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.560]   have you found it there, how it was predicted and prophesied?
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.480]   Going back even to Genesis 3 15 and coming right away through,
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.000]   how do you explain prophecy?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.880]   There's only one explanation.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.520]   It's God who sees the end from the beginning and who orders all things
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.640]   after the counsel of his own eternal will and wisdom.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.120]   It's God controlling history, biblical history, all history.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.640]   Have you been reading books on the latest discoveries of archaeology?
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.720]   They're confirming this biblical history.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.440]   Oh, the time fails me.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:24.000]   On top of all this evidence, I ask you to look at a person called Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.960]   He belongs to history, you know.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.480]   You all recognize that by calling this year 1957.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.440]   Yes, he did live and he died under Pontius Pilate.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.480]   He's in history.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.640]   Secular history recognizes him.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.520]   There he is.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.160]   Look at him.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.680]   How do you explain him?
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.280]   Why is his church what she is?
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.680]   Why did she become the official religion of the Roman Empire after three centuries?
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.880]   This despised sect, what is this?
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   Can you get rid of him?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.480]   There's only one way to explain him and that is God.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   And indeed, how do you explain the Christian church itself?
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.120]   And indeed, how do you explain the Christian church herself?
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.080]   Even as she is today, how do you explain her persistence?
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.520]   How do you explain the mighty revivals in her history which belong to history?
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.240]   Acknowledged in history, the reformation and these other revivals?
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.200]   How do you explain them?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.520]   They belong to the hard facts of history.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.640]   Where have they come from?
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.600]   How do you account for them?
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.320]   Can men?
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.680]   Of course they can't.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.400]   It's God.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.040]   And then finally take the great saints of the centuries.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.720]   You read the account of the greatest benefactors that this world has ever known.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.640]   And you will find that they've been men who believed in God.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.240]   We are all glad to have hospitals, aren't we?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.120]   We've got a national health service.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.000]   We are glad that there are hospitals when we or our loved ones are taken ill
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.640]   and when we need some terrible operation.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.840]   We are grateful for them.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.200]   We thank God for them.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.160]   You see, your oldest hospital in London, St. Bartholomew's,
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.400]   was founded by a religious man called Ray here over 800 years ago.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.560]   Hospitals have come from godly men, men who believe in God.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.440]   So have all your most beneficent actions, your Lord Shaftesbury's, your Wilberforce's.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.760]   These men have done what they did because of their belief in God and in Christ.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   Do away with the belief in God and you wipe out the greatest saints,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.400]   the greatest benefactors that the world has ever known.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:42.240]   That's some of the evidence that these people ignore and dismiss and say there is no God.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.520]   They draw their conclusions out of the flimsiest evidence
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.840]   and they neglect and ignore this mighty evidence.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.320]   I say a man who does that is but a fool.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.200]   But for me to close, let me put it like this.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.880]   My third reason for calling such a man a fool is
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:09.760]   that because in that way and for those two reasons that I've just been giving you,
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:19.760]   he doesn't hesitate to risk his whole eternal life and his whole eternal future.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:26.960]   Ah, but he says I don't believe there is anything after death.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.600]   My dear friend, you may not believe it, but can you prove it?
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:36.240]   And I say that a man in the light of the evidence that I've just been inducing,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.640]   who is prepared to risk it, is a fool.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.120]   A man who does anything on inadequate security is a fool.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.560]   Isn't it the sign of a fool?
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.760]   Look at the man who gambles away a fortune, the risk of fortune.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.120]   Will it stop at my number?
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.720]   He risks his whole fortune on it.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.840]   What do you say afterwards?
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.880]   A fool.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.720]   Fancy risking everything on just that or the number on a dice.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.600]   A fool who risks so much and so little.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.520]   Any man who takes momentous decisions or who risks tremendous things,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.040]   I say without inadequate, with inadequate evidence and with insufficient security,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.480]   is just a fool.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.320]   And yet, you see, this is the position.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.720]   You can't prove there isn't a life after death.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.960]   You don't know what's going to happen to you when you die.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   And yet you say I'm prepared to risk it.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.440]   Are you?
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:32.320]   What if the Bible is right and after death,
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.200]   the man who doesn't believe in God goes on to all eternity in misery and wretchedness,
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.560]   in an endless, useless remorse, kicking himself because of his utter folly.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.320]   Yes, then he will have opened his eyes and he will have seen Christ
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.680]   and he will have seen God and he will know there is a God
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.600]   and he'll see that he threw it all away and said there is no God.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   Because of some things he wanted to do.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.760]   For a moment he sold his birthright for a mess of pottage
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.520]   and for less he's jeopardized his whole eternal destiny.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:12.880]   On that flimsy evidence and on those suppositions and theories.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.480]   Oh, my dear friend, the thing is so terribly serious.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.680]   We are in this passing world and it's becoming more uncertain almost every day.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   What's going to happen next?
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.200]   If they can shoot these satellites into that outer space, what next, I say?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.960]   Men may suddenly do something and the whole universe will be shattered
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.560]   and you and I with it and in it.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.120]   What then?
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:45.360]   Not to consider that.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.160]   Not to have some grounds for your decision and for your action,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.200]   I say, is just to proclaim that you're a fool.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.080]   But you know, this is the heartbreaking thing about it.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:08.560]   If God were only just and righteous and holy.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.960]   Well, I was almost saying that in a sense there'd be some excuse for a man
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.760]   who doesn't believe in him but there wouldn't be any excuse even then.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:25.520]   But you know, the thing that makes such a man finally are not a fool.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.640]   It is when you consider what he refuses, what he rejects.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:39.040]   He wants to live this other kind of life that's so popular with the world and it seems so
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.600]   glamorous and it's going to lead to this, that and the other.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.520]   Marvelous freedom and emancipation and he's going to have his fill.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.280]   He doesn't even stop to think that when he's middle-aged he'll be rather tired of it
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.560]   and when he's an old man or when she's an old woman lying on a bed in a garret perhaps
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.360]   with everything gone like the prodigal in the far land with no one to attend to you.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.000]   They haven't even considered that still less.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.320]   Have they considered what lies beyond it?
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:14.240]   But in choosing that, look what they've rejected, look what they've spurned,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.760]   look what they've refused.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:23.120]   You know there is no life even in this world that is comparable to the godly life.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:32.000]   It's a clean life, it's a pure life, it's a holy life.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.760]   It's a life lived in fellowship and communion with God and with Christ.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:47.440]   It's a life, I say, lived amongst the people who've done the greatest amount of good in
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:54.240]   this world, I simply ask you to read, read your secular books as well as others and even
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.920]   they prove it and demonstrate it.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.600]   You see that other life is so empty.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.720]   Did you read during this past week a statement by a certain popular novelist?
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   Now an old man facing the end and he's got nothing to look forward to,
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.480]   nothing at all, how terrible.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.680]   Has been cynical towards this life, this godly life throughout his life and there he is at
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.440]   the end of his with nothing.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.320]   Of course he hasn't.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:33.040]   But this life, I say, even here and now has joys and pleasures to give unto us that the
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.240]   world doesn't know.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.920]   And as you go on in it, it gets better and better.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.880]   And as you begin to contemplate the end, you're not frightened of death and the grave, you
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.080]   don't say it's the end of everything, you say I'm going on to spend the whole of my
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.920]   time with Christ in eternity.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   And should these bombs come and should hell be let loose again, they can't harm us.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:00.400]   Why?
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.920]   Well because our real life is that hidden life which is in communion with God and Christ
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.160]   and which is in the safekeeping of God.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.320]   We are looking forward to an inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled and that
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   fadeth not away reserved in heaven by God for them who believe in him.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:29.360]   My dear friend, can't you see the folly of saying that there's no God?
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:33.520]   From every aspect it is sheer folly.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.120]   There's no other word for it.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.280]   It's the absence of understanding.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.520]   It's the absence of true reasoning.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.600]   It's sheer clear thinking.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.480]   It's folly.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:56.880]   Surely no one is going out of this service still a fool, having listened to the evidence.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:03.920]   Be wise, I humbly beseech you, and give proof that you're wise.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.600]   By telling God before you leave this very building
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.640]   that though there are still many things you don't understand,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:23.120]   you believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:29.280]   So you are coming to him to acknowledge your folly, your sin, your shame.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.960]   You're going to ask him to have mercy and he will tell you that he's had mercy,
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:41.280]   that he sent his only son to die for you and your rebellion and your sin and your everything,
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.000]   that he'll forgive you freely, take you back to himself and give you new life
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.200]   and make you his son and lead you all the way and eventually receive you into glory.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.160]   Tell him, repent, acknowledge it.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:51:01.360]   Cast yourself upon him, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.160]   and his wonderful salvation.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:10.400]   "If any man," says the Apostle Paul, "seemeth to be wise in this world,
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.880]   well then let him become a fool, become a Christian, that he may be made truly wise."
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:25.600]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.000]   Prove that you are wise.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.560]   Amen.
