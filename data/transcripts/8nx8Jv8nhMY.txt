[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Our air current energy is so expensive, especially electricity. Our energy resources,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.280]   which are basically thermal, it's quite difficult to make electricity comparatively. And so what we
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.040]   use electricity for is stuff we really want to use electricity for. So it's hard to imagine that
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.520]   we're not going to turn our air conditioner off. We're going to run it. Whereas if you look at
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.560]   really closely at a lot of the use cases that use tons of extra energy, they're much more flexible
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.080]   in how they use the energy. And there's not a whole lot of storage involved. If you're looking
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   at growing crops, or making methane for rocket fuel, or making chemicals, you can design these
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.120]   processes to run when the energy is available. You're basically getting to the point where
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.720]   you're making batteries out of dirt. Because that's how you scale it. It's just how many
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   battery factories you want to build.
