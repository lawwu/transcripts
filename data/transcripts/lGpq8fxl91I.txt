[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   If there's one thing I want the audience to like really, really understand is that so far in the last seven years, I've had zero downsides of being public.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Zero.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   This fear of exposing your privacy is an irrational fear.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:27.200]   I've shared how much money I make, where I live, who I date, how I date, everything about my life, and every time I share more, I literally get rewarded more.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.080]   I get rewarded more.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.760]   It's crazy.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   People love you more.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.560]   People want to help you more.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.840]   I think we need to get into this culture of like sharing what you really are going through, because you never know who's listening on the other side that is dying for somebody else to relate with.
