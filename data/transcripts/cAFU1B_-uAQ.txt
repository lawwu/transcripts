[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Brent emails a very simple question, but a direct one.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   Pastor John, do you ever doubt the existence of God?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:23.120]   The thought that God doesn't exist enters my mind periodically, and when
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.800]   you're reading atheistic literature, it's kind of put there. But what I would say
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.360]   is it doesn't get traction in my mind. It lodges there, it sort of rumbles
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   around. You ask it, you ponder it, you look at it, and by God's merciful grace, it
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.800]   doesn't hook. You know, it's not like a hook in a fish's mouth. It
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.360]   goes in your mouth, and you just keep it open. It goes out of your mouth instead
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.200]   of you come down on it, and then it hooks you right in the jaw. It never has hooked
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.720]   me, and therefore it never has destroyed me or undone my ministry. And when
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.440]   I try to - let me just describe my experience a little bit so that maybe the person
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.320]   will be able to handle his own doubts. I was walking to church one day,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.960]   having meditated on Romans 1, where it says what can be known about God
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.680]   is obvious to them in the things that have been made. So God - Paul says in
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.520]   Romans 1, people do know God. They know God from the things that have been made,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   but they repress the knowledge. So I was pondering, okay, if that's true, then John
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   Piper knows God by the things that have been made. And I looked at this tree
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.160]   right across the street from our church, right between the two big tall towers
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.800]   there. It's just an incredible big tall tree, and I just looked at it and I thought, sap
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.920]   has to get to the top of those branches, and there's no pump in that tree. There's
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.280]   no motor. How's that happen? And then I thought about those limbs right now in
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.600]   March look as dead as a doornail, and in two months they are going to be waving
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.280]   and pulsating with green, beautiful, shaped, leafy life. How in the world? And
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   I went on pondering this, and I thought, I cannot not believe in God. That's what I
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.040]   felt. I just felt I cannot not do it. I can't do it. I can't deny God. It's not as
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.760]   though I'm trying hard to deny. I'm just not able to deny. And then another way it
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.360]   works for me is that when I look at Jesus, I read the Gospels, and when I find
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.160]   Jesus talking and doing, I find C.S. Lewis is, this guy's an absolute deceiver, liar,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:10.680]   or this guy is a lunatic, or this guy is son of God. And emotionally, I'm just not
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   able. God has so worked in my heart so that when I look at Jesus as he's
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   presented in the Gospels, I am not able to call him a liar. I'm not able to call
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.240]   him a lunatic. I have to bow and say, "You are God. You know God, and you represent
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.960]   God, and you embody God." And I feel the same way. I've never heard people unpack
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.520]   this the way I feel it. I feel the same way about the Apostle Paul. I've
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.360]   never heard anybody say, "Liar, lunatic, or faithful representative." But that's the
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.440]   way I feel. I read Paul, all 13 letters, and I love the man, I trust the man, I
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   admire the man, I reverence the man, and I cannot bring myself to say, "He's a
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.320]   knucklehead. He was swept away by some kind of experience that was unreal. He's
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   just too rational. He's too reasonable. He's too loving. He's too caring. He's too
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   authentic." The man can't be the kind of idiot he'd have to be if he was
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.680]   putting forth a mythological system of salvation that had no bearing, or no
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:36.240]   roots, in reality. So God has used trees and galaxies and Jesus and Paul, and I
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.360]   haven't, by grace, had to take those things and say, "Oh, oh please, cause God
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   to be real in my life." I've simply not been able to escape his reality. Thank
