[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.160]   All right.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.440]   Moving on, we have a question from Omar.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.800]   Omar asks, how do you study self-study technical things
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.960]   well enough to be employable?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.680]   For example, programming or data analysis.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840]   He elaborates that he currently works in sales,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440]   but is looking to make the switch over
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.080]   to software engineering.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.160]   In his sales job, he's doing a bunch of just emails
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.440]   and following up with prospects.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.960]   So Omar, I'm going to say--
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.000]   I mean, I see in your elaboration
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.200]   you say you don't want to spend a ton of money.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.120]   You don't want to go back to school.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.880]   I think that's OK.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.800]   I think you should spend some money.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.220]   You should spend some money so that you are making yourself
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.720]   accountable.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200]   Hey, I spent money on this training I'm about to do,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.320]   so I'm going to show up.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   Also, I'm signaling to myself that I take this seriously.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.360]   I'm not dabbling.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.680]   I really do want to pick up this skill.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.480]   I would say spend some money.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.840]   So what do I mean by some money?
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.120]   Well, probably in this case, some sort of boot camp.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.740]   It's going to take place over a fixed amount of time.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.660]   You're going to master a particular language.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.080]   You're going to get a particular certification.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.240]   You probably need to do an introductory boot camp,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.240]   and then you're going to need to do some sort of training
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360]   at a higher level after that.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.400]   Spend some money on that.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.600]   Don't do something that's free.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.140]   Again, you want to signal to yourself
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.320]   you take this seriously.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.880]   Two, ultimately, you need to produce real things.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.960]   It's the best way to learn.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840]   It's the best way to show other people
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.880]   you know what you're doing.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.360]   So you're going to need some sort of actual projects
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.320]   that you're doing on the side, perhaps,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   to show I can actually program.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.160]   But more importantly, that's how you're really
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.560]   going to learn how to do it.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.360]   I built this project.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.040]   This took me a long time.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   I was constantly Googling things.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.960]   It's constantly on Stack Overflow.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.880]   Oh, but then I did this next project.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.040]   Wasn't so hard.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.200]   And the third one I did on my own,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.400]   I think it looks pretty nice.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.320]   OK, now I think I'm ready.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.600]   The final thing I'm going to say is
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   be ready to begin at a basic level if you switch jobs.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.480]   A lot of good coders out there, a lot of people
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.720]   to choose from for these jobs.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.400]   So that you might be actually starting at a pretty low level,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.280]   technically speaking.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.240]   And say, that's OK, because here's my plan.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   I'm going to get after it once I have that job.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm going to crush the low level stuff they tell me to do,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   the easier programming.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.760]   I can do it really, really well with a level of skill
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.400]   and polish that they don't quite expect.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.880]   And then I'm going to use that to leverage up
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.840]   to the next level, the next level.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800]   So I'm going to leverage myself level to level to level.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.240]   So in a year, I will actually be at a pretty good spot.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.280]   So you want to be coming into this being like,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   I want to learn enough to get a technical job that
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.600]   would allow me in one year to be in the job I want.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   So to be in a job and be working your way up
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   to a higher position is much more productive than just being
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.800]   on your own for that time, just trying to on your own polish
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.560]   your skills.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.260]   So let's summarize the three points here.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.400]   One, spend some money.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   I'm not talking about tuition and to get
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   a separate undergrad degree.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.800]   But spend some money for a non-trivial boot camp.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.760]   You probably need to do two levels of training.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.840]   Two, build things.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.880]   Build things until you can build things that look pretty good,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.200]   at a pretty high quality, and it wasn't like pulling teeth.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.480]   You're not Googling where does the semicolon go in a C++ for
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.000]   loop.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.040]   You have that stuff.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.120]   You're not praying and compiling,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   compiling and praying, something we
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   see a lot in intro computer science classes.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   You're like, I don't know, compile.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   Ah, errors.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.980]   Let me just change things randomly.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.520]   Still errors?
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.680]   Like you're past that stage.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.200]   Fine.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.760]   And then get hired not for the job you want,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   but for the job that will make it possible for you
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.080]   to get the job you want a year later if you get after it,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   if you deliberately practice, if you prove your worth.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.040]   All right?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760]   So Omar, I'm glad you're making the shift.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920]   I haven't read all the details on air
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.680]   that you sent me here about your current job,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.160]   but man, it sounds like it's just context switching central.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.720]   It's just email all day long.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.920]   Yeah, let's get out of there.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.320]   Let's get you somewhere better, somewhere deeper.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.720]   I love the way you're thinking.
