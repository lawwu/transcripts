[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   - You've mentioned that we just might make contact
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.780]   with aliens or at least hear from them within the century.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.000]   Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   - Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.020]   - Of course.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.240]   - But given the fact that we've already identified
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.760]   4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.600]   and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960]   for the first time, we know that on average,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.680]   every single star on average has a planet going around it,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   and about one fifth or so of them
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   have Earth-sized planets going around them.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.000]   So just do the math.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.180]   We're talking about out of 100 billion stars
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.880]   in the Milky Way galaxy, we're talking about billions
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.960]   of potential Earth-sized planets.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.800]   And to believe that we're the only one
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.640]   And how many galaxies are there?
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.600]   Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.920]   there are about 100 billion galaxies.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.720]   So do the math.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.520]   How many stars are there in the visible universe?
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.520]   100 billion galaxies times 100 billion stars per galaxy,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.760]   we're talking about a number beyond human imagination.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.520]   And to believe that we're the only ones,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.240]   I think, is rather ridiculous.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.200]   - So you've talked about different types of,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.520]   type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.320]   even, of the Kardashev scale
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.480]   of the different kind of civilizations.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.620]   What do you think it takes, if it is indeed
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.240]   a ridiculous notion that we're alone in the universe,
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.760]   what do you think it takes to reach out,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.700]   first to reach out through communication and connect?
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.360]   - Well, first of all, we have to understand
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.760]   the level of sophistication of an alien life form,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.520]   if we make contact with them.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.200]   I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.440]   signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.300]   We'll pick up their "I love Lucy"
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.320]   and their "Leave it to Beaver,"
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.640]   just ordinary day-to-day transmissions that they emit.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.240]   And the first thing we want to do is to, A,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   decipher their language, of course,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.000]   but B, figure out at what level they are advanced
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.120]   on the Kardashev scale.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.600]   I'm a physicist.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.360]   That's how we rank black holes, that's how we rank stars,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.640]   that's how we rank civilizations in outer space.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   So a type one civilization is capable
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560]   of harnessing planetary power.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.000]   They control the weather, for example.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   Earthquakes, volcanoes,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.640]   they can modify the course of geological events,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.440]   sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.160]   Type two would be stellar.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.660]   They play with stars, entire stars.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.480]   They use the entire energy output of a star,
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.600]   sort of like Star Trek.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.680]   The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.120]   So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   Type three would be galactic.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.880]   They roam the galactic space lanes.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.720]   And type three would be like Star Wars,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.920]   a galactic civilization.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.360]   Now, one day I was giving this talk in London
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.960]   at the planetarium there,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.080]   and the little boy comes up to me and he says,
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.760]   "Professor, you're wrong.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.040]   "You're wrong, there's type four."
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.320]   And I told him, "Look, kid,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.960]   "there are planets, stars, and galaxies.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.760]   "That's it, folks."
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.840]   And he kept persisting and saying,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   "No, there's type four, the power of the continuum."
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.600]   And I thought about it for a moment,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.560]   and I said to myself,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.200]   "Is there an extra galactic source of energy,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.560]   "the continuum of Star Trek?"
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.120]   And the answer is yes, there could be a type four,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.080]   and that's dark energy.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.600]   is dark energy.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.680]   Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   and we only represent 4%.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.640]   We're the oddballs.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.200]   And so you begin to realize that,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.800]   yeah, there could be type four, maybe even type five.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.320]   - So type four, you're saying being able to harness
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.400]   sort of like dark energy,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.200]   something that permeates the entire universe.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.040]   So be able to plug into the entire universe
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   as a source of energy.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.880]   - That's right, and dark energy
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.720]   is the energy of the Big Bang.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.960]   It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.760]   It's the energy of nothing.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.600]   The more nothing you have,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.420]   the more dark energy that's repulsive.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.980]   And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.600]   because the more you have, the more you can have.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.760]   It's called the de Sitter expansion,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.280]   and that's the current state of the universe.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
