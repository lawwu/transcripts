[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.440]   was that journey like for you yeah so yeah i started coming because uh one of my high school friends
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   older brothers uh was part of our group back then he was a fifth year senior he gave me a new student
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   welcome night flyer and so i did i went around to different clubs and i came to our new student welcome
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   night i was 20 minutes late um but i got in time i got there just in time for the mask skit the original
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   mass skit and i was like wow this is actually well done and this is a christian group amazing
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.760]   um and it was like really funny and and and i thought profound and so um i was like wow uh that
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.480]   was good did you go to church i grew up going to church yeah and so i was kind of looking for a
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.680]   church halfway you know um and uh i stumbled upon our group and then um we had kli burger night which
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.400]   was our sport what our sports nights were called back then it's maxwell it was it's now called
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   maxwell family deal night but now it's called kli burger night maxwell i had a lot of fun so yeah
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.920]   that's how i first came to our church yeah so i didn't grow up going to church um but end of my
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.760]   senior year my aunt died from cancer i was kind of asking questions about life and um things like
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.920]   that i kind of hit a low because senior year you know you like that was like kind of you know i was
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.640]   president of a few clubs i got a lot of awards and things like that but i also saw my sinfulness
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.320]   through different choices that i had made that i regretted um so i actually started going to church
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.840]   my senior year with a friend yeah high school in high school yeah i went twice i mean by started going
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   i went twice and uh there was a low point where i went to church by myself just this little white
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   steeple church um and i saw that it started at 11 it was like 10 55 so i just stuck in there and that
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   pastor preached on the prodigal son and i thought you know if god is like that like that father then i
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.360]   want to know who he is so coming into college that was my mindset i was like i gotta i want to learn about
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.240]   this god you know so actually in high school my non-christian friends bought me a bible because
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.920]   we were talking about all this essential stuff yeah they're like you know we heard that people go to
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.960]   the bible when you have these kind of questions so i tried reading it and like open it up it was like
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.160]   leviticus or something like i need some help right so coming into college i was looking at christian
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.600]   groups and i actually went to a lot of christian um tables so i introduced myself i was like hi you
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.120]   know and i think most people assume you're christian already so you know i didn't really make meaningful
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.400]   connections but then i get to get a flyer for welcome night and it's susan iskandar from minnesota
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.880]   and she's warm and friendly and engages me and i write on that flyer like i have to go to this one
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.720]   and then i wanted to be a teacher at that time so she walked me over to the table and i met emily kim
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.000]   who was in grad school to be a teacher at that time i thought she was like the coolest person so i wrote
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.560]   i was like must go to this group you know like cool people so i went to welcome night i was really
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.440]   blown away yeah by the messages so i think most of my freshman year i mostly only came for the content
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.800]   and then i left right after because i had other friends other activities they were really cool but
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.600]   i don't want to hang out with them yeah i did you know go to their place and stuff but it was just like
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   but i always made sure i made it to the bible study and then eventually to church um so pastor ed was
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.320]   teaching like i just soaked everything up i thought the truths were so profound and it described life
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.080]   you know as i had experienced it so i didn't know what i didn't have the word sin in my vocabulary
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.640]   but i had experienced the effects of sin you know and so when pastor ed put a label on it and described
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.760]   you know our brokenness i just thought that's so true like this is exactly what i experienced
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.640]   and then that experience of like yeah god is like this father you know and so it took course 101
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   the middle of freshman year i became a christian um and then it was kind of was it like a special event
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.160]   or anything it was just kind of it was a sunday sunday service yeah just i forget exactly the passage
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   you know it's one of those like like i'm ready like i'm ready like i understand um yeah and then
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.480]   then that that's it yeah for like did you um become christian or church was it before like
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.000]   what was kind of that spiritual journey like for you through college yeah i think growing up going to
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.480]   church i came into college uh looking for independence and freedom and kind of looking to walk away um in
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.920]   some ways and at least open to the idea very open to the idea but before i walked away i felt like i
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.680]   should at least figure out to see it um whether or not there's any merit to it and so i took course 101
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   and um pastor ed's messages uh they were unusual to me in a lot of ways um but i got at least one thing
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.120]   most of the time but the thing that struck me the most was just the authenticity with the way uh
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.400]   in the way that people lived out their faith and so that struck me and that kept me coming to see
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.480]   like there must be something here um i took a little bit longer and so i made my clear salvation
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.960]   decision in my junior year so it was probably kind of right around the same time since we're two years
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.360]   apart yeah but i think my junior year was the time where i really saw my sinfulness for the first time
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.640]   clearly and owned it for myself knew that i couldn't fix it on my own through just my own like ability to
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.960]   work around it or to stop it and then um that's when the cross became um the most meaningful to me so
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   so you guys been doing by vocational ministry for gosh how long for you now since 2002 so that's
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.840]   over 20 years 22 years now yeah so i have a working a full-time job yeah what did you guys do before
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.880]   becoming fit like so i was i'll go first because it's not as impressive
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:32.080]   i was a teacher um and then i became a technical writer um and how i got that job was
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:39.840]   Eunice they wanted to hire Eunice she's like i can't take Eunice Kim she's like um i'm about to like go plant a
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.640]   church so you can't hire me but i know this sister and then i go to the job interview and on my resume
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.160]   it's like i wrote for our website yeah they're like you write for pastor ed i was like yeah but it turns
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.840]   out like they went hiring the hiring manager knew of pastor yeah because pastor spoke at a retreat
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.920]   for like a korean church when they were in college or postgrad so then i got the job so that's how i
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.680]   made the transition from teaching to writing yeah oh actually that's interesting because my first job
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.960]   out of college i got through genie oh oh you did i did the video side of her tech writing wow i forgot
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.040]   about that but yeah that's uh it's interesting it's all about it's all about who you know yeah oh i
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.120]   guess i should thank my dad i guess that's interesting um and then yeah sure um after college i went to
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   law school and i worked as an attorney um most recently i worked as for the state as an administrative
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.880]   law judge um and yep that's what it is is it true that you would show up to like all the college events
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.760]   with your suit yeah like your first like your judge no no no no this is the first few years where i had
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.880]   to wear a suit to work every day okay and i was working long hours so right when i got out of the
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.560]   office i would head straight to berkeley go to campus and just participated in whatever we were doing that
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   day and so if it was bible study i'd go to bible study in my suit if it was dining hall outreach i'd do
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   that in my suit if it was ultimate frisbee i'd roll up my sleeves roll up my pant legs and just run out
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.360]   there with a lot of suits with all the freshmen yeah probably outran a lot yeah so you guys oh
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.200]   go now i was just gonna say funny story about the suit thing so when we first started dating we i mean
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.840]   i knew of him we didn't know each other that well so and he called me i was like oh sure why not because
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.440]   i knew him as like someone that was like a hard-working brother in our midst but anyway we go to our first
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.760]   date and he's like in a suit and tie and i didn't know that he wore it all the time for work you know so i'm
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:49.120]   like feeling really confident like wow like this guy's a tryhard he's trying really hard he's just
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.360]   trying hard and that's what she liked he must be really into me right so that so it was a good first
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.440]   impression it was good because you know i was kind of nervous you know and then i was like i'm feeling
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.760]   confident okay i think it's gonna go well were you able to tell yeah like this girl's no i was really
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   nervous too you know right right after i did yeah and then i was like he wears a suit everywhere he goes
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   even when he really should not be in a suit yeah that's true wow wow i think the guys listening to
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.920]   this podcast should take notes they should wear a suit on your first date yeah yeah so you guys well
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:33.440]   let's talk about that a little bit so your guys relationship so um best and worst date story do

[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.720]   we were pretty in a busy season of life so like i worked a teaching job it was like a one hour commute
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   he was at a really hard law firm and we were both busy with ministry so it was hard to like plug in time
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.080]   you know so there was like a stretch where it was like okay let's find a time to me just couldn't

[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.720]   week to meet me you know but because we got engaged it washed away the yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:02.480]   that's so funny yeah that's so funny so that's funny so you have you have any like positive
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.400]   stories you want to balance that out with or yeah anytime you didn't meet i'm just like
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.200]   i did want to ask you a little bit more about like the bivocational ministry things so
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   um just like as a college senior what was what what made you stick around and you know decided to do
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.760]   ministry here and for as long as you did two decades i guess for both of you um yeah what went into that
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:34.160]   decision i think um there were a few pivotal like moments in underground that really changed my like
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.400]   it was a paradigm shift for me um one of them was uh going on mission trip to japan you know and um not
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.560]   only just going on the mission trip but the summer the summer before i went um we sent a team and and
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:55.040]   just seeing how um japan could be the most efficient orderly you know society and yet produce so much
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.920]   lostness and brokenness amongst its people that really struck me you know and it and and then i had
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.200]   you know internships in college and things like that worked with like really smart successful people
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.920]   and when i took a look at what their lives were really about it was like just for the weekends it was
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:17.440]   like their wine collection or something like that and in my mind i was pretty ambitious as an undergrad
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:26.000]   but i was like man am i gonna burn all of my years and energy you know just to just for like a wine
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.440]   collection you know and i and so i just saw the emptiness of of that kind of life and and what
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.120]   that would look like you know 10 20 years down the line but also seeing that really society has no other
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.800]   answer you know um seeing how lost uh even the japanese people are you know and japanese college
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.320]   students and so um at that point i personally just felt like man yeah the gospel is the hope of the
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.200]   world you know and so it's just something that i wanted to commit to doing and i haven't seen
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:01.760]   ministry done anywhere else like our church does you know um and so i just wanted to be a part of that you
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.880]   know to experience um the way that god was um reaching people um at our church um in a way that
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.080]   i hadn't seen in any other way and so um yeah i i was thrilled to be a part of that what year was
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:21.280]   that when you went to japan uh i went in i went the summer of 2001 was that the famous olympic center
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.480]   no no no no no i went for the whole summer actually oh wow so it wasn't just a two-week thing but i got
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.280]   to go for the whole summer i lived at uh tony sun's house oh that's when they were there yeah that was
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   when yeah and so stefan and philip were like little yeah you know runs running around there um
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.640]   but we had a lot of fun and it was uh it was a really wonderful experience uh yeah so
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:51.680]   yeah i think my um choice to stay at college it was like more tenuous you know yeah i actually left
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.920]   so i went four and a half years in college and then i went home for a semester because
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.640]   to help my family out yeah um and then i wasn't sure if i was going to actually come back to our church
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.920]   but then i got to grad school and then i came back um but i think it was over time so you asked earlier
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.640]   like people we ministered to i think it was as i was doing ministry that my heart for college ministry
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.200]   specifically grew so you know i'm the only christian in my family and so that was like a big burden yeah
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.880]   um college ministry i wasn't sure like i would be really into that i love like children you know i
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.520]   wanted to be a teacher enjoy youth so so it wasn't the demographic but i knew that i wanted to do some
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.040]   kind of ministry so you know in undergrad i read about like heroes of faith and so that was always in
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.960]   my mind yeah i'm a christian i want to share the gospel um but yeah staying at our church serving
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:53.200]   like that was kind of like i'm not sure you know like i still had trouble with like just church life
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.520]   because it was just you know at the end of the day like it was not something i was used to
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:04.960]   you know for most of my life and i don't know if anyone's yeah yeah so but as i grew you know some
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:12.640]   of the first classes was one class that stands out to me is like 2014 like helen zoo casey um they were
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.960]   so fun like i had so much every day yeah i had so much fun with them we had like road trips and they were
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:27.840]   you know just kind of um helping them grow um really saw helped me see yeah just how um fulfilling
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.120]   you know sharing the gospel and leading people and then also as i got older and more mature i realized
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.920]   like how much was given to me i think that took me time to see um and seeing how yeah if i had not
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:47.920]   you know been like a recipient of so so much of people's sacrifices from people that ministered to me to
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   people that just gave to the environment you know like tithe so that we could have like these home
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   getaway homes or you know even i remember like pastor donathan giving up like harvard and that
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.440]   like set a new standard for me like wow he he could have done that but he's here and he's preaching and
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.680]   he's teaching and you know um and yeah passing on wisdom you know to people like me you know and so i think
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.840]   as i just matured my convictions grew um but it definitely it was kind of like i'll try it out
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   and see how it goes for for a little while wow i really yeah i love how in both your stories sort of
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.160]   cover the gamut you know that there's people who like right away like i know this is what i want to
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.640]   do and i want to be part of that you know and you have an experience of being disillusioned by you
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.520]   know working life you're on a mission trip well often part of that story and then you realize wow this is
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.520]   what i want to do and then you got like the i'm not really sure about this there's some real things
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.160]   i'm not used to and i don't know and you kind of go in going maybe a year you know i'll just test it
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.560]   out and then your heart gets really you know captured by ministry and seeing people transform
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.960]   and i think um i think there's a lot there that uh everyone in our network can identify with and
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.520]   encourage um maybe you can speak into a little bit just a one more thing on this bivocational thing
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.960]   um you know uh 22 years that's a long time so what are some things that like like were challenging
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.080]   about it and then like got better like over time like maybe in a long-term view or or yeah just
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.360]   something that where you could speak to someone who's maybe in the thick of that challenge if you
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.240]   like it gets better you know like we're like you know encourage them a little bit you know yeah yeah
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.520]   oh yeah i'll be honest because i want to encourage some sisters out there
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.920]   you know um like i was a mess of a person in college right like my room like i had my laundry
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.680]   on my bed you know and then when i had to go to sleep sometimes i'd put on my desk it was like back up
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.880]   you know it was like i just could not keep track of my schedule like i just couldn't get life done
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.240]   just some guys are like this too okay yeah that does not make me feel better you know that some guys are
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.080]   like i'm just saying like yeah yeah that's where i started you know i don't have a lot of like
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   discipline or habits and so going into working life becoming a mom like leading a ministry like that all
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:16.880]   catches up with you you know so i think like the hardest part is like just maintaining like an orderly
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:23.760]   life while doing ministry and leading people and meeting different needs you know um i wouldn't
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.680]   say that that's the hardest part because there's other hard things like you know like people break
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   you know break your heart and like you know things like that but i think in terms of being bivocational
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:41.360]   or co-vocational and doing ministry you are busy you are busy and um there's some things that you just
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.160]   need to get better at with life and that's where i experienced a lot of strength like coming from
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.720]   the outside you know like just yeah learning to be more structured and disciplined um actually it got
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:01.040]   a lot better after we got married you know because i because he's very disciplined then you know sometimes
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:10.320]   clean up you know after me a little bit just a little bit that helped yeah yeah um yeah i think um i remember
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.560]   early uh when i started first started working well there was that six month period where i was like
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:24.160]   tired all the time you know because i just entered the working world even though i was 28 at the time
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.960]   you know i felt like i was a 23 year old you know just starting to um learn how to get into the office
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.760]   do all my work and you know perform okay and and all that stuff and um so i think doing that and then
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:46.720]   at that time i was um i was with calvin's peers and so leading a life group as well um and so it's cool
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.760]   because calvin's in the yeah yeah calvin the program and um later we led 2014 which is brian mouse
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.680]   yeah so it's a really neat intergenerational kind of very different than when we did yeah i guess
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:08.160]   anyway um and so to like but to get everything done and still prioritize my spiritual disciplines
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.880]   like there's a season where i just like skimped on that you know and it bit me in the end because i just
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:20.240]   felt thinned out and like um it just wasn't good for me you know and so i think to going back to like
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.280]   the getting what's important done instead of just the urgent you know like your dt never feels urgent
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.360]   you know um but it's so important you know and to to get into a regular rhythm and habit of making
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.960]   sure that i have that solitude time with god first before doing any of the other things i think that
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.520]   was a challenge but it got easier over time as i submitted the schedule and i just personally became
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.680]   more disciplined but also as i really saw the value of having those disciplines in place first you
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.160]   know before anything else and so i think me like i can execute things and get things done you know
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.600]   but do it in such a way that it becomes very mechanical you know and so to be able to like have
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.440]   those times where i'm engaging my heart you know while getting those things done or you know
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.600]   letting some things drop you know in order to prioritize kind of heart engagement you know
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.720]   i think that is something that was difficult in the beginning just because i thought i could do
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.800]   everything because i was young and i was brash you know but over time you know just seeing the reality
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:31.760]   and what i needed and what my limitations were i think that became easier over time yeah wow so you guys
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.920]   were at berkeley riverside apu and pomona is that right yeah are we missing any yeah yeah
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   yeah you guys have a favorite campus
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.040]   hmm oh yeah i can't see that
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   it's virtual man i love i love them all
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:54.320]   all right you don't have to tell us but tell us after the show um you want to get into the fit lit thing yeah yeah
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:01.040]   yeah so so fit lit uh lit stands for leads and training like i said and um yeah getting a year
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.800]   training it's a program that it's like a second time we're doing the first time was with us we were
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   the guinea pigs and you know um and so um what he changed a lot from our program it has changed a lot
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:18.960]   it's like upgrade i don't know what that says about us but a lot changed we were beta yeah um uh why did
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.640]   you sign up for yeah i was curious about that because it's not like you had a good thing going
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.800]   you're just why make that switch now 22 years yeah yeah you know um it was a little bit of a surprise
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.440]   that uh we were even asked to be part of the program given our age but um you know pastor had emailed us
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:44.800]   and it was i i still kind of remember because he emailed on a sunday and i was finishing my message
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   and i saw his email come in but i was like i cannot read this right now and then did you see
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.240]   the subject line you knew what it was well no i didn't i was like oh it's something important but
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.600]   i'm not going to look at it right now i have to preach and then she texted me she's like what do you
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.040]   want to do right and so we were going to talk about it right but i was like i cannot talk about it
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:10.480]   so um but i think the morning stress yeah i think the opportunity just to be trained by
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.520]   pestering kelly in a focused way yeah you know um uh was just an opportunity we didn't want to pass up
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.440]   and then we had concerns because um where pomona ministry was we just felt like we needed to be
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.080]   there but then rick and sue had been with us for a long time and they kind of knew what the ministry was
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.720]   like and and what the state of it was and so um they thought it would be okay for us to um leave pomona
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:40.080]   and be part of this program so that gave us some extra reassurance too but just uh just the opportunity
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:49.200]   to um to just surrender and to put our yes on the table and you know to um be trained because i
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.120]   think i personally also felt like after three years of leading pomona ministry as a bible i was
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:02.640]   right up at the edge of my leadership kind of capability you know and like um and so i felt like
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:08.160]   it was something we we needed to do as well you know so yeah it was it was good timing and um
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:16.320]   yeah so i think that's the main reason why we yeah so i had stopped working in 2017 already
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:24.400]   and working for church um and so my when we got the invite i was like wow they like actually won us
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:30.720]   that was why because i thought i just thought are you sure we were just like kind of older already
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:41.600]   anyway but i think um but prior to that i was kind of reaching um i think my just capacity like kind
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:51.760]   of a ceiling um and then as their retirement coming up yeah it was like shoot like you know like i gotta grow
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.600]   so i think i was mostly motivated by personal growth especially as you know in our context
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:04.480]   before we had a lot of older ones with you had a lot of heart a lot of zeal you know and i really wanted
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:12.320]   to help them grow as well but um i felt like i i need to i need to grow first and like kind of understand
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.720]   or just yeah just grow just grow and so yeah i didn't know we didn't really know what was gonna
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:24.480]   happen when we got here but um we were excited to be with you know pastor and kelly i think one of the
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.720]   reasons i actually stayed on staff for so long even when i struggled was just like meeting with them i
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:37.120]   like ministry didn't have to go well you know like i didn't have to enjoy everything but every time we had
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.160]   meetings or i met with them i would learn something you know about myself or about the world and just
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.600]   grow wiser and so i just yeah i was looking forward to that having that time again so how's it how's
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.960]   it been yeah and what's like what's the program like because i don't know what's the usual day yeah
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.800]   yeah yeah what's the day there's no usual day that's the usual there's no usual week
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.960]   no no there are some usual days there's like a default day okay what's the default week where a
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.720]   lot of times we just spend uh being available at hb for anything that needs to happen and so
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.080]   that in and of itself is like the wild card right because we were like last week we were anticipating oh
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.920]   well but so we would be doing some bible reading reading c.s lewis you know things like that those are the
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.200]   regular things yeah those are the regular reading always like bible um c.s lewis time and then we
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.360]   have our own projects by our cohorts within the fitlet program so we're project man we're doing studio
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:40.160]   nova you know helping that get launched yeah um the guys do btt also we do btt bible user training you
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.840]   know but like last week we got pulled into making the tent um at hb so that wasn't new yeah yeah it's
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   like 10 hour 10 hour days yeah so yeah to beat the rain so yeah but our default is to be here at
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:58.640]   hb and kind of do some of that kind of um you know bible readings c.s lewis and btt and projects
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:06.560]   but man we've gone we've done everything from clean every cabin at jp to going to new york city and
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.280]   you know um trying out a lot of different ministry playbooks out there yeah you guys are going to
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:18.160]   see a lot of the country and just a lot of campuses and yeah yeah work atlanta yeah we went to new york
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:26.400]   and then during that boston northeast trip went to boston and hit yale yukon um amherst along the way
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:33.600]   and went to atlanta then we went to the midwest and uiuc and yeah madison we get a little like updates
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.920]   like oh the fitlets are doing uh evangelism road trip over here and there and on one hand it could
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.040]   seem like a lot of like just travel but like what has gone going out what has that done for your
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.560]   perspective on ministry and your heart like can you speak into that a little bit just oh man i i think
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.000]   definitely the erts have been like a highlight of my experience because you know it's not like we're
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.440]   not engaged in gospel sharing but you know when you're like a kind of older leader like you're not
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.400]   sharing the gospel that often like directly to people because you're like yeah helping the people who are
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.120]   doing yeah and you're doing like logistics or having meetings and counseling and things like that
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.640]   so i think seeing different contexts and like just sharing the gospel again and again that's one thing
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:23.280]   we all did you know um like it just reminded it just kind of brought me back to first love and like
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:29.600]   wanting to be out like yeah out in the field i think so one thing that's done for me is like yeah you know
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.320]   you gotta just go and like something will happen you know because i think prior to that it's like yeah
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.440]   you know you have your plans and you have your google doc not that that's not needed you know for like
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.120]   events that we do but there's this other thing that we experience where it's like you know in the gospels
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.160]   like jesus does it you know they don't have like google docs he's just like hey guys we're going over
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.760]   the lake you know like he knows there's a demoniac across the lake but like the other guys they don't
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.720]   know they're just you probably should not put that on the calendar yeah but that's what we experience
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:09.520]   it's like we don't know who's there but but god knows you know he knows like this random you know
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:15.040]   this like attorney walking down the street she stops and i get to share the gospel with her and she's
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:20.640]   been thinking about god even though she's from china you know we meet like another um chinese kid he's
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:28.400]   read like half the bible wow you know and so i think just experiencing that um just humbled me
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.720]   and just made me see again like we just need to go out there because god knows like who's he can make
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:41.920]   things happen and orchestrate situations and um you know and like calvin nestor and um our midwest trip
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.240]   you know we they met two people that were just ready to accept christ like who knew you know yeah
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.280]   yeah yeah i remember that like when we moved out to philly together that those first like that first
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.840]   year definitely felt like oh we're just joining in on things that god has already been doing and we just
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:03.440]   need to be willing to do that so that's really neat yeah i'm curious like as you've done these erts
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.240]   and i mean like we've we i think i feel like we've learned a lot indirectly from your guys erts like
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.920]   the lesson about hey like when you do outreach do it all together don't be on like a sad pair on the
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   corner like so we've like really adopted some of those things but as you do that um how is it
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.040]   shifting your perspective about like a ministry like any ideas like when you go back into ministry
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.160]   and you're back on the college campus in normal capacity like any ideas like how you might do things
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.040]   differently or things you want to try now as as you're you know observing these campuses and going out
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:41.440]   i would i would um attempt more even if it's not like a tried and true kind of a thing you know like
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.640]   we wanted to put on a some kind of an event where people can come to you know but we're like man we
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   don't even have a room how are we going to do that and so we just brought the special talk to them you
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.640]   know um made a handout for it and just asked people while we were firing hey you have five minutes we can
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:06.160]   sit down and talk about this topic and um and so one of the the the neatest pictures was uh when about
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:16.480]   10 of us were on campus at the university of wisconsin and there were about 10 special talks happening right
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.240]   there you know in either one-on-one or one-on-two one-on-three you know things like that and so
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.720]   um just to try something you know on campus and to be out there more i mean that's you'll you'll you'll
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.680]   meet spiritually hungry people you know as you're out there so um i would make that more of a regular
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.000]   part of our schedule you know we'll go out there and we'll table but you know sometimes it's just
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.160]   flattering for an event and that needs to happen too right but to be able to go out there and you know
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:50.320]   um try a little bit more or something a little bit different to have like uh richer spiritual
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:57.360]   engagement um i think sometimes i felt like oh man it's not really gonna there's like who's gonna
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:04.080]   really stop for this or something like that but man a lot of people stopped and were engaged in kind
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.160]   of really rich conversations yeah yes i don't know if you've been feeling this but i've definitely been
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   feeling this so at rutgers we've been trying to just go out you know twice a week and do outreach and
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.400]   definitely feel like people are more spiritually hungry like i can't prove that to you but i
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.720]   definitely feel it and sort of the sort of the challenge is like they're more spiritually hungry
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.160]   but they're still not coming to events like they're still not coming into your special talk or your bible
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.800]   study but there is more spiritual hunger so it's like how do we take advantage of that and i really
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.480]   like what you guys did and that might be part of the answer just like okay we got to do more on the
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.920]   spot like they have the questions let's answer right now instead of hoping to funnel them into some
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.160]   holding tank that we're yeah it's not just like attempt more but it's actually a fundamental
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.640]   different approach it's not bring them to a time where they can hear content it's like
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.960]   no you are the content and you go there and you go meet them because they're busy the window of
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.760]   opportunity is small and so you just gotta be ready right there yeah and if you just held a bunch of
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.720]   events you would never know that like you would never know people are more spiritually hungry because
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.440]   they're still not coming in any more numbers than they used to but like yeah you guys are seeing that on campus
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.720]   yeah and i think uh like a corollary that would be just to train more of our students too and invest a
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.280]   little bit more in that because they're where the students are you know so if they're equipped to
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:19.920]   answer those questions you know and things like that then um man that's that's gold i think right there
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.400]   you know and i think we've experienced that in a lot of ways even in our last semester at pomona where we
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.840]   try to do course 101 training you know to our students and then or evangelism training and then they just go and
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.920]   share the gospel with their friends and their friends become christian you know things like that
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:42.000]   and so we saw that kind of grow in a huge way too so yeah yeah yeah um i think one thing i would do
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.680]   differently is to do not is to have our staff and our students experience more ministries you know so
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:56.160]   while we've been here we've also been doing elderly care ministry so i have like a one-on-one bible study
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:02.480]   going on with like a really sharp elderly woman she's she's like she had a stroke and she's there
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.720]   but her mind is she's really sharp um the guys have been going to the dream center and that's been
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.240]   really like great for them yeah that's where you've been doing the computer training yeah yeah we go we've
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.000]   been going for their gospel nights oh you know and so um that's like once every term so once every six
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.680]   weeks or so dream center for those who don't know maybe just explain it um it's a it's a center where
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.880]   people who have been incarcerated kind of re-enter society and so they have housing and things like
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.840]   that it's sponsored by a church it's a ministry of a church and we come alongside them and provide
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:42.240]   a lot of the um skills and computer training that will help them to kind of um re-enter society
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.080]   because a lot of them have never yeah they've been in prison for like 30 40 years and they've never
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.160]   seen email or anything like that they have a hard time with a mouse um and so like a lot of our tech
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.680]   guys that's just something that we can kind of help them and show them what to do so yeah yeah so what
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.400]   what does um just to go back to close a loop like what does what do you think that people experiencing
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:09.280]   more ministries does yeah you know i haven't been able to like capture it in words um but i think
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:17.440]   what it's done from my heart is just kind of having like a a wider bigger picture of how god's at work
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:25.840]   and just having a deeper appreciation for the church too you know because we're in a very small church
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:32.080]   right and it's like mostly college and um and a little bit of youth and things like that but you know
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:39.440]   it's a very small kind of slice of reality right um but here you know we live with like richard and
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.960]   lauren kwan you know and so we have a window into like what happens at barnabas like all the things
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.240]   that she's doing like the way that she leads food you know they've been keeping up her and richard
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:56.560]   they've been keeping up with a japanese professor for years and they do a zoom bible study with him and
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:03.920]   just yeah i think what it does for me is just gives me a more of a sense of like
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:10.480]   well god is at work in all these different ways at our church and there's a lot that we can do there's
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:16.880]   a lot of work that needs to get done there's a lot of people that need the gospel and so something about
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:24.000]   that bigger perspective puts everything else in perspective you know so it's not yeah so if you're
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.160]   like really narrowly focused on just campus ministry and how that's going like it could start on the
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.760]   campus but if you narrowly focus on that your your mood your your convictions your spiritual fervor can
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.720]   really rise and fall just on what's happening in that world yeah world small and i think it's
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.760]   kind of like the way i see our staff it changes because yeah right now they're doing college
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:51.200]   ministry you know but you know i look at like our um a2k ministry for example man they are so awesome
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.560]   like they do so much for the kids like they we had this halloween thing and it was like our middle
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:04.080]   school kids and a2k they like it was amazing like the setup and thoughtfulness yeah you know and so i think
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:09.920]   just my perspective of like yeah how do we need to grow as kingdom workers it's not just a narrow set
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.440]   of like i'm doing college ministry and these are the things i need to be able to do as a college
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.240]   minister like it's like no no you're a minister and maybe right now you're doing college ministry
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.640]   but you know i want to like myself and everyone like we got to keep growing in all kinds of ways so
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.800]   that we can be kingdom workers in whatever context you know and so that picture of context is like way more
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.000]   rich for me after this year so yeah i mean it goes back to that what i said at the beginning of
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.120]   the podcast launching lifelong kingdom workers and so um not putting your identity in like the particular
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:49.360]   kind of ministry i'm doing but that i'm just a minister oh forever and to whoever god needs me to be
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.800]   and there's something very healthy about that yeah i think my experience of that because i love the fact
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.560]   that i am i have touch points at ecm and dream center and you know even helping out impact for a
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.920]   few weeks i think it gives me greater confidence in the gospel in the church because i look around and
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:12.560]   i'm like oh man when you're 75 or 80 years old you need the gospel when you're six year old yeah you need
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:18.880]   the gospel you know and i'm like oh there's so much need out there and so it just kind of elevates my own
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.280]   thinking of my my own life also you know and um gives me confidence in the fact that like what we
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:31.840]   need to do out there is really um something that people um really need you know um so nothing is in
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   vain you know and we just got to keep sewing out there yeah so so speaking of other ministries and
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.640]   things can you tell us a little bit about studio nova before we have to wrap up here like how's it been
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.800]   i don't know what's going on with studio yeah just what is it and why are we diving into it how's it
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:54.480]   been yeah yeah how's it going yeah well it started with you know a lot of i everyone saw the presentation
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.640]   but you know school is not just like about school anymore and there's a lot of different yeah um but
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.480]   also the other reality is you know our kids are not learning um as much as they could be learning and
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.720]   now it's very clear to us because kids took an assessment and now we know where they are and
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.200]   they're they're you know because we don't let them watch tv and they read all the time they're very
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:23.520]   very smart they're just under challenge they're under challenge so we are trying to test them
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.760]   and he was like 11th grade level yeah reading at the 11th grade level yeah yeah although we probably
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:35.200]   have to strike that from that because it's confidential but yeah it's okay um but yeah but we're um so
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:41.760]   student nova it's an accredited private school um and i'm really excited about all that they're gonna
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:50.160]   learn um i think i'm also excited about like all the ways that our our kids are gonna learn in outside
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.960]   of the curriculum so some of the things that we have planned because the curriculum part where they're
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   learning um and you know they're not like doing we're not the micro school yeah the micro school part
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.920]   they're doing their online learning lessons you know so so let me just it's a private school with
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.000]   an online curriculum and so the benefit is that a student will come and they'll take an assessment
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.800]   and then they'll have an education pathway that's kind of custom made for them kind of where they're at
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.240]   and like what gaps in knowledge or understanding that need to be filled and so it's a custom pattern that
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.720]   way and so in that way they're not hopefully they're not like super bored right as they're sitting in the
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.880]   classroom and so um that's one benefit you know and then um so they operate out of sac uh close by
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.520]   sacramento and we're going to start an alameda campus here um at hb um and so what where are we
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:49.680]   starting uh january like next month yeah oh wow right after um winter camp so we have about 20 24 25
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.080]   kids um who are going to start it's going to be a micro school so it's everyone from first and then we
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.280]   have a first grade through we have a few middle schoolers and so they're all in one classroom kind
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:07.520]   of doing their their coursework together on their separate computers um and but it's kind of a a community
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:14.400]   feel where the older younger one room yeah one room classroom yeah exactly and so um and then after
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.600]   they're done with the online curriculum then we'll have enrichment classes um and everything from
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:26.320]   foreign languages to 3d printing you know yeah so we have parents um lined up to teach different
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:33.760]   things not like take turns yeah so we're teaching korean we're teaching chinese um we're teaching piano
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.800]   but through these things called melodicas what you can look it up it's kind of a funny instrument where
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:45.760]   you have to blow into a tube to make sound yeah yeah um basic music theory and melodicas we have a chapel
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:52.000]   hour where they're going to gain more fluency in scripture there's fun stuff too like ping pong pe
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:01.760]   there's bibliopolis so it's like it's like online private like one room house like like like schoolhouse
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:08.400]   camp yeah all together the learning time is only like a couple hours three hours yeah so the afternoon
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.200]   time is what we're providing and how are the kids like are they excited about this like how are they
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.600]   oh really they're not like they're missing regular school they don't want to do this well right now
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:24.320]   they're excited okay yeah we hope they're gonna i think they're like willing participants yeah yeah yeah
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.600]   yeah actually that's one thing like if their child really doesn't want to do it like that's something we
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.840]   want to talk to the parents about it but we have not had situations like that actually we had the
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.560]   opposite where it was like we only want to do first through fifth and then these older kids are like
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:46.080]   wait a minute like we want to learn we're not learning we want to do it so yeah i had this
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:52.720]   and so you guys are like the headmistress and headmaster no no no emily kim oh emily kim is like
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:02.240]   superintendent principal yeah we kind of do all the logistical yeah work so yeah gosh gosh so then we're
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:07.680]   we're highlighting this yeah to see i guess the benefit of our network is to see if there's just better
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:15.440]   education for our kids as well as just other yeah yeah okay that's kind of neat never thought never
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   thought we'd be doing this i know we didn't know i mean it was like fit lit training but we're starting
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:29.840]   a school yeah that wasn't in the draft description i started a micro school i have one final thing before
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   we wrap up because i think we gotta end it kind of soon it's been a lot we covered but um tell us going back
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.760]   back to the fit lit program i just want to hear a little bit about how it's been in terms of
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.040]   your your group so you mentioned you're in cohorts right um there's 10 couples nine couples
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.360]   nine couples and it's very different from our experience so our experience six couples it was
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.480]   six couples and the youngest of us was 2013 and the oldest was 2010 so it's a four-year age gap
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.440]   what is it for you guys it's like it's like a decade right it's 2014 thanks for highlighting that
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:12.880]   yeah yeah but how's that been like interpersonally like what do you appreciate about the other guys
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   what what bugs you about them if you want like yeah just how's it been doing this with this kind of wild
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.640]   and crazy group you know like these guys josh and dj and yeah it's a lot of fun it's great it's so fun yeah
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.880]   i think this like intergenerational cohort of fitlets is it really has been a lot of fun i think
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.800]   we all bring a little bit of a different dynamic to the table but it all kind of works together and
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.960]   i think you know like uh you're talking about erts and i was like man there's such community creating
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.080]   power when we're all out there kind of doing this thing together you know and so that picture of all
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.640]   of us doing our little like special talks on our own um and just trying things we're like what are we
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:02.080]   supposed to do is this gonna work i don't know let's just go for it you know um yeah it just it it it
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:07.840]   really brings i think a lot of us it has brought a lot of us together um and even the day-to-day is a
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:14.240]   lot of fun so um we could be hanging from scaffolding 30 feet in the air in the cold you know or cooking
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:20.880]   breakfast at 6 a.m yeah um doesn't matter it as long as you know we have people that we enjoy being
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:26.240]   with and and have that community there then i feel like we can do uh that you know a lot of things are
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.360]   possible you know so yeah and it seems like you guys like have your system down for like erts like
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.120]   everyone kind of knows their role and like you don't even talk about it i heard like you just go on
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.880]   campus and it's like automatic completely in sync yeah yeah yeah after we've been doing these things
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.240]   for so many times until the newest idea comes and then we'll kind of figure things out you know but
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:55.440]   even that's a fun process yeah i think um the age it doesn't it i don't know that i think about it
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.600]   you know like there's like brian mount um dre they're like the youngest but there's things i learn you
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   know from them ben and helen they're like the fit lit parents you know they kind of like keep track
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:14.720]   of us and like know what's going on and stuff and um but i think it just i think one thing about
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:22.640]   experiencing it together the fit lit program is it just made me um value just our church so much more
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:28.400]   in some ways because it's like when you're all in you know you have a group of people that are all in
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.600]   and you have the same goals and the same vision and you want to do the same thing you experience
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   just such camaraderie you know and there's and then when there's like not you know ego in the room
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.680]   and like because you know we're all in the same room and it's like whether you're old or you're young
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:52.640]   like you know you're cooking breakfast yeah yeah you know it's like yeah so you're receiving truth you
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.360]   know like as it is and it's like but it's not a big deal you know because we're here to grow and learn
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:05.440]   and you know reach you know the world right so um in that way i think yeah kind of like in a concentrated
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:13.120]   way experience like just oneness and fellowship that i think yeah you can only have that i think in
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:19.120]   partnership with the gospel like true deep part with like years of history and shared values and
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.720]   all of that so yeah yeah what i'm hearing you say from that is just uh i mean i think something i
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.280]   experienced too infinite and since planning with a lot of the people that we are trained with you know
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.080]   like we planted philly together and now he's just said rutgers an hour away it's just appreciate
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:39.120]   like when so many ministers today it's just them you know and so many pastors are burning out because
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.720]   there's just like we actually get to do this with a lot of people and we get to do this in very close
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.320]   community and that's like that really is the thing that's gonna strengthen us for the like the long
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.720]   yeah i think i've been seeing that like we're just super lucky like no shade on other pastors i mean
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:00.000]   they're heroes like they yes yeah i'm i don't think i could do what they do on my own for sure but yeah
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.320]   the fact that we get to do it together it just makes it so much more just doable yeah it really um for me
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:12.960]   also um going back to your lifelong kingdom workers like this is um one of the benefits of it is being
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:20.320]   able to see someone when they were a freshman and then like like brian or calvin yeah and then working
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   alongside them now yeah you know uh it's such a neat kind of journey to be on with them you know it only
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:33.360]   comes through covenant relationship and and common commitment you know um but man what a what a what a
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.320]   what a precious experience it is to be able to do that with um people for this long would your younger
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:44.560]   self have ever believed that brian matt would be a fifth day today at this time so the first time brian
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:51.120]   came over to my house right he we we had dinner we cooked dinner and he had dinner and then um i was
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.920]   like all right guys like let's uh can can can you guys help clean up right and i was like brian can
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.000]   you do the dishes and then he goes from the dining table to the couch plops down on the couch and he
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:07.600]   goes i don't do dishes we'll leave it at that draw your own conclusions that's a good place to stop
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.040]   there that's a good place to stop there i always have vision for people so i'm not surprised but i'm
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.760]   you know i don't ever say nice things about him so i'm gonna say it right now on the record i'm
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.200]   i'm encouraged by him yeah no i was brian mouse leader for a year or two i was my first time
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.000]   leading staff so i don't know what i did i probably did a lot of ministry malpractice on him but praise
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.680]   the lord that's all i gotta say praise the lord well thank you guys for coming on i think that was like
