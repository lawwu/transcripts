[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.480]   Our next question comes from Kevin.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.000]   Kevin asks, how do you apply some of your ideas
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   to make sure your family can pursue a deeper life?
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   He elaborates that he is a director of engineering
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.640]   at a SAS company, but he also has a wife and three kids.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.360]   And he says, while I feel that my professional life is
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   amenable to productivity techniques and systems,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160]   I often struggle to feel in control of the day-to-day
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.520]   aspects of my family life.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.400]   I would love to hear more about any techniques and systems
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   you and your wife use to get your arms around all
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.520]   of the obligations and chores that come along with family
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   life, and how you free up more time to pursue a deep life
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.880]   together as a family.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.440]   Well, Kevin, it's a good question.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   I think the intersection of family life and deep life
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.600]   is something that a lot of people
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200]   are thinking about these days, especially
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.480]   on the other end of this pandemic and all the disruption
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.920]   that it created.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.680]   I will start by saying I'm not an expert on this topic.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.840]   I think organizing and making the most out of family life
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.600]   has unique challenges to it.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   So you can't just take ideas that
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.640]   might work in the world of work and directly port them over.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.760]   Trust me, I've tried to get my three-year-old to be
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.000]   a better time block planner, and his management of his Trello
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680]   boards is really quite horrendous.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.720]   He's not doing a good job of capturing task lists
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.120]   on the back of the digital card.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.800]   So it really just doesn't work.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.480]   I'm going to recommend a couple of books,
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.140]   and then I'll mention a couple of things
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.400]   that we do do in our family.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200]   And again, I can't say it's the best advice,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.040]   but some things we do.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.860]   But let me start with some books from people
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.560]   who know more about this.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.320]   One is Emily Oster's new book, The Family Firm.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.480]   Emily Oster is an economist at Brown.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.880]   She applies really interesting data-centric,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.960]   hyperlogical approaches to questions
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.120]   that take place in life outside of the world of work.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.920]   So obviously, for nerds like me or like you
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.680]   as a director of engineering at a SaaS company
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.580]   might appreciate this.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.280]   So The Family Firm is applying a data-driven approach
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.360]   to try to make lots of decisions about family life.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.120]   I haven't read it yet, but I like Oster,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.200]   and I'm sure it's a good book.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.040]   You might also want to check out the work of my friend Laura
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.120]   Vanderkam.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.760]   She's written quite a few books that are
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.400]   at least close to this area.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880]   Probably the book that is most in this area
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.960]   would be 168 Hours.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.160]   It's based off of a lot of interviews and time
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.280]   logs she did with people.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.320]   And she has some really interesting ideas in there
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.520]   about what to do with the time in your week.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.840]   One of the big headline ideas from that book
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   is basically to the extent that it is at all financially
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.120]   possible, basically outsource and automate
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.400]   as much of the more drudgery-focused household work
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.080]   that you can, that this is actually
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.540]   a really good strategy and something
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.720]   that we shouldn't think of as unusual or elite,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.220]   but actually should be at the core of it, especially if you
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.320]   have two working parents, what can we hire someone else to do
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.400]   that we don't actually care about doing ourselves?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.280]   So check out that book as well.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   Now, when it comes to what MyFamily actually does,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   there's a couple ideas I can think through that might be
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.960]   useful.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.560]   One thing we try to do is keep one weekend day clear.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.400]   So when we're working on activities for the kids,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.280]   we've been doing that this fall, for example,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.480]   and it's been quite successful, where we keep Saturdays clear
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720]   of any sort of I have to drive you
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.960]   to this place for this whatever sporting event.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.360]   Keep it clear of that.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.880]   Let those happen on Sunday.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.420]   And that's been really nice to have a completely open day,
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.040]   because then we can do whatever.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.300]   Let's go see the grandparents.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.440]   Let's go for a hike.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.920]   Let's go to a movie, whatever it is.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.460]   I think that's been a nice, relaxing trend
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.040]   that we've injected into our lives.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.240]   The other thing I'm real big on, and this is probably
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   a battle I'll end up losing at some point,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.120]   is really trying to keep activities minimized.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.080]   I think it's important that each of the kids
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.120]   always has something they're doing,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   especially at their ages, something physical,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.640]   because otherwise they will literally run up the walls
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   and be ripping drywall from the ceiling
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.040]   by the time we get to bedtime.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.160]   But one thing is enough.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.360]   It's really easy when you hear about these different
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.880]   activities, like, well, they would like that,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.100]   and this would be enriching for them.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.200]   Yeah, that would be kind of interesting,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.120]   and they should do that as well.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.080]   But the overhead of actually getting people
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.120]   to these places, driving the kids to the places,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.320]   waiting there, the fragmenting of your schedule.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.200]   Now that evening's gone.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.120]   Now this evening's gone.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.960]   Now we have something in the middle of the day this day.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160]   It's way, I think, underestimated the cost of that overhead.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.480]   So we've been trying to the extent possible to say,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.360]   well, why don't you play baseball this fall?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.520]   And that's good.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   And yeah, Boy Scouts might be fun.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.320]   That Robotics Club seems interesting.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.360]   And maybe there's this enrichment thing
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.200]   that your school's offering.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.500]   You know what, let's just not do any of those things.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.060]   And we're usually happy when we succeed
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.900]   with keeping that limit, because when you have enough kids,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.140]   one thing per kid takes up a lot of time already.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.340]   So those are some hacks that we deploy,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.460]   but check out those books.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.820]   Check out Oster's book.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.900]   Check out Vanderkem's books.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.500]   You'll get a lot more, let's say,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.900]   well-thought-through advice on this important question.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.480]   (upbeat music)
