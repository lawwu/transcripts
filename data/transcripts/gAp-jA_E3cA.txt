[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.520]   If you've listened to the podcast for a while,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.420]   you know we don't delve into social and legal
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.320]   and political issues on the podcast very often
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.500]   for a variety of reasons that we've explained over the years
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.820]   and that means attempts by APJ listeners
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.600]   to get us into that conversation
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.360]   and whether or not the church should legislate sin
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.880]   must get pretty creative and they do get creative,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.340]   even resorting to hypotheticals
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.600]   as in the case of today's question,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.920]   the most recent creative attempt
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640]   and it comes to us from an anonymous man,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.400]   a regular listener who writes this,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.060]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.420]   "I often wrestle with the question
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.760]   "over what role our government should play
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   "in outlawing sin.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.240]   "Specifically, I would like to ask you
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.800]   "a hypothetical question here.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.020]   "If you were an influential pastor theologian
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.340]   "back in 1913 America,
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.980]   "would you have supported Christian temperance organizations
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.600]   "and lent your voice to prohibition?"
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.960]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.440]   - I will try to answer this question honestly
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.960]   but I confess at the very beginning
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.520]   that this question leads into
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.840]   complex issues of church-state relations
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.360]   where I do not have as many answers
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.440]   as I would like to have.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.780]   But I will take you as far as I can
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.340]   and then you can go further.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.940]   The question whether I would have supported prohibition
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.360]   in 1913 might mean,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.820]   would you have supported it
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.380]   with all the cultural assumptions
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.700]   I may have shared as a child of my times in that day
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.660]   and without any of the hindsight that I now have,
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.100]   it might mean that,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.440]   or the question might mean,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.180]   given everything I know now,
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.920]   would I have supported prohibition
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280]   if I could get in a time machine and go back?
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.960]   Now, the answer to the first question is,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   I mean, nobody knows.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   You don't know who you are.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.680]   What would you be like?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.540]   It would have been relatively easy
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.520]   to see that a world without drunkenness
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.220]   would be a vastly better world
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.660]   than the one we live in
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.180]   or the one they lived in in 1913.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.920]   And I can imagine myself being persuaded
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   that the benefits of sobriety in families and workplaces
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.780]   would justify taking away some legitimate pleasures
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.940]   that both the Bible and culture would ordinarily allow.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.580]   This is the sort of limitation
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.960]   on people's pleasures and freedoms that we have embraced.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.120]   With regard to smoking, for example,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.420]   when I was a boy,
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.060]   it would have been absolutely unthinkable
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500]   to tell a person that he could not smoke in an airplane
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.220]   or in the office where they work or in a restaurant.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.180]   Unthinkable.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.500]   Rebellion everywhere.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.420]   Mandates, mandates.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.100]   But little by little,
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.740]   society as a whole has become so persuaded
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.480]   that smoking is dangerous to our health
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.760]   and so unpleasant to most people
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.580]   that we are willing for governments, goodnight,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.320]   and institutions to mandate the prohibition of smoking
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.200]   in most workplaces and restaurants
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.100]   and theaters, transportation.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.480]   Now, I like these limitations.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah, me too.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.600]   I like them so much,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   it's easy for me to imagine supporting something
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.820]   like prohibition for similar reasons.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.820]   So I don't know what I would have done in 1913,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.380]   but if the question means,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.460]   given everything I know now,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.600]   would I have supported prohibition
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.340]   if a time machine could take me back?
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.600]   And the answer is no, I wouldn't.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   First, because the Bible does not require teetotalism.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.800]   It prohibits drunkenness.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.720]   It warns about the dangers of alcohol.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.840]   In the end, it bites like a serpent
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.820]   and stings like an adder.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.660]   Your eyes will see strange things
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.760]   and your heart utter perverse things.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.240]   like one who lies on the top of a mast.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.160]   That's a great picture.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   Proverbs 23, 32.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.400]   But there's no prohibition in the Bible.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.640]   I think a very strong case can be made
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.800]   for total abstinence in our world
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   as a matter of wisdom for oneself,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.280]   but not as a requirement for others,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.560]   except maybe in some institutional,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.120]   limited institutional expectations.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.880]   This is mainly a matter of conscience.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.240]   But second reason I would not get in my time machine
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.180]   and go back and vote for prohibition
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.240]   is that it didn't work.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.720]   It had unintended consequences
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.260]   that may have been as destructive
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.920]   as the previous abuse of alcohol itself.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   And this is because unlike the limitations on smoking
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.040]   in our day, the long-term societal support
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.940]   was simply not there.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.120]   It seemed like it was there because good night,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.680]   it takes a lot of people to get a amendment
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.840]   to the constitution passed in 1919.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   But by 1933, the adequate support had disintegrated
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.600]   and it was reversed.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.340]   Now, here's where the issues are raised
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.240]   like the one our friend asked in his question,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   what role should our government play in outlawing sin?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.280]   That's part of his question.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   That's where it's all leading,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.500]   which gets us into the weeds here.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.720]   I think a more precise way to ask the question
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   is how does the state decide
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.760]   what actions should be outlawed
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.000]   which Christians regard as sin?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   And you'll see in a minute why
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.560]   I think that's a better question.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.920]   So here are my guidelines.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.440]   I got, I don't know what I got here.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.700]   Four, I think four guidelines for wrestling
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.980]   with the question about the relationship
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.300]   between the revealed will of Christ in scripture
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.740]   and the lawmaking power of the state
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.840]   enforceable with the sword.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.540]   Number one, the church today, the people of Christ
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.940]   on this side of the cross, unlike Israel
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.940]   in the old Testament are not a geopolitical entity.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.820]   The church is not a nation state.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.400]   Therefore the old Testament legal stipulations
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.700]   with their punishments like capital punishment
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.020]   for idolatry or cursing one's parents
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.940]   are not simply brought over and implemented in the church.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.360]   The church excommunicates unrepentant idolaters.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.740]   It doesn't execute them.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   Second, this does not mean that those sins
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   are less grievous or less worthy of capital punishment.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.600]   It means that the church hands over that judgment
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.400]   to Christ at his coming.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   There will be a perfect reckoning
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.420]   from the judge of the universe.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.940]   Christ will settle all accounts.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.940]   That ultimate reckoning is not the job of church leaders.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.520]   Third, Christian faith and all the heart obedience of faith,
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:18.200]   which flows from it, cannot be coerced by the sword
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300]   that is by the state.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.260]   The entire history of Christendom by force
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.920]   from Constantine to the Puritans was misguided.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.940]   Any arrangement of church state relations
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.940]   that sanctions state penalties to promote true heart faith
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.780]   and the heart obedience of faith
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.840]   will eventually corrupt the church.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:51.160]   Fourth and finally, Jesus said in John 18, 36,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.960]   "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.960]   my servants would have been fighting
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.700]   that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.220]   but my kingdom is not of this world."
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.060]   Now, the inference I draw from that statement
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.180]   and other aspects of the New Testament
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.180]   is that Christ in this age does not sanction
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.960]   the use of the sword to punish those who disobey him.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.940]   Or to say it another way,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.100]   Christ does not sanction the use of the sword
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.840]   to enforce disobedience to him.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.500]   This means that the state to whom God has given the sword,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.420]   according to Romans 13,
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.420]   should not seek to compel obedience to Christ.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.720]   Now listen carefully,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.240]   because I'm gonna make some distinctions here
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.100]   that are fine.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.460]   I'll leave a lot of questions unanswered,
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.680]   but I think these distinctions really help.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.080]   Obeying a law that Christ would approve
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.820]   is not the same as obeying Christ.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.820]   And disobeying a law that Christ would approve
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.700]   is not the same as disobeying Christ.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.780]   A person who doesn't even believe that Christ existed
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.420]   can obey a law that Christ approves.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.760]   Therefore, punishment for disobeying a law
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.840]   that Christ approves is not the same
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.500]   as punishment for disobeying Christ.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.800]   I don't think the state should ever punish a person
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   for disobeying Christ.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.260]   I think that is the prerogative of church discipline.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.800]   And I think the most severe form of church discipline
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.040]   is excommunication, not death.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.120]   There is a difference between saying that Christ wills
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.880]   that a person be punished by the state
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.720]   for breaking a law Christ approves
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.840]   and saying that Christ wills that a person be punished
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.660]   by the state for disobeying him.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.300]   The former is right, the latter is wrong.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.300]   Christ does will that a person be punished by the state
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.280]   for breaking a law that he approves.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.040]   But Christ does not will that a person be punished
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.920]   by the state for disobeying Christ.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   All of which implies that Christians should consult Christ
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   in his word when thinking through what sins
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.320]   should be prohibited by law.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   Because the use of the sword
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   to enforce Christ-approved laws is not the same
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   as using the sword to enforce obedience to Christ.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   - That is complex.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.920]   - They'll have to hit replay.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.640]   - Amen, rewind and replay.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   Even better, read the full transcript of the episode.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.520]   I guess this is as good an opportunity as any
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.840]   to remind everyone out there that as you listen
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.520]   to this episode, this podcast is transcribed in its entirety
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.400]   and published at our online home at askpastorjohn.com.

[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.680]   It's all there, askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.340]   While some Christians are dramatically saved
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.040]   out of a life of scandalous sin
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.620]   and have an amazing testimony of deliverance to share,
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.480]   other Christians, particularly those saved at a young age,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.240]   don't have such a dramatic conversion story.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.500]   Should Christians with less dramatic testimonies
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.960]   be okay with that?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.240]   That's next time.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.120]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, we will see you back here
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   on Monday, have a great weekend.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
