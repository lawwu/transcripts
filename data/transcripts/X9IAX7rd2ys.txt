[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   As we read, we are generating very low levels
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.040]   of motor activity in our throat.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.480]   That is, we are speaking the words that we are reading
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.000]   at a level below the perception of sound
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   or our own perception of those words.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.040]   But if one were to put an amplifier
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.320]   to measure the firing of those muscles in our vocal cords,
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.340]   we'd find that as we're reading information,
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.440]   we are actually speaking that information.
