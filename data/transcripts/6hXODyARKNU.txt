[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   uh, interview between Joe Rogan and the rock Dwayne, the rock Johnson, the rock is an interesting
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   character. So this interview caught my attention. Um, one of the reasons why I'm interested in the
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.200]   rock and Jesse, you just probably won't surprise you is that, um, I'm often confused for the rock,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   right? Like this happens a lot. Like people will be like, oh yeah. Um, I saw you interviewed on
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.080]   the rocks podcast. They're like, no, no, no, no, no. I was on a Cal Newport show. Yeah. And it's
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.080]   just, you know, it's a physical stature thing. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he's probably been your,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.760]   uh, garage gym. Yeah. You know, like people will come by and be like, oh, cool, man. Like
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.560]   the new ports have the rock working out in the garage gym. No, no, no, it's me. It's Cal like,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.240]   oh, we were thrown because of the similarities in your physical workout. My Hemsworth also is,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.200]   I'm interested in Chris Hemsworth because all, you know, this happens a lot. Like I'll be picking
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.640]   my kids up from school and people be like, Thor, like, no, no, no, that's, that's Chris Hemsworth.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.440]   Anyways. So I was listening to, um, this interview with, with Joe Rogan and the rock,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.760]   and they had a discussion early on that I wanted to bring up. All right. So early on,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.280]   they were talking about the importance of having some sort of passion that you pursue.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   And this was in the context of a discussion of, you know, some people have it hard
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.800]   and you're kind of grinding day to day. And they're saying like, in this situation,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.440]   you'd need something you're going after something you're getting after that. You have this passion
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.280]   that you're pursuing, that you can focus your energy on. Otherwise you just get stuck with
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   you're on social media all day. You're eating crap. You're drinking all the time. It's the,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.520]   having some sort of passion to pursue. They were, they were presenting this in the context of life,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.920]   not just in the context of work as a necessary component to sort of avoiding all the traps.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.560]   That can really trap a lot of people these days into a life of resentment or disappointment.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.120]   So I wanted to tackle this a little bit, right? Because you could see this idea as maybe
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   contradicting my book. So good. They can't ignore you, which was arguing against the common Maxim.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   Follow your passion. So let's, let's put these two next to each other. So good. They can't ignore you.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.400]   And the idea as spoken by my doppelganger, doing the rock Johnson, that passion is the key
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   to actually escaping a shallow life. Well, here's the thing I believe after listening
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.120]   to this interview, and I want to clarify this, we're highly aligned on this because what the
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.560]   rock and Joe Rogan were talking about, what they did not say, if you listen to this interview,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.240]   what they did not say was right now, I want you to think really hard today and figure out your
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   one true passion and then go after it. That's not what they said. What the rock was saying instead
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.360]   is you need to have that. The pursuit of something you're passionate about is going to free you,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.040]   but he did not say where that pursuit actually came from. He did not say that you identify that
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   passion easily. And from the very beginning, and we know that in part, because we can look at the
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.600]   life of Dwayne Johnson himself, and he gets into this in this interview, the haphazardness,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.000]   or should we say the randomness with which the early stages of his path to where he is today
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   actually unfolded. When he talked about football, that was going to be his thing. Not everyone
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.920]   knows this about Dwayne Johnson, but he was a relatively successful college football player.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   He's a big guy, but he knew at some point he realized that wasn't going to be his ticket.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   He wasn't quite good enough. And when you play at the high level, you get that sense. He didn't have
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.720]   what it would take to succeed at the NFL level, so then he gets into wrestling. But this for a while
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   is really not a great situation. He talked about wrestling at bars and selling his headshot for
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.840]   $5 a piece just to make enough money that he could buy a sandwich. It was a random unfolding of
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.120]   things that got him to eventually a point where he pursues his life with a lot of passion.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.720]   So he didn't identify a passion in advance, but lives his life with a lot of passion.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.800]   So what lesson do we extrapolate that from for the rest of us? Well, the idea that I uncover
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.280]   in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, is that passion is something that you cultivate,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.320]   not something that you discover. Passion is not, I do some reflection and I figure out this is what
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.200]   I'm passionate about. It's something you cultivate. And how do you cultivate it? Well, you cultivate
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   it with discipline. You cultivate it with curiosity. It's a combination of those two things.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.360]   You're curious, you're engaged in the world and options and what's possible. Through this
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   curiosity, you find something like this could be interesting. Let me pursue it with discipline.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.800]   And through the discipline pursuit is where you learn, is this thing building momentum or is it
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.920]   a dead end? Curiosity plus discipline. And when something starts to click, you up the discipline,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.880]   you up the intensity. And over time that blossoms into passion. And so we see this in the Rock's
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.040]   path. He goes from football into wrestling, the wrestling is not going well. He makes some
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.480]   changes, gets involved with WWE and suddenly things are really starting to click. And he
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   gives that full intense discipline, really develops his body, develops himself as someone
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.560]   able to play characters. And he begins to pursue his life with this particular goal with a real
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.960]   passion. That passion then is what carried him from that and the movies and all the other things
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   he's involved with today. That was a passion that was cultivated from discipline and curiosity.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   That I think is the lesson probably if we sat them down here. If we got Joe and The Rock,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.040]   I don't know if they'd accept an invitation, but we should send it out. Hey, Joe and The Rock,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.080]   come on by the Deep Work HQ. Come on into the studio. We'll talk to you. I think they would
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.000]   agree with this. And certainly I think Dwayne Johnson would probably agree with this.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   Yeah, it's not about I know in advance what I'm supposed to do. It's about approaching the things
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.560]   that you think might be worth doing with enough discipline that you have the opportunity for that
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:16.080]   to cultivate and blossom into passion. If that's a possibility. We discover and develop passion
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   over time. We don't find it through a short moment of self-reflection. So I really like this idea
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.120]   that the discipline, passion, pursuit of things is critical for the deep life. But nuancing that
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.720]   with you don't get there by starting with the passion. You actually start with the discipline
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.800]   and the curiosity. And if you're doing that right, the passion will come later.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.360]   I'm not done with that interview yet. Yeah, I'm going to check it out.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.480]   I started listening to it yesterday while I was exercising. And that caught my attention.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   I don't know what happens later in the interview.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   When he talked about Rogan and the raw coming to the HQ for guests, it reminded me of how
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.920]   Mad Dog always talks about, I mean, he gets a lot of guests, but he puts in calls like Kyle Shan and
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.400]   Dave Campbell, like some big time NFL coaches. He just calls us to see?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   Well, I mean, he has his guys do it, but a lot of them just say no. I mean, he's got a lot of
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   good guests on, but he always makes jokes about how, "Yeah, yeah, we got the call into Kyle."
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.520]   Got the call. I bet we would get a 10% of the big time. If we regularly invited big time guests,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.480]   I think we'd be surprised. I think like 10% of the people we invited might come,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.800]   but we just don't ask because we don't do a lot of interviews. I don't think The Rock would come,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   but you never know. That's like the weird thing about it. You never know like, oh, this particular
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:42.160]   celebrity turns out to secretly be a fan. I forgot about this, my agent, because we were doing
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.840]   publicity stuff for the new book. I forgot about this, but it turns out like Michelle Pfeiffer
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   is a fan of Deep Work. Oh, really?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   It's like a random thing. She posted a photo of it years ago or something I'd forgotten about it. So
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   you never know. So like Michelle Pfeiffer likes Deep Work. We know Rory McIlroy, McIlroy, whatever
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.800]   his name is. He's a big digital minimalism guy, right? The golfer. He plays the golfs. So you
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.120]   never know. So we could have Michelle and Rory. Yep. Yep. They can both come on the show. I was
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.960]   thinking we should invite Schwarzenegger because he has the book out. Yeah. I bet we have like a
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.800]   20% chance he would come. Plus I think he's kind of bored. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   I mean, he did Ryan's show. He's been a lot. He's been a lot of shit. He's on Ferris again. I read
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.120]   his book the other day. Yeah. How was it? I mean, it was fine. I would recommend his
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.640]   autobiography. Yeah, I've read that. Yeah. His autobiography, you're going to get the same. I
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.160]   mean, it's longer, but it's way more. I think you're going to get the same lessons and it's
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.320]   like a better book. But wait, if we're going to invite him, I shouldn't say that. I loved his new
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.240]   book. Let's get him on. Let's get him on the show. Oh, well, in the meantime, he smokes stogies.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.560]   He smokes stogies. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. What's Zoe going to think? And we have
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.360]   Arnold in here smoking stogies. We probably have to go outside. But you know what? The
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.280]   Chinese healer across the hall does those weird oils that like they have a pretty distinct smell
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.840]   at the whole floor. Sounds like so why can't we have Arnold Schwarzenegger smoking stogies on our
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.640]   HQ? Zoe's are the super people are wondering for the building. All right. That's going to be our
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.400]   thing. Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well. Check it out.
