[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.280]   Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.040]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.440]   And I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.640]   as we encourage one another, learn together, and ponder
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.200]   the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.360]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.400]   Whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.560]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.200]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.800]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.560]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.400]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.840]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to be with you again today
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.960]   for another episode of our Summer Book Club series.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640]   I have been thinking about how much I love to read as a grown
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.480]   up and how much I love to read as a child.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.520]   For childhood me, reading was a pleasure, a pure pleasure,
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.280]   almost a passion when I found books
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.800]   that really captured my mind.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.280]   I could easily lose myself in a book
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.160]   and disappear for an entire afternoon or even most
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.600]   of the day in the summertime.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.560]   I was often transformed by the books that I was reading.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.280]   I became a prairie girl who only got one peppermint stick
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.720]   and a penny for Christmas.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.400]   I swam with the dolphins.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.240]   I joined a wagon train headed west.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.720]   I solved mysteries as an amateur sleuth.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680]   And along the way, in all of these books that I read,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960]   I learned a million odd bits of information,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   stuff I never intended to learn, stuff I didn't even
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.800]   know I was learning.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.400]   I picked up all sorts of insights
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.440]   on odd foreign culture and historical references
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   and weird color names and so, so many vocabulary words.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.560]   I was growing rich without knowing it.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.720]   And that's what reading does.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.600]   It transforms us while we're not looking.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.240]   That's why it's really important to be careful what you read.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.640]   It gets in your mind.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.320]   It changes you.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.880]   So this summer, I'm encouraging you to read with your children.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.600]   See what's going in their minds and what's
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.720]   going on in their minds.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.240]   Take in good stories and inspiring biographies
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.360]   and interesting tidbits from travel books and science books
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.120]   and hobby manuals and talk about what you read
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.240]   and how it makes you feel and what you've learned
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.840]   and what you think about it all.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.640]   Reading is a gateway to growth.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   So this summer, go and grow together as a family.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.600]   It's the best gift you'll ever give yourselves.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.360]   Today, I want to read three selections, three short stories,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.880]   chapters for you from our Copper Lodge Library,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.080]   This is a great read aloud.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.520]   It's good for morning basket time or family read alouds
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.680]   whenever you do it.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.080]   And the subjects in Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.320]   you will find this fall to be a really great companion to what
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.000]   you're learning in our Foundations Essentials program.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.440]   But today, I'm going to read you three stories.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.040]   And then I'm going to give you some conversation starters,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.560]   some questions that you could use as jumping off points
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.960]   from your reading that might lead you
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.320]   on another voyage of discovery with your children.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.280]   So you guys sit back and listen and get
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.040]   ready for The Kettle from Exploring Insects
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   with Uncle Paul.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   Now, this day, Mother Ambrosine was very tired.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.720]   She had taken down from their shelves
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.920]   kettles, saucepans, lamps, candlesticks, casseroles, pans,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   and lids.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.480]   After having rubbed them with fine sand and ashes
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.360]   and washed them well, she had put the utensils in the sun
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.440]   to dry them thoroughly.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.720]   They all shone like a mirror.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   The kettles particularly were superb
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.120]   with their rosy reflections.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.600]   One might have said that tongues of fire
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.240]   were shining inside them.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.760]   The candlesticks were a dazzling yellow.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.880]   Emile and Jules were lost in admiration.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.560]   "I should like to know what they make kettles of.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.960]   They shine so," remarked Emile.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.240]   "They are very ugly outside, all black and daubed with soot.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.080]   But inside, how beautiful they are."
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.760]   "You must ask Uncle," replied his brother.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.680]   "Yes," assented Emile.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.840]   No sooner said than done, they went in search of their uncle.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.880]   He did not have to be entreated.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.520]   He was happy whenever there was an opportunity
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.040]   to teach them something.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.680]   "Kettles are made of copper," he began.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.320]   "And copper?"
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.080]   asked Jules.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.520]   "Copper is not made.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.600]   In certain countries, it is found already made,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   mixed with stone.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.040]   It is one of the substances that is not
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.760]   in the power of man to make.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.840]   We use these substances as God has deposited them
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.760]   in the bosom of the earth for purposes of human industry.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.320]   But all our knowledge and all our skill
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.760]   could not produce them.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.240]   In the bosom of mountains where copper is found,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.600]   they hollow out galleries which go deep into the earth.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   There, workmen called miners, with lamps to light them,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.280]   attack the rock with great blows of the pick,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.440]   while others carry the detached blocks outside.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:41.160]   These blocks of stone in which copper is found are called ore.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   In furnaces made for the purpose,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.600]   they heat the ore to a very high temperature.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   The heat of our stove, when it's red hot,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.760]   is nothing in comparison.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.960]   The copper melts, runs, and is separated from the rest.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.360]   Then, with hammers of enormous weight,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.960]   set in motion by a wheel turned by water,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.480]   they strike the mass of copper, which, little by little,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.560]   becomes thin and is hollowed into a large basin.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.320]   The coppersmith continues the work.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.360]   He takes the shapeless basin and, with little strokes
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.960]   of the hammer, fashions it on the anvil
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.040]   to give it a regular shape.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.920]   That is why coppersmiths tap all day with their hammers,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.440]   commented Jules.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.560]   I had often wondered, when passing their shops,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.320]   why they made so much noise, always tap, tap,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.600]   tapping without any stop.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   They were thinning the copper, shaping it
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.680]   into saucepans and kettles.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.880]   Here, Emile asked, when a kettle is old, has holes in it,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.320]   and can't be used, what do they do with it?
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.840]   I heard Mother Ambrosine speak of selling a worn-out kettle.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.320]   It is melted, and another new kettle made out of the copper,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.640]   replied Uncle Paul.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.400]   Then the copper does not wear away.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.360]   Well, it wears away too much, my friend.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.480]   Some of it is lost when they rub it with sand to make it shine.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.680]   Some is lost, too, by the continual action of the fire.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.960]   But what is left is still good.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.000]   Mother Ambrosine also spoke of recasting
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.600]   a lamp, which had lost a foot.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.800]   What are lamps made of?
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.080]   They are of tin, another substance
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.000]   that we find ready-made in the bosom of the earth,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   without the power of producing it ourselves.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.840]   And I'll continue reading the next chapter, Metals.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.680]   Copper and tin are called metals, continued Uncle Paul.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.520]   They are heavy, shining substances,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.840]   which bear the blows of the hammer without breaking.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   They flatten, but do not break.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   There are still other substances which
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.600]   possess the considerable weight of copper and tin,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.000]   as well as their brilliancy and resistance to blows.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.880]   All of these substances are called metals.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:52.240]   Then lead, which is so heavy, is a metal, too, asked Emil.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.440]   Iron also, silver, and gold, queried his brother.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.680]   Yes, these substances and still others are metals.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.720]   All have a peculiar brilliancy called metallic luster.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.880]   But the color varies.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:20.760]   Copper is red, gold, yellow, silver, iron, lead, tin,
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.800]   white, with a very slightly different shade
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.840]   from one another.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.680]   The candlesticks Mother Ambrosine is drying in the sun,
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.720]   said Emil, are a magnificent yellow,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.120]   and so shiny they dazzle.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.800]   Are they gold?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.720]   No, my dear child.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.440]   Your uncle does not possess such riches.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.760]   They are brass.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.040]   To vary the colors and other properties of the metals,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   instead of always using them separately,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.360]   they often mix two or three together, or even more.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.680]   They melt them together, and the whole
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.400]   constitutes a sort of new metal, different from those which
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.480]   enter into its composition.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.280]   Thus, in melting together copper and a kind of white metal
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.600]   called zinc, the same as the garden watering pots
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.560]   are made of, they obtain brass, which
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.320]   has not the red of copper, nor the white of zinc,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   but the yellow of gold.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.200]   The material of the candlesticks is, then,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.280]   made of copper and zinc together.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   In a word, it is brass and not gold,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.600]   in spite of its luster and yellow color.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:57.760]   Gold is yellow and glitters, but all that is yellow and glitters
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   is not gold.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   At the last village fair, they sold
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.680]   magnificent rings whose brilliancy deceived you.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.080]   In gold, they would have cost a fine sum.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.320]   The merchants sold them for a sue.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.480]   They were brass.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.720]   How can they tell gold from brass,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.280]   since the color and luster are almost the same, asked Jules.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.600]   By the weight, chiefly, gold is much heavier than brass.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.640]   It is, indeed, the heaviest metal in frequent use.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:45.440]   After it comes lead, then silver, copper, iron, tan,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.600]   and, finally, zinc, the lightest of all.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.440]   You told us that to melt copper, put in Emil,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.960]   they needed a fire so intense that the heat of a red-hot
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.480]   stove would be nothing in comparison.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.280]   All metals do not resist like that,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.920]   for I remember very well in what a sorry way
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.280]   the first leaden soldiers you gave me came to their end.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.080]   Last winter, I had lined them up on the lukewarm stove
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   just when I was not watching the troop tottered, sank down,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.360]   and ran in little streams of melted lead.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.680]   I had only time to save half a dozen grenadiers,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.680]   and their feet were missing.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.720]   And when Mother Amberzine thoughtlessly
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.960]   put the lamp on the stove, added Jules, oh, it was soon done for.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.400]   A finger's breadth of tin had disappeared.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.280]   Tin and lead melt very easily, explained Uncle Paul.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   The heat of our hearth is enough to make them run.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.040]   Zinc also melts without much trouble,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.160]   but silver, then copper, then gold, and, finally, iron
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.400]   need fires of an intensity unknown in our houses.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.240]   Iron, above all, has excessive resistance,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.120]   very valuable to us.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.040]   Shovels, tongs, grates, stoves are iron.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.360]   These various objects, always in contact with the fire,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   do not melt. However, they do not even soften.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.000]   To soften iron so as to shape it easily on the anvil
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.120]   by blows from the hammer, the smith
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.840]   needs all the heat of his forge.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.000]   In vain would he blow and put on coal.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   He would never succeed in melting it.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.920]   Iron, however, can be melted, but you
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:07.080]   must use the most intense heat that human skill can produce.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:14.720]   And now, Week 10's reading, Gold and Iron.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:23.200]   Some metals never rust.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.080]   Such a one is gold.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.920]   Ancient gold pieces found in the earth after centuries
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.000]   are as bright as the day they were coined.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.560]   No dross, no rust covers their effigy and inscription.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:50.960]   Time, fire, humidity, air cannot harm this admirable metal.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.760]   Therefore, gold, on account of its unchangeable luster
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.720]   and its rarity, is preeminently the material
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.040]   for ornaments and coins.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.760]   Furthermore, gold is the first metal
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.000]   that man became acquainted with long before iron, lead, tin,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.320]   and the others.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.880]   The reason why man's attention was called to gold
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.640]   long centuries before iron is not hard to understand.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.240]   Gold never rusts.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.880]   Iron rusts with such grievous facility
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.480]   that in a short time, if we're not careful,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.560]   it's converted into red earth.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.200]   I've just told you that gold objects, however old they may
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.280]   be, have come to us intact, even after being
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.200]   in the dampest ground.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.920]   As for objects of iron, not one has reached us
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.680]   that was not in an unrecognizable state.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.520]   Corroded with rust, they become a shapeless, earthy crust.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.280]   Now, I will ask Jules if the iron ore that
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.840]   is extracted from the bowels of the earth
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:23.240]   can be real, pure iron, such as we use.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.800]   Hmm.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.480]   It seems to me not, uncle.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.760]   But if iron, at any given moment, is pure,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.880]   it must rust with time and change to earthy matter,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.800]   as does the blade of a knife buried in the ground.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.440]   My brother seems to reckon correctly.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.200]   I agree with him, said Claire.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.680]   And gold?
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.720]   Uncle Paul asked her.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.480]   It is different with gold, she replied,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:02.520]   as that metal never rusts, is not changed by time, air,
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.280]   and dampness.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.800]   It must be pure.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.680]   Exactly so.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.440]   In the rocks, where it is disseminated in small scales,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:20.040]   gold is as brilliant as in jewelers' boxes.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   Claire's earrings have not more luster
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.120]   than the particles set by nature in the rock.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.480]   On the contrary, what a pitiful appearance
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   iron makes when it is found.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   It's an earthy crust, a reddish stone
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   in which, only after long research,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.280]   can one suspect the presence of a metal.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:51.280]   It is, in fact, rust, mixed more or less with other substances.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.800]   And then, it is not enough to perceive that this rusty stone
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.880]   contains a metal.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.960]   A way must still be found to decompose the ore
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.880]   and bring the iron back to its metallic state.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.000]   How many efforts were necessary to attain this result?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.840]   One of the most difficult to achieve.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.080]   How many fruitless attempts?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.560]   How many painful trials?
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.200]   Iron, then, was the last to become of use to us.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.880]   Long after gold and other metals,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   like copper and silver, which are sometimes, but not always,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.000]   found pure, that most useful of metals was the last.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.760]   But with it, an immense advance was made in human industry.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.160]   From the moment man was in possession of iron,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.720]   he found himself master of the earth.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.160]   At the head of substances that resist shock,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.520]   iron must be placed.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.680]   And it is precisely its enormous resistance
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.640]   to rupture that makes this metal so precious to us.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.880]   Never would a gold, copper, marble, or stone anvil
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:22.520]   resist the blows of the smith's hammer as an iron one does.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.960]   The hammer itself, of what substance other than iron,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.840]   could it be made?
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.280]   If a copper, silver, or gold, it would flatten, crush,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.520]   and become useless in a short time,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.920]   for those metals lack hardness.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.560]   If of stone, it would break at the first rather hard blow.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.640]   For these implements, nothing can take the place of iron,
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   nor can it for axes, saws, knives, the mason's chisel,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.000]   the quarry man's pick, the plowshare,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   and a number of other implements which cut, hew, pierce, plane,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.760]   file, give, or receive violent blows.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:19.080]   Iron alone has the hardness that can cut most other substances.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.640]   And the resistance that sets blows at defiance.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.720]   In this respect, iron is, of all mineral substances,
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   the handsomest present that providence has given to man.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.520]   It is preeminently the material for tools,
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.440]   indispensable in every art and industry.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.480]   Claire and I read one day, said Jules,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.360]   that when the Spaniards discovered America,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.960]   the men of that new country had gold axes,
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.360]   which they very willingly exchanged for iron ones.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.520]   I laugh at their innocence, which
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.720]   made them give such a costly price
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.880]   for a piece of very common metal.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.920]   I think I see now that the exchange was to their advantage.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.800]   Yes, decidedly to their advantage.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.560]   For with an iron axe, they could fell trees
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.240]   to make their dugout canoes and their huts.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.480]   They could better defend themselves
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.440]   against wild animals and attack the game in their hunts.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   This piece of iron gave them an assurance of food,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.440]   a substantial boat, a warm dwelling, a redoubtable weapon.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:53.600]   In comparison, a gold axe was only a useless plaything.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   Well, if iron came last, what did men do before they
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.480]   knew of it, asked Jules.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.920]   They made their weapons and tools of copper.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.160]   For like gold, this metal is sometimes in a pure state
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.600]   so that it can be utilized just as nature gives it to us.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   But a copper implement having little hardness
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.120]   is of much less value than an iron one.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.880]   Thus, in those far-off days of copper axes,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.680]   man was indeed a wretched creature.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.400]   He was still more so before knowing copper.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.080]   He cut a flint to a point or split it and fashioned it
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.480]   to the end of a stick.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.520]   That was his only weapon.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.320]   With this stone, he had to procure food, clothing, a hut,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.280]   and to defend himself from wild beasts.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.560]   His clothing was a skin thrown over his back,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.520]   his dwelling a hut, a hut made of twisted branches
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:09.200]   and mud, his food a piece of flesh, produce of the chase.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.640]   Domestic animals were unknown, the earth uncultivated,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.600]   all industry lacking.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.080]   And where was that, asked Clare.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   Everywhere, my dear child.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.120]   Here, even in places where today are our most flourishing towns.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.840]   Oh, how forlorn man was before attaining,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   by the help of iron, the well-being that we enjoy today.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.360]   How forlorn was man and what a great present Providence
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.440]   gave him in giving him this metal.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.360]   Just as Uncle Paul finished, Jacques
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.080]   knocked discreetly at the door.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.200]   Jewels ran to open it.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.920]   They whispered a few words to each other.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.000]   It was at about an important affair for the next day.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.080]   I hope that you enjoyed those three short stories
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.880]   from the Copper Lodge Library edition of Exploring Insects
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.280]   with Uncle Paul.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.880]   But you know, the best part of reading, to me,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   is that it doesn't have to end when you finish the story.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.560]   You can talk about it.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:40.160]   You can prime the conversational pump and keep the story going.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.760]   After you read these stories, you might say, and look around,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.640]   what do you have at home that's made out of copper?
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.120]   Go through your cabinets.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.360]   Go through your kitchen cabinets.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.640]   Look at the decorations in your home.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.840]   What do you have that's made out of copper?
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.240]   What do you have that's made out of gold?
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.440]   Do you have anything made out of brass?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.040]   Can you compare it with something made out of gold?
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.600]   Is one heavier than the other?
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.440]   Do you have anything made out of silver?
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.480]   And then talk with your kids.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.880]   Where did these things come from?
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.200]   Are they heirlooms that you got from your parents
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.960]   or from grandma and grandpa?
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.320]   Did you buy them at the store?
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.000]   Did you find them at the antique store?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.200]   Did you make any of them yourselves?
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.800]   What are the characteristics of those metal objects?
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.480]   Which ones of them get dull?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.800]   Do any of them get rusty?
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.160]   What is tarnish?
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.920]   And what does it look like?
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.480]   And how do you get rid of it?
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.000]   Which of those objects are hard?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.280]   Which are the hardest?
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.080]   Talk about or do a little research
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.800]   on where do we find metals?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.720]   And then how do we make other metals?
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:25.280]   Which metals are mined near where you live?
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.960]   Have you ever visited a mine?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.720]   Could you find one to visit?
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:37.440]   Where are the mines in your state or your area located?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.160]   And what kind of tools do miners use?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.360]   Can you find pictures of them?
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.600]   If you can visit a mine or a mining museum or even
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.320]   a natural history museum, you may
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.960]   be able to look at or even touch some of the implements
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.040]   that miners use.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.720]   What about coppersmiths?
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.920]   Have you ever watched a coppersmith work?
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.240]   Do you think you could find one to observe?
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.400]   Maybe they would let you hold their tools.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.920]   You could, after reading these stories,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   go back and pick up some of the words
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.120]   that were unfamiliar to you, some metal vocabulary.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.240]   What is or?
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.440]   What about luster?
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.400]   What do you have to do?
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.560]   What kind of training do you need to become a miner?
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.640]   What are tongs?
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   Who uses an anvil?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.280]   And what do you do to get rid of rust?
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:53.800]   Consider this quote, "All that glitters is not gold."
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.000]   Do a little research.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.960]   Where does that quote come from?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:06.000]   What did it mean in the context of our stories about metals?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.560]   And what might that quotation mean metaphorically?
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.160]   Is there a lesson that we could learn,
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:21.560]   both from our metal stories and from other pieces
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.680]   of literature?
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.440]   And then it might be a lot of fun
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:34.000]   to think about how life changed for people
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.960]   as metals were discovered.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:45.080]   How did people live before they had hard, strong, resilient
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.480]   tools?
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.840]   What would we do today without metals?
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.680]   Look around.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.000]   Sit still in your house or wherever you're sitting
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.600]   and just look and see how many things you can see
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.960]   that are made out of metals.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.440]   Think about what could be used instead of metal
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.000]   to make that object.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.600]   Would it stand up as well?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   Use your imagination.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.880]   What else could you use to make the objects of metal
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   that you see around you?
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.000]   What else would you like to make if you
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.360]   were a coppersmith or a blacksmith
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:39.080]   and could make tools or other implements out of metal?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:44.280]   Hopefully, this gives you some scope both for your imagination
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.720]   and for curiosity, things that you
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.680]   might like to explore as a family in another book,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.840]   in your neighborhood, at a museum,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.680]   maybe even online.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.360]   Go and explore together and let your reading from today
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.800]   be a gateway into more conversation.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.880]   If you are looking for other stories to read,
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.840]   I want to remind you that the Copper Lodge Library includes
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.640]   a lot of titles.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.480]   And new to the Copper Lodge Library this year
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.120]   is a volume called English Epic Poetry.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960]   It has a collection of stories, including selections
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.680]   from Canterbury Tales, selections from Paradise Lost,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.240]   from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.040]   You can build a family culture of reading
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.440]   by enjoying these stories together
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.520]   and having meaningful conversations about wisdom,
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.480]   about virtue.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.440]   Even the less overtly religious poems
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.720]   include Christian themes like courage and forgiveness
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.320]   and the right use of power, things
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.080]   that will get some good conversations started
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.960]   at your house.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   So don't just stick to the Copper Lodge titles
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.160]   that I've been sharing with you this summer.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.480]   Branch out and check out English Epic Poetry.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.280]   And I will see you guys next week.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.840]   Bye-bye.
