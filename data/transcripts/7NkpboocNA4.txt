[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   It is Friday. Let's talk about food. Ever since a tablecloth filled with animals descended
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.960]   from heaven before Peter and a vision, the kitchen doors have been flung wide open to
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.040]   all sorts of delicious dishes we have come to love, including bacon and lobster and coconut
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   shrimp and bluefin tuna sushi, on and on it goes. But there's still a lingering question
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.360]   over whether veganism more closely maps on to God's original dietary design for us. And
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520]   it's a question that comes to us from Scott in Cincinnati.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.080]   "Dear Pastor John, several of my friends are either vegans or vegetarians, and while they
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.720]   are mostly non-Christians, they occasionally challenge me theologically for eating meat.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.000]   I see in scripture that God provided quail for the Israelites in the wilderness. He demanded
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.800]   animal sacrifices. Jesus, after the resurrection, ate broiled fish. Peter, of course, was given
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.520]   a vision of animals clean to eat. But before the fall, they point out that God gave man
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.000]   only seed-yielding plants and the fruit from trees for food. And in eternity, instead of
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.340]   killing animals, the lion shall eat straw like the ox and no further blood will be shed.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.880]   The more I think about this, I am unconvinced that eating meat is sinful. But isn't veganism
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.280]   closer to God's original pre-fall and even post-fall dietary design for us?"
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.960]   What moves me in regard to eating patterns is that neither Jesus nor the apostles, though
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.840]   they had many opportunities to do so, neither of them argued from a pre-fall eating pattern
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.200]   forward or a future eschatological eating pattern backward to the way we should eat
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.160]   today. They didn't argue that way. Such an argument would have solved some serious problems
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.640]   in the church in Corinth and Rome, but Paul did not take that approach. In fact, he emphatically
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.920]   went in another direction. And I suspect that the reason he didn't argue that way and went
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.320]   in another direction is because he saw that God did not intend for either the pre-fall
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:31.800]   world or the post-sin world to provide the model of eating in this world. The risen Christ,
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:40.560]   with his new resurrection body, is the closest glimpse that we get of eating in the age to
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:51.720]   come, and he ate fish—dead fish. Now, instead of arguing that way, Paul argued like this.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.600]   This is 1 Corinthians 10:24. "Let no one seek his own good but the good of his neighbor.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.360]   for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof." That's a quote from Psalm 24
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   that Paul uses as a ground clause. The whole question of meat offered to idols would have
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.440]   been solved for Paul if he had taken the position that eating meat is sub-Christian in any
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:41.040]   case. He argued just the opposite. Animals which provide meat do not belong to themselves.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.280]   They don't belong to the earth. They belong to the Lord who provides his people with their
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.440]   needs for food, so eat them. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. That
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.160]   was Paul's argument for eating meat. And lest we think that Paul was off on his own
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:12.080]   here, Mark, in his gospel, chapter 7, verse 19, said, "Jesus declared all foods clean"
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.360]   (Mark 7, 19). Clean, acceptable, not banned, not illegal. But here's the most important
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.120]   and urgent biblical teaching regarding the patterns of eating among Christians today.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   This is a classic and explicit illustration of what ought not to divide Christians or
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.160]   hinder our precious and close and sweet fellowship with each other. This was Paul's main concern
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.960]   in dealing with eating of meat. Romans 14 is written to deal explicitly with the conflict
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.080]   between vegetarians and meat eaters. It is astonishingly relevant for Scott's question.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.220]   There are other issues in Romans 14, like what days should be honored and whether we
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.160]   should drink wine, but vegetarianism and meat eating are front and center. So here's what
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.800]   he says. This is Romans 12, 2, following. "One person believes he may eat anything,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.680]   while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:41.160]   abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:49.120]   has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.080]   own master that he stands or falls, and he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.240]   him stand." There's the central concern and the central teaching on this issue, according
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:15.840]   to Paul. Meat eaters don't despise vegetarians. Vegetarians don't pass judgment on meat eaters.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.760]   On such issues, each of us stands before the Lord to give his own account. Don't become
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   lords judging each other on this issue. That's the main message. Then verse 14, "I know
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.640]   and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   anyone who thinks it unclean. For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.560]   no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died."
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.680]   Romans 14, verses 14 to 15. Then he continues on. Verse 17, "For the kingdom of God is
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.520]   not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.800]   Spirit. Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men." Then one more
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.160]   section, verses 20 and 21, still in Romans 14. "Do not for the sake of food destroy
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:32.520]   the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:42.160]   stumble by what he eats. It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:51.360]   causes your brother to stumble." Don't cause a brother to stumble into sin and destruction
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.920]   by what you eat. That's not love. So in Paul's mind, the issue of vegetarian
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:07.200]   versus meat eater is not an issue of health. It's not an issue of attaining the ideal of
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:19.120]   pre-fall or post-sin eschatological conditions. It is an issue of love. And in that sense,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:27.200]   it's a great issue. But in only that sense, it's not a great issue in and of itself. What
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:36.120]   we eat here—hear me on this, this is going to shock some—what we eat here is of almost
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:45.800]   zero significance compared to righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   the manifestations of the saving reign of God among his people. So let's keep things
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.360]   in perspective. Manifest the reign of God and love one another.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.880]   That's a wonderful little biblical theology of food. Thank you, Pastor John. And you're
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.480]   exactly right. It's interesting how often food is discussed in the epistles. It's surprising,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.320]   really. Thank you, Pastor John. And Scott, thanks for the question. And listeners, thank

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.540]   we Christians in this life are sinners still. Sin will not be eradicated from our lives
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.420]   until a glorious day when we see Jesus face to face. But until that glorious moment, we
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.600]   fight sin by faith and we can experience assurance inside of that fight. But the Reformed tradition
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.800]   has also taught that there are forms of willful sin, willful sin, that evidences a heart that
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:13.560]   has not been saved. So what is the difference between unwilled sin and willful sin? That's
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.200]   the question on Monday. Until then, I'm your host, Tony Rank. You have a great weekend
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.240]   and we'll see you next week.
