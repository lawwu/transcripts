[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Most of you will recall that in our study of the Epistle to the Romans we have arrived
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.520]   at the 16th verse in the 12th chapter, the 12th chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.320]   verse 16.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.920]   "Be of the same mind one toward another.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.120]   Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.800]   Be not wise in your own conceits."
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.360]   Now, this is the third Friday evening that we've been considering these injunctions that
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.240]   are recorded here at the end of this chapter, beginning at the 14th verse and going on to
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.240]   the end of the chapter.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:54.080]   Here, as I've been indicating, the Apostle is teaching us how we are to react to the
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.440]   things that happen to us and to people.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.800]   He's already told us how we are to behave towards others.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.720]   Here, he's telling us how we are to react to others and to what they do to us.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.760]   And we have already seen that he's told us to bless them which persecute us and bless
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.080]   them and not curse them.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.480]   We've also been told to rejoice with them that do rejoice and to weep with them that
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   weep.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   But now in this 16th verse, he comes and makes this special appeal to us about having a common
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   mind.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.480]   "Be of the same mind one toward another."
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.960]   He's emphasizing the importance of agreement amongst God's people in the church.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   It's the only way to have harmony in the church.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.880]   Now I must remind you again that the two statements, really, the two verses that govern the whole
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.680]   of this section are verses 9 and 10.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.840]   "Let love," he says, "be without dissimulation.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   Abhor that which is evil.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.240]   Cleave to that which is good.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.040]   Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another."
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   Now there are the controlling principles.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.640]   And from there on, he goes on to work those out and to show us how they are to apply in
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360]   the particular details of our lives.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.400]   Now that, of course, is a great appeal again for this agreement, this common mind that
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.200]   he's talking about here in this 16th verse.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.880]   "Be of the same mind one toward another."
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   And then, as is his custom, as a very wise teacher, he goes on to show us that there
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.000]   are two things that tend to militate against Christian people having this same mind one
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.680]   toward another in the church.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.360]   Two main things we've got to watch.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.560]   The first one is the one that he puts in these words, "Mind not high things, but condescend
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.840]   to men of low estate."
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.800]   We dealt with that last Friday.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.240]   That is a warning to us to beware of haughtiness, haughtiness and ambition.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   Minding high things, both in understanding and in living and in any other respect, anything
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.400]   that is high, that exalts itself.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.000]   That's haughtiness, the spirit of haughtiness and ambition.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.800]   And he's told us that the way to safeguard ourselves against that is this.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   It's a bad translation, this "condescend to men of low estate."
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.000]   It means, as I told you, let yourselves be carried along with lowly things and lowly
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   people.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.440]   As long as you do that, you'll never go astray in that respect.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   Very well.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.680]   There's the first danger.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.960]   Haughtiness and high-mindedness tend to militate against this harmony, this agreement, this
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.840]   unity in the church.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.440]   But now, he says another thing, and this is the thing we are dealing with tonight.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   The second danger is this.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   Be not wise in your own conceits.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.440]   Now here is another most important thing.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.040]   The apostle has already said this.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.080]   We found it in the previous chapter, chapter 11, in verse 25, where he says, "I would
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.680]   not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   your own conceits."
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.160]   There he was telling these Gentiles not to become puffed up because the Jews were failing
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160]   for the time being.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   Don't be wise in your own conceits.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   Don't exaggerate your own importance.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   Don't overestimate yourselves.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.240]   Well now, here it is once more.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.680]   Be not wise in your own conceits.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.640]   Now the literal translation of these words is this.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.200]   Be not wise with yourselves.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   Be not wise with yourselves.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.120]   What he means by that is this.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.880]   Don't talk to yourself about your own wisdom.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.320]   Don't talk to yourself about yourself and congratulate yourself on your great wisdom.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.480]   You remember the apostle Paul in speaking and putting up his defense, as it were, before
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.640]   Agrippa and Festus.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.200]   He says that before his conversion, "I barely thought with myself."
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   And that was his whole trouble.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.900]   That is the whole trouble with the unregenerate, with the unconverted person.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.960]   He always thinks with himself.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.280]   He's always talking to himself.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.400]   Every unconverted man is a kind of mutual admiration society.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.520]   He talks to himself about himself.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.080]   And especially, as the apostle indicates here, about his own wisdom.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   Now here is a great warning against intellectual pride.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:55.400]   A man boasting of his wisdom, proud of his wisdom, glorying to himself in his own wisdom.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.800]   Wise with himself concerning this matter.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.160]   Now this is the most important subject.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.000]   The whole history of the church shows the damage that has accrued as a result of Christian
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   people not observing this particular injunction.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.720]   It is something against which we must always guard ourselves to the fullest possible extent.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   Well now, let's look at it.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.160]   And let's look at it like this.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.640]   I laid down as a first proposition that this is the greatest of all sins.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.760]   That the greatest of all sins is the sin of intellectual pride.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.000]   I don't hesitate to assert that it's a greater pride than what John calls the pride of life.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.240]   You remember John in his first epistle in the second chapter talks about the lust of
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.720]   That of course is another danger.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.240]   Worldliness or worldly mindedness.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.800]   And that is a terrible sin.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.060]   But I say this is greater.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.760]   And I say that for a number of reasons.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.040]   There is something which is rather foolish I feel about the pride of life.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.640]   It's ostentatious and that always makes it look rather ridiculous.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.600]   A kind of vain show.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.440]   But this is much more subtle.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.680]   Why do I say this is the greatest of all sins?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.480]   Well it was the sin of the devil himself.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.820]   That was exactly the sin of the devil.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.220]   Pitting his wisdom against that of God.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.420]   He was a created being and God had endowed him with a mind and understanding.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.100]   But he became proud of it.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.500]   He inflated it and his own idea of it and that was the cause of his downfall.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.140]   And as you remember it was the first sin of men.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.420]   The devil in his subtlety tempted Eve along that very line.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.540]   This idea that they could become as gods knowing everything.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.680]   Wisdom.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.120]   And as it was the first sin and the cause of the original fall of men it has continued
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.620]   to be the greatest of all sins for that reason.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.300]   But look at it like this.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.900]   It is the greatest sin also because it is the abuse of God's greatest gift to men.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.220]   When I say greatest gift I'm not thinking of course of the spirit as such but I'm thinking
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.700]   of the particular gifts and propensities and faculties that we have as human beings.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.140]   The things that especially differentiate us from the animal.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.180]   And this undoubtedly is the greatest gift that God has given to men.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.980]   This gift of reason.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.760]   The gift of understanding.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.460]   The gift of thought.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.540]   The gift of being able to assess things and so on.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.700]   This is the greatest gift.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:57.140]   And obviously therefore to abuse the greatest gift of all is clearly the greatest sin of
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   all.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.780]   Or look at it in this way.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.940]   It is our minds that really ought to be saving us from most of the mistakes we make and most
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.460]   of the wrong things we do.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.580]   That is where a man is more inexcusable than a child.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.060]   You can excuse a child when it does certain things that are wrong because it's a child.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.060]   It doesn't understand.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.820]   And it would be very cruel and very wrong to expect a kind of adult form of behavior
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   from a child.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.180]   But when we cease to be children and grow up, well then it's right to expect of us
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.380]   that we can think and reason and understand and be responsible.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:43.420]   Well now the mind of all the faculties that we have is the one that should enable us to
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.860]   live in a worthy, in a true and in a sensible manner as we put it.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:56.740]   So if you sin in this respect and abuse this gift, well obviously you are abusing this
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.060]   thing that God has given you to safeguard you from your troubles.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.340]   And there is no greater sin than that.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:11.620]   So I say again that here the apostle in putting it like this in this aphoristic, pithy manner
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.780]   is really putting before us one of the most important things we can ever consider together.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.460]   Be not wise in your own conceits.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.020]   Now we've got to examine this.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.420]   What does he mean by being wise in your own conceits?
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.980]   Now this is something that can take two forms and it's important that we should consider
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.620]   both the forms.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:46.220]   The one form is knowledge and the other is wisdom.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.380]   And it's important we should be able to draw the distinction between knowledge and wisdom.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.140]   Did you notice in the reading at the beginning in the third chapter of James, in the thirteenth
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:03.820]   verse we read this, "Who is a wise man and endowed with knowledge among you?"
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.580]   A wise man, but there's something else, "endowed with knowledge."
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.260]   Wisdom and knowledge are not the same thing.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.340]   They are very closely related of course, but it's very essential that we should realize
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.860]   that they're not the same thing.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.300]   What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge?
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.220]   Well it can be put like this.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:32.460]   Knowledge is information, awareness of things, discovery of things, becoming acquainted with
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.740]   things.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.780]   It is something that you can be taught and something that you acquire as the result of
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.260]   instruction in that way.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:48.100]   Now there's no need for me to elaborate this because we're living in an age that is in
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.460]   a sense given to the acquiring of knowledge.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.780]   The age of encyclopedias, the age in which people are listening to instruction, which
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.220]   they get information in many different forms on the television and other places, these
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   quizzes as they're called.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.260]   They're all giving you knowledge, what you know, and you get your knowledge.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.100]   Now that's knowledge, it's the gathering and the acquiring of a certain number of facts,
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100]   large or small.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.780]   That is what knowledge consists of, an awareness of facts.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780]   But what is wisdom?
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.420]   Ah, here's the important point.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.320]   It is something really which is essentially different.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.000]   You can be a man of great knowledge and yet entirely lacking in wisdom.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.660]   On the contrary, you can be a man of great wisdom but have very little knowledge.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.820]   So it is important that we should be clear as to the relationship between these two things.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.820]   What is wisdom?
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.020]   Well, you can define wisdom, if you like, as the power and the capacity to use and to
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.020]   apply your knowledge.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.980]   Now you see the distinction.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:06.460]   A man may have great knowledge but he may lack this capacity to make use of his knowledge,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.140]   to apply his knowledge.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.260]   Now, perhaps my simplest way of putting this to you would be to say that the whole tragedy
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.780]   of the world at this present moment is that it has vast knowledge but is terribly lacking
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.780]   in wisdom.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.820]   Look at the knowledge we've got, scientifically.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.420]   But why is the world as it is?
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   Why is it nervous?
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.220]   Why is it in a state of tension tonight?
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   Well, because men's wisdom has not grown in a commensurate manner with his knowledge.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.900]   He's acquired this vast knowledge, he doesn't know how to use it.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.940]   That's because it lacks wisdom.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:48.500]   Wisdom is this power, this faculty, this ability to make use of what you know to good ends
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.900]   and to worthy ends.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.180]   Something that one could illustrate in many ways.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:00.740]   I may have illustrated it in this way to you before, but I remember many years ago when
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:09.060]   I was trying to do a little medicine, a friend and colleague of mine, who was a perfect illustration,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.540]   I always feel, that's why I always use him when I'm trying to bring out this point,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.900]   showing the difference between having knowledge and being able to use it.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.940]   He was an excellent student in the sense that he was good at reading textbooks.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.820]   He had a wonderful memory, he could almost remember them verbatim and recite some of
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820]   them.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.220]   And he was a good examinee.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.980]   He could answer questions theoretically.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:36.980]   But I remember on many occasions seeing that man confronted by an actual patient with not
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:44.580]   a very difficult disease, and he seemed quite incapable of applying his great book knowledge
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.140]   to the particular case that was in front of him.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.820]   He was a very learned man theoretically.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.700]   He was a very poor clinician, a poor doctor.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.460]   He couldn't use the knowledge that he had, he couldn't apply it.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.940]   Now you will know of similar instances in almost every walk and department of life.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.420]   Now that is the essential difference, if you like, between knowledge and wisdom.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.580]   Now of course knowledge should lead to wisdom, but it doesn't, of necessity.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.620]   That is where we have to be careful in drawing this distinction.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.140]   The learned man is not of necessity, a wise man.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.660]   And the whole trouble in the world today is that it's exalting men of mere knowledge,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.660]   sometimes very clever men.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.700]   But the men can be very clever and yet lacking in wisdom.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:35.500]   And it is the failure to differentiate between these two things, as I say, that causes so
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   many of our trouble.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   It should be the case that the more we know, the wiser we become.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.500]   But because of sin it doesn't follow, and hence the troubles of the human race.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.860]   Well now then you can see that this can take two forms.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:58.060]   A man who is wise in his own conceit can be proud of his knowledge, or he can be proud
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.340]   of his wisdom.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.060]   But in both cases he is wise in his own conceit.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.260]   The first man, not able to draw the distinction between the two, thinks that his knowledge
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   means wisdom.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.460]   And so he goes round.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.420]   The second man hasn't much knowledge, but he thinks he's a wise man and he may be a
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.940]   wise man.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:24.100]   And people give him that impression and praise him as a wise man, and he becomes conceited
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.500]   and proud about it.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.140]   So it can happen in those two ways.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.820]   Well now then, here's the great question.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.420]   Why is this so wrong?
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.500]   Why does the apostle say, "Don't be wise with yourself, don't be wise in your own conceit"?
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   Why?
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.420]   Well, I want to give you a number of answers to that question.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.420]   Here's the first.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.860]   The first answer is this.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.260]   Don't be wise in your own conceit because it really isn't true.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.620]   You've got nothing to be proud of.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.140]   You're deluding yourself.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.140]   You're fooling yourself.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.140]   Take it in this question of knowledge.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.860]   Take a man who's very proud of his knowledge.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.300]   The thing to say to him really is this.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.460]   What do we really know?
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.300]   But he says, "I know this, that, and the other."
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.260]   But then point out to him what he doesn't know.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.180]   You'll find always that the truly great scholar is a modest man.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.820]   The old adage puts it perfectly.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.340]   A little learning is a dangerous thing.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.020]   It's a little learning that tends to turn our heads and make us think we know everything.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.140]   The more a man knows, the more he realizes what he doesn't know.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.540]   So the greater the scholar, the humbler the man, almost invariably.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.460]   So it's very wrong to be proud of your knowledge.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.700]   You know, the apostle, of course, the apostle Paul puts this very well himself, dealing
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.780]   with this very thing in writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle in chapter 8 in the first
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.780]   two verses.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.420]   Now he says that touching things are for two idols.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   We know that we all have knowledge.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.220]   If any man think that he...
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.660]   No, knowledge puffeth up a charity edifier.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:07.420]   Then in the second verse, "And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.700]   nothing yet as he ought to know."
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.300]   And that's the simple truth.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.380]   So when you're tempted to be proud of your knowledge, just remind yourself of what you
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.380]   don't know.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.060]   Look how he puts it again in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:32.300]   "Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face."
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.100]   He says, "We know in part and we prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect is
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.580]   come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.260]   How little our knowledge is.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.220]   It's only as in a glass darkly.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.020]   It's only a partial knowledge at the very best.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:55.060]   And again in Philippians 3, this same apostle with his wonderful knowledge of the Lord says,
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.700]   "Now I am fully apprehended."
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.820]   He thanks God for what he has got, but he's pressing on toward the mark.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.060]   Oh, there's so much to be possessed and he's got so little.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.460]   So you see, it really isn't true in the matter of knowledge.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.420]   That's where the world again goes mad, isn't it, at the present time.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.780]   Boasting of its knowledge.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.380]   It is wonderful knowledge as long as we don't boast about it.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.340]   But when you think of what we don't know, our ignorance is appalling.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.300]   And of course, it's exactly the same with regard to wisdom.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.020]   Who is there who hasn't made many a mistake in life?
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.500]   The wisest men often behave as a fool.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.460]   One of the wisest men in the whole of the Old Testament is Solomon.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.580]   But look at the story of Solomon.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.300]   Look at the end of his life.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.020]   What a fool he made of himself.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.660]   This wise man, you remember when he begins, and the wisdom he displayed.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.940]   Those two women and the two children, you remember, and one of them had died.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.580]   This amazing wisdom of Solomon.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   He was famous for his wisdom.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.420]   The men of the Proverbs and probably of the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.980]   And yet in his personal life, how unwise he was.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.940]   How foolish he was.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.180]   And it is the same with all of us.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.180]   The moment you're tempted, therefore, to be proud of your wisdom and to boast of your
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:26.780]   wisdom, just look back across your life and see the mistakes you've made.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.220]   And it'll humble you and keep you in order.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.660]   And remember what the apostle says in the first chapter of this epistle to the Romans
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.660]   in verse 22.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.620]   He says, "This is what has happened to the whole human race, professing themselves to
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.540]   be wise.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.340]   They became fools."
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.420]   And look at the world today and all its supposed wisdom.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.420]   Has it ever been madder than it is today?
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.780]   It boasts of its understanding, its knowledge, its wisdom, its capacity.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.500]   But look what it's doing.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.340]   And we've seen it all, haven't we, so often in individuals, men in the learned professions
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.180]   and others, men of great knowledge, indeed men who can often give very good advice to
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.180]   other people.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.260]   Their own lives are a tragedy.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.660]   The failure of wisdom.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.140]   So you see, if you tend to boast about your wisdom, you're probably doing something that
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   isn't true.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.140]   So don't do it.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.140]   It's a lie.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.060]   And then secondly, consider this.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.340]   Whatever wisdom you've got, whatever knowledge you've got, you've got nothing to boast of.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.660]   You haven't produced them.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.460]   You haven't created them.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:37.820]   If you've got that sort of blotting paper kind of mind and memory that can absorb facts
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.700]   and make you a good student, well, you didn't produce it.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.700]   You were born with it.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.900]   You may have taken up schemes to help it, but if you haven't got something there to
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.420]   start with, you won't get very far with all the schemes.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.700]   And with your wisdom, if you're given a natural gift of wisdom, well, you didn't produce it.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.700]   So don't boast of it.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.340]   It isn't to your credit.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.180]   Read again 1 Corinthians 3, and you'll find the apostle deals with it there at great
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.180]   length.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.180]   But let me go on to something still more important.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:14.660]   Be wise in your own conceits, because if you do, if you are, it'll do you great harm.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.900]   It'll do you great harm.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:24.140]   Did you notice how Paul puts it there in 1 Corinthians 8, "One knowledge puffeth up,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.580]   inflates."
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.800]   But what does it inflate with?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   What does inflate?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   Gas, air.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   It's not real.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   It's not solid.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:39.320]   It doesn't build up, he says, as love builds up.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.720]   Knowledge puffeth up.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.880]   It appears to be very big, but it's nothing but a balloon.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   It's just an inflated pile.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   It's filled with air, not with real substance.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.600]   And it's a very bad thing when a man becomes like a balloon, just puffed up in pride.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.560]   It's very devastating to a man's personality, to his whole outlook upon himself and upon
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.600]   life.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.060]   But I can put this perhaps best to your consideration by putting it like this.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:19.120]   To be proud in our own conceit is to make us guilty of the very things that this same
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.600]   apostle tells us in 1 Corinthians 13 are not true of love.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.080]   Now that sounds complicated, doesn't it?
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.400]   You remember 1 Corinthians 13, called sometimes, "Call him to love."
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.680]   And there you remember he tells us negatively and positively about love.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.160]   But I'm interested at the moment in the negatives.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.920]   He tells us, first of all, a few positives.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   Now if you are proud of your own wisdom, if you're birthed of your own wisdom, and if
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.520]   you're wise in your own conceit, you will be the opposite of what he says here about
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520]   love.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   This is what he tells us.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.040]   "Charity suffereth long and is kind."
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:11.320]   For the man who's puffed up never suffers long and is never kind.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.880]   "Charity envieth not."
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.200]   The other always does, invariably.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   "Charity vaunteth not itself, but knowledge puffeth up."
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.120]   Vaunteth itself, exaggerates itself, makes itself bigger than it really is, becomes a
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   lie.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320]   Charity doesn't do that.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   And then, "is not puffed up."
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   There it is, the same phrase.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.680]   Puffed up, blown up, inflated.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.520]   He says it doesn't behave itself unseemly.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.040]   The truly wise man never behaves himself unseemly.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.720]   But the man who thinks he's wise does so very often, because the very fact that he's proud
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.200]   of his wisdom makes him lose his balance, and then he does things that are unseemly.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.280]   Then, "seeketh not her own."
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.880]   But the man who's proud of his intellect, he's always seeking his own.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.200]   He's seeking admiration, he's seeking applause.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.600]   He wants everybody to say, "what a wise man he is, look at him, or this man of knowledge."
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   Always seeking his own.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.560]   Then, "is not easily provoked."
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.640]   The wise man isn't easily provoked.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   But the man who's got some pseudo-wisdom, he can be easily provoked.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.720]   "Thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:33.160]   Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.080]   Charity never faileth."
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   Now, "there" is a very good description.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:45.840]   It's there in terms of love, but it is equally true of true wisdom.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.920]   And therefore the man, you see, who's puffed up, he proves he hasn't got true wisdom.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.000]   And he becomes the opposite of what we are told there about the men of love or the men
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.080]   of true wisdom.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.520]   So it does him very great harm.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.080]   Nothing can do a man greater harm than to be wise in his own conceit.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.560]   And that in turn, in the fourth place, leads him, of course, to do harm to others, as we
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   were told there in those verses that I've just read to you.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.880]   A proud man, in any sense, is always a very difficult man, difficult to live with, behaves
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.440]   badly, and others suffer because of this.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.920]   So he not only does himself harm, he does other people harm.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.200]   So we mustn't be proud in our own conceits.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.280]   We must avoid all this.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.200]   But then I want to give you a fifth reason for observing this injunction of the great
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   apostle.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.120]   Don't be wise in your own conceits because if you are, it'll place you in an extremely
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.320]   dangerous position.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.000]   There is no more dangerous position that you can ever be in than the danger that results
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.560]   from being wise in our own conceits.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   What am I talking about?
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:03.400]   Well, again the proverb puts it perfectly, "Pride cometh before a fall."
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   It is invariable.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:10.720]   You've got it in many places in the scripture.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.160]   Take 1 Corinthians 10 and the 12th verse.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   Here's a verse for people who are in this danger.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:24.720]   "Wherefore, let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   Or again, I would remind you of Galatians 6 and the 3rd verse, where we read this, "If
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.840]   a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.480]   And that's what the man who is proud of his wisdom does.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.160]   He thinks himself to be wise when he isn't.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.560]   He thinks himself to be something when he is nothing.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.800]   He deceives himself.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.000]   But again, come back to James 3.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.680]   "My brethren, be not many masters."
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   Being many masters means don't be authorities.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.120]   Don't regard yourselves as wise men, as leaders.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.800]   Don't set yourselves up in these positions of leadership.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   Why not?
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   "Knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.880]   For in many things we offend all.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.680]   If any men offend not in word, the same is the perfect men, and they behold should have
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.880]   brightened the whole body."
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   But this is what he's saying.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.400]   This is the argument of James.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   Don't be many masters.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   Why not?
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:29.760]   Well, for this good reason, that you're setting up a standard for yourself.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.320]   You're saying, "I'm a wise man.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   I know."
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.600]   "You will receive the greater condemnation.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.800]   God will take you at your own valuation."
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.440]   He says, "Now then, you used to claim when you were on earth that you were very wise
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.760]   men, and men of great learning and knowledge and understanding and wisdom.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   Very well.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.160]   This is what you said about yourself.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   I'll test you.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   I'll examine you.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.320]   I'll try you in terms of the very claims you've put forward for yourself.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.440]   The result will be you'll receive greater condemnation.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.120]   If you set this very high standard for yourself, your fall, your failure, your condemnation
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.480]   will be correspondingly great."
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.320]   And James, of course, in saying that, is but re-echoing the words of our blessed Lord and
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.960]   Master, who puts it like this in the Sermon on the Mount, beginning of chapter 7 of Matthew's
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   Gospel.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.280]   "Judge not that it be not judged.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.240]   For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.360]   And with what measure you meet you, it shall be measured to you again.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.760]   There it is once and forever.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.920]   You set up your standard for yourself as a great man of wisdom.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Very well.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.440]   And you'll condemn others, and you'll show their failures in knowledge or in wisdom,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.680]   but you'll be judged by the very standard that you yourself have been applying to those
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.880]   people.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.640]   You are really bringing judgment of the severest kind upon yourself.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:30:00.160]   A man who is proud of his own wisdom is a man who is putting himself in the most dangerous
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.440]   position possible.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.320]   He will have to meet his own standard at the bar of eternal judgment.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.520]   With what measure you judge, you shall be judged.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.760]   It shall be measured to you again.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.840]   There is nothing, therefore, that is more dangerous than this.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.400]   We mustn't be many masters.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.360]   We mustn't set ourselves up as judges in this way, for that will be the consequence
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   to us.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.040]   But for me to wind up this bit of argumentation under this particular heading as to why we
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.200]   should avoid this, my final answer, of course, is the most important one of all.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:47.760]   Any man who is wise in his own conceit is the exact antithesis of our blessed Lord and
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.840]   Master.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.680]   He was eternally different.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.520]   Do you remember what he says?
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.960]   Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.600]   That's how he puts it about himself.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.680]   And that was his character.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.520]   The bruised reed, he will not break.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.120]   The smoking flecks, he will not quench.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   Here he is, son of God incarnate.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.120]   Do you know what he said?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.000]   He said, "I know nothing of myself."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   He said, "The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.440]   The Father that sent me, he gave me the words, he gives me the words."
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.000]   This is our Lord incarnate.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.800]   He is living life as a man.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.200]   And he says he is utterly dependent upon the Father.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.180]   What he says is given to him.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.960]   What he does is given to him.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.240]   He doesn't do anything himself.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.480]   He does what is being given to him in every single respect.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.520]   The words I speak unto you, I speak not of myself.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.680]   I don't generate them, I don't produce them.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   Far from boasting of his wisdom, he is the meek and lowly Jesus.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.680]   That's the astounding thing that one finds as one looks at him in these portraits in
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   the four Gospels.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:15.000]   Though he is who he is, the lowliness, the meekness, the humility of the Son of God incarnate,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:24.480]   he is the perpetual rebuke to all men who are tempted to feel wise in their own conceits.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.520]   Very well, there are sufficient reasons without reducing any more as to why we should avoid
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.240]   this with all the power that we are capable of.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.280]   But that leads me to my last general matter this evening.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   How do we deal with this danger?
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   It's a danger that confronts all of us in a measure.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.480]   We differ in these respects.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.620]   Some men are more in danger at this point than others.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.940]   But it's a danger to all of us.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.640]   What can we do about this?
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.240]   How are we to avoid being wise in our own conceits?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.600]   Well, I hurry a negative that I may leave it.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.640]   It doesn't mean false modesty.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.480]   It doesn't just mean that you have to go about trying to give the impression that you're
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.800]   an ignoramus and that you're entirely lacking in wisdom.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.000]   That's no good.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.880]   The Uriah Heap type of person is never commended in the Scriptures anywhere.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.480]   If you are a man of ability and a man of wisdom, well, very well, you are.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.440]   And it's nonsense to say that you're not.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.760]   So it doesn't mean false modesty.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.720]   It doesn't mean an affectation of humility.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   That's abominable all of us.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   Well, what do we do about this?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   Well, it's quite clear.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.160]   There's abundant teaching in the Scripture about this.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.400]   There are certain general things that can save us.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   What are they?
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.400]   Well, here's the first.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.840]   Walk humbly with thy God.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.440]   Remind yourself of the things I said at the beginning, of what you don't know and the
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.640]   mistakes you've made and your fallibility.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.480]   But above all, walk humbly with thy God.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Walk unto Jesus.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.720]   Follow him in this respect as in every other respect.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.160]   Walk humbly with thy God.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   What else?
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.440]   Well, remember the injunction of Paul again in Philippians 2.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.400]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.720]   Fear and trembling.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.280]   Now we've rather tended to forget this, haven't we?
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.360]   This hasn't been popular in the 20th century.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.080]   We are bright and breezy Christians.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.760]   But Paul says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   Not because it's uncertain.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.480]   Not because your salvation or the end is uncertain.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.360]   In a sense, you do it in fear and trembling because you are certain of the end.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.440]   You know you're doing it under the eye of God.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   You know that you're his child and your responsibility is tremendous.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.560]   But you're afraid of letting your father down, letting your family down, letting your
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.560]   home down.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   Fear and trembling.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:07.200]   If you're a truly wise man, you'll know the evil that's in this world.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.480]   You'll see it, the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   Yes, the devil and his subtlety and his insinuation.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.600]   You'll realize it's a terrifying world to live in.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.920]   So you walk in fear and trembling.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.480]   And then remember the other words of the apostle, how he tells us that when he first went to
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:32.760]   preach in Corinth, he went in weakness and in fear and in much trembling once more.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.840]   Look at this man, this great man, this mighty man, this apostle Paul, this outstanding genius.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.760]   I can't praise him too much, can I?
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.000]   My language fails me.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   But look at him.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.600]   Here's the man of all men who does things in fear and trembling.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.640]   Not self-confident and assured in his evangelism or in anything else.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   Fear and trembling.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   Why?
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.880]   Oh, the sacredness of the task.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:03.560]   His blessed Lord and Master would entrust him with this wonderful treasure of the gospel.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.840]   Fear that in any way he might stand between the people and this, or detract from it in
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.320]   any way, or make it more difficult for them.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.120]   He realized the forces that were meeting together when he was preaching the gospel.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.000]   And he was fearful lest in any way he might fail.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.200]   He couldn't rely on anything in himself.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.960]   Not with enticing words of men's wisdom or anything else.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   In demonstration of the spirit and of power.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.480]   Now these are general things that we ought never to forget.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.680]   They ought to be controlling the whole of our outlook and all our activity.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   Or as James puts it again, in a very wonderful phrase at the end of the thirteenth verse
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.320]   of that third chapter.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:49.560]   Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:55.000]   The opposite, you see, of being wise in your own conceit, puffed up with knowledge, is
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.880]   meekness of wisdom.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   Which leads me to this.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.080]   That the best way of safeguarding ourselves against this particular danger is to give
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:10.320]   a very hurried exposition of James chapter three, verse thirteen to the end of the chapter.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.840]   Here it is.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:18.960]   Here's the best commentary you'll ever find on the last phrase of Romans twelve, sixteen.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.640]   The best commentary on the scripture always is the scripture itself somewhere else.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.000]   And James seems to have written this in order to expound this wonderful aphorism that we've
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   got here.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Let me read again to you.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.480]   Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among them?
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.540]   Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:42.280]   But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not and lie not against
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   the truth.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.680]   This wisdom, this glorying one, descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.040]   For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.600]   But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.680]   full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.400]   And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   Take a hurried exposition of what that means.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.320]   It means this.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.580]   The way to safeguard yourself against being proud of your wisdom is to learn the difference
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.880]   between true wisdom and false wisdom.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.040]   And then you reject the false and seek the true.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   How do you do it?
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.920]   Well, have a look at the two types of wisdom, the false and the true.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   How do you tell the difference?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.680]   Well, first of all, their origin.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.000]   Where does the wisdom come from?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.640]   The apostle tells us that the true wisdom comes from above, which means from God.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   Where does the other come from?
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.560]   Well, you can start by saying it comes from the earth.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.000]   It is human wisdom.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.600]   It is worldly wisdom.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.800]   It is earthly wisdom.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.840]   But let him expound it himself.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   The characteristics of these two types of wisdom, the one from below and the one from
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   above.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.200]   Look at the wisdom that comes from below.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   What are its characteristics?
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   Well, first, earthly.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   It is earthly.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.480]   It can never rise above that.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.120]   It's clever, but it never rises above men.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.000]   It belongs to this world.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.800]   It knows nothing about the spiritual, nothing about the eternal.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   Always earthly.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.920]   Secondly, he says it's sensual, which means it is soulish.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.000]   There's nothing spiritual about it at all.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   It belongs entirely to that which pertains to the animal part of our nature.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.400]   For understand, our brain and our ability is a part of our animal nature in a sense.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   It lacks the spiritual element.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.000]   It is a psychical or a soulish element.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.240]   It's earthly, it is soulish, not spiritual.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.600]   But then he even goes so far as to say this.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.480]   He says it's devilish.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.640]   There are people who appear to be wise, and they are given the credit for being wise,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.120]   but they're not, says the apostle.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.060]   The wisdom they've got is a devilish wisdom.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.320]   It comes from the devil.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   It's demon-like.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.400]   That's what devilish means.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.760]   It's given by evil spirits, and the evil spirits can be very clever.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.560]   As Paul says, the devil can transform himself into an angel of light, and he says his agents
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.600]   can do exactly the same thing, but this kind of wisdom is a devilish one.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:35.480]   Listen to what Paul therefore says about the election of elders in 1 Timothy 3.6.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.360]   He says, "Don't appoint a novice.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.800]   Left being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.680]   That as I told you at the beginning was pride of wisdom.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.100]   So this wisdom that puffs itself up and is proud of itself is devilish.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.300]   It comes from the devil.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.640]   It can be very clever.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.760]   It can appear to be wonderful, but really it is always not only earthly or soulish,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.640]   it is even devilish.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:09.200]   It's the thing that made the devil the devil from being a bright angelic spirit.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.680]   And then he goes on to tell us how it shows itself.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.320]   And it shows itself, this false wisdom, shows itself always.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   It'll always come out.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   It can't be hidden.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.220]   You never know when it'll come out, but it's always, sooner or later, certain to show itself
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.760]   in what he calls conversation, habit, and way of living.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:37.200]   It shows itself in pride, in envying, in bitterness, in striving, and of course, above everything,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.080]   as he's been telling us earlier in the chapter, in failure to control ourselves and especially
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.800]   our tongues.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.720]   That's the message of this third chapter of James, isn't it?
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:54.380]   The wisdom of the world, the men of the world, the false wisdom, which may be true, remember,
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.900]   of a man who is truly Christian.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.700]   The moment he becomes puffed up about his wisdom, he's proving that he's got worldly
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.020]   wisdom and not the true wisdom.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.220]   And he shows it by lack of control.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:11.780]   Can't control his tongue, says things he shouldn't say, is proud, is envious, is jealous, is
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   bitter.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:18.940]   These are the very words that are used by the apostle in indicating to us the characteristics
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.880]   of this false wisdom.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.260]   It eventually gives itself away, and it's treachery.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   What about the true wisdom?
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.260]   Ah, what a difference.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.260]   Comes from a God.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.260]   Comes from God.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   The only wise God.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.260]   And it, of course, bears the characteristics.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:44.700]   The first thing about it is that it's pure.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:50.660]   There's no admixture, no adulteration, nothing false, nothing pseudo.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.660]   It is pure.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:56.180]   It's a whole, not an alloy.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.980]   And then secondly, he says it is peaceable.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:05.260]   True wisdom is always peaceable, because it always leads to meekness and to humility and
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.260]   so on.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.900]   And the kind of man who's got true wisdom is a peaceable man.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.380]   And then the next thing is, he's gentle.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.380]   He's not puffed up, he's not proud, he's a gentle man.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.140]   Truly a gentle man.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.660]   He's easy to be entreated.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.660]   He's not intolerant.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.260]   You can speak to him, you can approach him.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.620]   He's ready to listen to you.
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.140]   He's not a man who says, "I know everything, nobody else knows anything."
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   No, no.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   He's easy to be entreated.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.700]   You can get on with him.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.860]   He's ready to take advice, he's ready to listen.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   He knows the dangers.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.820]   Full of mercy and of good fruits, of course.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.180]   Without partiality, he's not prejudiced.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.500]   He's a man who's prepared to listen to the other side and to consider it carefully.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.260]   Without partiality, he doesn't decide beforehand.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.980]   He's got this kind of spiritual open mind.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:59.500]   Without hypocrisy, he doesn't pretend to be better than he is or to have more of it than
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.380]   he really has.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:07.140]   And then he ends by saying, "And the fruit of righteousness is shown of them, is shown
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.100]   in peace of them that make peace."
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:16.020]   In other words, it is this great phrase at the end of verse 13, meekness of wisdom.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:20.220]   The man with true wisdom is a humble man.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.020]   He's a man who's got self-control.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.060]   He's in charge of himself.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.860]   He controls his time.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.780]   He controls everything else about himself.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.540]   And he's a peace-loving man.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.100]   He's a peace-making man.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.820]   And this comes out in his life.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.540]   Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.740]   Let him show out of a good conversation.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.540]   It isn't something theoretical.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:50.100]   Wisdom shows itself always in practice, in behavior, in conduct, in daily life and living.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:58.340]   Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.060]   Here is a man who doesn't boast in himself.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.060]   He boasts in God.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.660]   And he says, "I am what I am by the grace of God."
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:13.260]   Very well, the way to safeguard ourselves against this terrible danger is to understand
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   the difference between the false and the true.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:22.140]   Then having realized the difference, to seek for the true wisdom with the whole of your
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.140]   being.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.540]   And he's already told you how to do that in the first chapter of his epistle, James
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.540]   1, 5.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:34.140]   "If any of you lack wisdom," and we all do, "if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:40.740]   God, that giveth to all men liberally, and of prey doth not, and it shall be given him.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.820]   But let him ask in faith, nothing wavereth.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:48.980]   For he that wavereth is like the wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:55.820]   But ask in faith without wavering, and you will be given this true wisdom that comes
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.820]   from above and is of God, that is first pure and then peaceable, and all the other glorious
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.820]   things that characterize it.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:13.460]   And let old John Bunyan, in his usual, practical, down-to-earth manner, let him enforce it by
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.580]   a last word.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:21.140]   He that is down need fear no fall.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.060]   If you're already on the ground, you can't fall.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.900]   If you're already humble, you're in a very safe position.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.020]   It will save you many a bruise, many a hurt, many a trouble.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.220]   He that is down need fear no fall.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.180]   He that is low, no pride.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:50.460]   He that is humble ever shall have God to be his guide, blessed are the weak.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.380]   Here it is, my dear friends.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.820]   May God give us grace to understand these things and to put them into practice.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:05.300]   This is all, as I said at the very beginning, this is all but a part of the original appeal
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:11.060]   to be of the same mind, one toward another.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.420]   You'll never be that if you're proud in your own conceit.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:22.940]   May God therefore give us understanding and so fill us with his Spirit that we shall be
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:31.580]   meek and humble and lowly and our blessed Lord will not be ashamed to own us as his
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.580]   brethren.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:40.860]   O Lord our God, we do indeed thank thee that we can come unto thee.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:47.900]   We acknowledge and confess that we all fail and have failed in many things.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:55.140]   Our knowledge is small, our wisdom is smaller, but thou hast told us to seek this wisdom
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.420]   from thee and thou wilt give it unto us.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:07.780]   God make us wise in the midst of this evil and perverse generation in which we find ourselves.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:20.300]   God give us thy known wisdom, this pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated wisdom and character.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:27.300]   And our desire is to live to thy glory and to thy praise.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:34.860]   And we realize that we can only do this as we are endued and endowed with this blessed
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   wisdom.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.300]   Hear us, O Lord.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:44.220]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:50.980]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:59.300]   the remainder of this our short, uncertain, earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.900]   Amen.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
