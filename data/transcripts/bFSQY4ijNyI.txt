[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Well, Christmas is nearly here and it's a great season to reflect on our
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.720]   anointed King who entered into human history.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.640]   Fully God, fully man, God with us. He came for us. Jesus came not to be
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.920]   served, but to serve. To serve us. Which means
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.360]   Christmas fundamentally highlights our neediness.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.080]   But what are we needy for? That's the million dollar question of Christmas.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.120]   Pastor John answered the question in his 2003 Christmas sermon titled,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.400]   "If the root is holy, the branches are holy."
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.760]   Here's what he said building from Romans chapter 11
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.840]   verses 13 and 14. One of the follies of trying to turn the
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.080]   gospel into a way of meeting felt needs in 21st century America
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.680]   is that the three main needs that the gospel meets are felt by almost
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.440]   nobody. Right here in our text there's an explosive word at the center of the
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.400]   gospel. It's the word "save" or "saved."
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.680]   "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles inasmuch as
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120]   then I am an apostle to the Gentiles. I magnify
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.760]   my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.880]   jealous and thus save some of them." The loud, joyful,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.480]   glorious word at the center of the gospel is
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.040]   "saved." It's what Christmas is all about, right?
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.480]   "Behold, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all the people.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.840]   For unto you this day in the city of David
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.600]   is born a Savior." We need to be saved. You shall call His name Jesus
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   because He will save His people from their sins.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.160]   Right at the center of the meaning of Christmas
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.960]   and the meaning of the gospel is "saved." So, is that one of the felt needs in
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   America in the 21st century? People wake up in
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   the morning, "I need to be saved." Go to bed at night, "I need to be
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   saved." Well, it depends, right? Depends on what you mean by "saved."
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.000]   Saved from what? You need to be saved from financial
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   difficulty. Yeah, that would help. So, that's not an
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.040]   obvious answer. Is that a felt need in America?
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   To be saved? So, let's clarify the three main
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   things that the gospel does in saving. If you want to go with me and
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.640]   see them, chapter 5 of the book of Romans. I don't
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.440]   want to fill up this word "saved" with just my
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.840]   evangelical jargon or my history as a born-again Christian. I want to get it
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.280]   right from the Bible. I want to know what the Bible means by
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.360]   "saved." So, let's start at verse 9, Romans 5, "Since therefore we have now
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.800]   been justified by His blood, much more shall we be
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.480]   saved by Him from the wrath of God." There's need number one,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.320]   met in Jesus. The wrath of God is our biggest problem. If it didn't exist,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.520]   we wouldn't need the gospel. I need to be rescued from the just
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.360]   and holy anger of God against me. That's my main need.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.240]   Salvation from the anger and wrath of omnipotent God
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.760]   against me. Let's keep reading. "For if while we were enemies," verse 10,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.440]   "we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more now, having been
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.400]   reconciled, shall we be saved by His life. More than that, we
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   also rejoice now in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.560]   saved from the wrath of God and saved for joy in God forevermore."
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.960]   One of the deepest needs every human soul has,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.600]   they do not know it, is to be happy in something bigger than
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.880]   anything this world can offer. Everybody knows they want to be happy.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.920]   Hardly anybody knows where it's to be found
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.840]   and what they're designed for and what that deep craving is all about
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.680]   in their hearts. And it's all about God. We try to fix it with money and sex and
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.280]   television and leisure and success, power, family, health,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   exercise, anything. And it's all about God. So this text says we're reconciled
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.760]   after the wrath is taken care of. Now we're reconciled in order that we
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.600]   might rejoice in God. There is one third
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   need. And I'll just go back to Matthew 1.21 that I quoted a minute ago.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.120]   "You will call His name Jesus because He will save His people from their
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   sin." Not simply the consequences of sin and wrath,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.880]   but the poison of sin and the distorting, contaminating, idolatrous,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.480]   ugliness of sin that ruins everything in life
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.320]   and makes me love stuff more than I love God. I need to be cleansed
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.720]   of all of that. Not just freed from its consequences.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.960]   I need the disease to be taken away, not just a rescue from the consequences of
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   its death and wrath. So those are the three
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.320]   things the gospel is designed to do. The gospel saves me from the wrath of
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.120]   God. The gospel cleanses me from the idolatrous, poisonous, all-distorting
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.480]   sin that makes me love other things more than God.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.880]   And the gospel opens access into, by reconciliation,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.360]   a sweet, deep, ever-increasing, all-satisfying
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.440]   joy in my Maker forever. There is not a word here about "save from
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   poverty." There is not a word about "save from
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.000]   sickness." Not a word about "save from terrorism."
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.480]   Not a word about "save from obscurity." Not a word about "save from rejection
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.840]   from men." Not a word about "save from having your
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.520]   daughter kidnapped and killed." Don't misunderstand me. I believe if
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.480]   you trust Jesus, many things in your lives
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:22.000]   go better. They just might not, because it's not guaranteed. That's not
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.920]   part of the gospel. Eventually, everything goes better.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.040]   New bodies, fellowship with Jesus, all sin taken away,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.560]   justice reigning in the earth, that's coming.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.480]   But between now and the coming of Jesus or our death,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   the gospel guarantees three things. My sin being progressively cleansed away,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.720]   my guilt and the wrath of God being totally taken away,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.080]   and an ever-increasing intimacy with God, my Father,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.840]   so that my soul is satisfied in Him when everything else around my soul
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.600]   gives way. So, are those three things felt as needs
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.400]   by American 21st century people? Not most of them. Most of them have God
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.160]   in their back pocket, not with flaming fire over their head in
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.600]   anger. Most of them love their sin, not hate it,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.920]   fear it, run from it. Most of them have plenty of delights,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.080]   but not in God. And they're not getting up and going to bed, seeking any solution
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.680]   to these three problems, which is why the preaching of the gospel is hard work.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.880]   It is impossible work. If my job were to meet felt needs,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.520]   I would not need the Holy Spirit. I know what your felt needs are, and I
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   can make you feel really good by stroking them. You all
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.960]   are vain. So, if I tell you that you look really
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   nice this morning, you'll like me, and you'll come back to
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.560]   this church and probably give. Everybody wants to be seen as smart and
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.080]   intelligent. So, if I tell you you're smart and intelligent,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   we'd grow a big church. It's easy to meet felt needs.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.880]   It takes no God, no Holy Spirit, no gospel. What's the hardest thing in the world is
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.400]   to wake the dead, open the eyes of the blind, give ears to
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.200]   the spiritually deaf, give legs of faith to the
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:48.880]   lame of unbelief. I can't do that. You wonder why I pray before I preach?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.680]   If God doesn't do something right now, I'm just
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.840]   batting my lips. Wow, that is a powerful excerpt from an old Pastor John sermon
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.400]   from 2003 titled, "If the root is holy, the branches
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.160]   are holy." I love that excerpt that the gospel saves
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.080]   me from the wrath of God. The gospel cleanses me from the
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.720]   idolatrous, poisonous, all-distorting sin that makes me love
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.520]   other things more than God. And the gospel opens access into, by
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.800]   reconciliation, a sweet, deep, ever-increasing, all-satisfying joy
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.000]   in my Maker forever. Amen. Christmas aims right at those three
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.120]   massive, unfelt needs, unfelt in the flesh,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   felt only by the grace of God. It's so good.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   Well, we are going to return on Christmas night, I think it is.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.680]   And, you know, the hymn "Joy to the World" has this line about
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.760]   preparing hymn room, you know, preparing for Christ to enter
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.880]   into our lives. So what does it mean to receive Jesus Christ?
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.960]   That is a very fitting question for Christmas night,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.880]   and that's when we return on the podcast. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.680]   We'll see you then.
