[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   the first decade of my preaching ministry I prepared all of my
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.960]   sermons in King James text simply because it was too much
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.280]   work if I wanted to preach this sermon somewhere that demanded
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.520]   King James only.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.600]   There are some downsides to that because there are archaic
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.440]   expressions in the King James that don't communicate so you
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.120]   have to take care to explain those things.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.680]   Words that have changed meaning since 1611, those things all
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.120]   need to be explained so it was a little more work to preach
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   actually, from the King James.
