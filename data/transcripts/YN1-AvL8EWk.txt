[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.640]   Now I get to introduce someone who needs no introduction,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.920]   which is why I'll do it anyways.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.720]   Rick Ferry is the founder of Ferry Investment Solutions LLC,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   an investment advisor firm that also charges by the hour,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.160]   copying my model.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.600]   He has been in the investment industry
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.040]   for more than 35 years.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.560]   Rick has coauthored six books on index fund investing,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.680]   exchange traded funds, asset allocation,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.240]   and other personal finance topics.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.060]   He is the host of the Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.280]   Rick has his degree from, should I change the college?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.540]   University of Rhode Island, that RI stands for Rhode Island.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.800]   College of Business earned a master's degree
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.960]   from Walsh College in Michigan and is a CFA charter holder.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   If that wasn't enough, prior to earning the biz,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.600]   Rick flew fighter aircraft in the Marine Corps
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.640]   and is a retired Marine Corps officer.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.480]   Yes, sir.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.400]   - Thank you, Mr. Roth.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.760]   All right, thank you, Alan.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.560]   We're gonna see Alan again in a couple of minutes.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.920]   So this part of the discussion
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360]   is called Building Your Portfolio.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   Okay, I have a kind of a unique way of talking about this.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320]   And here is my Venn diagram of what is actually going on
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.160]   when you are going to put together an investment portfolio.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   Before, this puts it all in perspective
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.880]   of the three key things you need to do
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   in order to be a successful investor.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   And it really, quite frankly,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.380]   doesn't matter if you're talking about real estate
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380]   or index funds, or even active management,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.400]   you need these three elements.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   So you need a philosophy of what you're going to do
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.280]   and how you're going to do it and why.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.420]   Then you need a strategy,
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.520]   which is the nuts and bolts of your portfolio.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.760]   And then you need the discipline
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.960]   to put it together and maintain it.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.100]   So the Bogleheads, the reason we're all here
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.380]   is because we all have the same philosophy.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.480]   We all have the same philosophy.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.120]   And here's some bullet points you can get right off
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600]   of bogleheads.org, the Bogle Center,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.220]   about what the Bogleheads investment philosophy is.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.960]   That is, as Alan already pointed out,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.480]   invest with simplicity.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.640]   This isn't hard.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   And don't make it hard.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.140]   I mean, Wall Street does want to make it hard
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.620]   because complexity is job security
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.440]   in the investment world.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.160]   The more complex they can make things,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.220]   the more money they make.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.980]   You shouldn't be thinking that way.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.840]   Investing is simple, so invest with simplicity.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.860]   Minimize cost, including taxes.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.260]   Keep your cost as low as possible
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.740]   'cause everything that comes out of your pocket
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.860]   to pay for cost and for taxes
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.300]   is less money that you have.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.640]   As Alan mentioned, use index funds when possible
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   because in the long term, it's extremely difficult
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.040]   to outperform the markets
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.360]   if you're trying to beat the markets.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.800]   And if you're trying to do this in bonds and stocks,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.920]   U.S. stocks and foreign stocks,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.160]   each one of these categories,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.720]   if all you did was use index funds
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.920]   in each one of these categories,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.760]   probability is over 90 some odd percent
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.540]   that you're gonna outperform anything else that you do
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.080]   just by using all index funds in every asset class.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.440]   So you should use them whenever you can.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.080]   Now, you might be in a 401(k) or 403(b)
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.720]   where they don't have index funds and that's unfortunate.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   You have to use what they have.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.400]   And then finally, as Alan pointed out,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.000]   once you're invested in these markets,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.480]   you don't try to time the markets.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.000]   We don't know what's gonna happen next.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.120]   Now, a lot of people out there make believe they do
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.920]   and they make a lot of money by making believe
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.140]   they know what's gonna happen next in the markets.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.860]   Well, we don't at the Bogleheads.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.740]   We just take an allocation to our stocks and bonds
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.720]   and cash, as you'll see in a minute,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   and then hold it like Jack Bogle said.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.500]   Don't do something, just stand there.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.320]   By the way, that complete list of what is a Boglehead
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.140]   and our philosophy is on the wiki, Bogleheads wiki,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.540]   which we have in the website, bogleheads.org.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.820]   And you can also find it on boglecenter.net.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.340]   Okay, now what's the difference
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.340]   between the philosophy and strategy?
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.840]   And here's the way I describe this.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.100]   If you believe that you're already a Boglehead
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.900]   or that you wanna be a Boglehead,
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.680]   or that if you are at a Bogleheads conference
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.620]   or would go to a Bogleheads conference,
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.340]   in other words, you wanna embrace
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.860]   this Bogleheads philosophy,
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.520]   if that's you, raise your hand.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.460]   That's about, hopefully, everybody in this room.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.220]   Other than that, Goldman Sachs
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.860]   has a conference down the hall.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.260]   Sell you whatever you want.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.100]   Okay, so everybody has the same philosophy.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.620]   I mean, we do believe in this.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.780]   We do believe this is in our best interest.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.540]   That's philosophy.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.220]   Now, how many people in this room
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.340]   have the exact same portfolio,
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.300]   the exact same allocation to the exact same funds
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.660]   as someone else in this room?
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.220]   Exactly, same amount in cash,
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.440]   maybe same amount in CDs, percentage.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.520]   Raise your hand.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.060]   Nobody, why?
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.060]   Because we're all different.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.620]   We're all unique.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.980]   We all have different situations.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.420]   I'm older, you're younger.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.300]   I'm still working.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.700]   Alan doesn't need to work anymore.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.960]   He hasn't needed to work for years.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.920]   Anyway, you'll hear this rivalry, by the way,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.400]   between Alan and I going back for the whole entire weekend,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.500]   so just get used to it.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.360]   But anyway, the point is that we are all different.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.720]   We have different circumstances,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.500]   different family needs, different taxes,
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.300]   different incomes, different savings, different everything.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.140]   Different investments available to us
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.540]   in our 401(k)s, 403(b).
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.140]   I mean, it's different.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.540]   So what is strategy?
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.540]   Strategy is how you put your portfolio together
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.620]   based on what you have available
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.680]   and what your needs are and what your situation is.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.740]   So while the philosophy covers this entire conference,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.020]   we're all on board with the Bogleheads philosophy.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   How you do it is going to be uniquely different
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.260]   in some way than how anybody else does it, and that's okay.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.000]   I wanna state right from the beginning,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.860]   there is no right way or wrong way.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.300]   You're going to have your own way,
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.560]   and that's perfectly fine, and that is strategy.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.500]   So strategy is what is your asset allocation
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   between cash, bonds, stocks, maybe real estate?
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   And then asset location, which is,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.580]   something having to do with taxes,
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.260]   where some things work better
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.520]   in a pre-tax retirement account, like a 401(k),
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.380]   and other things work better, say,
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.300]   in a tax-free account, like a Roth account.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.980]   I'm not talking about Alan, but a Roth account.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.700]   By the way, did you know that person
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.860]   who created the Roth account?
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.800]   Was he a relative?
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.880]   Michael William Roth, okay.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.500]   Did he go to the University of Colorado also?
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.860]   (laughs)
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.620]   All right, so, and then last is the investment selection.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.340]   So you have your asset allocation
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.040]   between stocks, bonds, cash, real estate,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.220]   and then you have where you're gonna put it,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.860]   what type of accounts you're gonna put this in
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.780]   based on taxes, and then finally,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.320]   what are the actual investments you're going to use?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.240]   And again, sometimes you're restricted,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.380]   like you're in a 401(k),
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.180]   so these are the only funds you have available to you.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.700]   Okay, so those, that's the investment selection portion.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.540]   One, two, three.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.860]   Last is discipline.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.180]   So once you come up, you have the philosophy,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.580]   you come up with your asset allocation strategy,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.100]   your asset location strategy, you've got your investments,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.480]   you're satisfied with everything.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.820]   Discipline is the last leg.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.220]   You have to do it, you have to get it implemented fully.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.820]   I mean, a lot of people come up with strategy,
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.260]   they just never get it done.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.940]   They just never actually implement it.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.180]   So you have to implement it fully,
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.880]   and then you have to regularly maintain it.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.640]   For instance, if you wanna have an allocation
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.260]   that's half in stocks and half in bonds,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.340]   well, it's maybe once a year you have to look at it
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.180]   and decide, okay, I need to maybe sell a little bit of stock
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.060]   in my 401(k) and buy a little bit of more bonds
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.820]   to keep it at 50/50, because the stock market went up.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.220]   And then a periodic review of where are you going.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.140]   In other words, you might be transitioning
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.300]   from working to retirement,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.340]   so maybe you wanna make a change to your asset allocation,
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.380]   or maybe a change to your asset location,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.300]   some change to strategy based on where you are in life.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.460]   So that's discipline.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.620]   So philosophy, overriding everything,
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.260]   strategy based on what it is you're going to do
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.720]   to keep it as simple as possible,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.220]   and then you have to implement it and maintain it.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.620]   And so asset allocation is really simple, right?
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.500]   It's stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.940]   How much should you have in each one of these?
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.140]   And the answer is, I don't know.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.020]   And as strange as it seems,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.300]   if you were talking with me and you said to me,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.820]   "Rick, how much do you think I should have
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.980]   "in stocks and bonds and real estate and cash?"
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.000]   And I would say, "I don't know, Alan.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.260]   "How much do you think you should have
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.420]   "in stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash?"
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.100]   Because you've already thought about it.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.060]   You've already thought about it.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.740]   You say, "Well, I think that I'm pretty good
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.620]   "with maybe, oh, 50% in stocks
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.080]   "and maybe 30% in bonds, 10% say in cash,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.100]   "and then I want to probably put 10% in real estate."
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.580]   I said, "Okay, is that something you're able to maintain
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.420]   "if you did it?"
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.500]   And Alan says, "Yes, that is."
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.880]   And I say, "Well, that sounds like it's a good strategy
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.020]   "to me."
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.340]   Honestly, in the end, you have to run your own portfolio.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.660]   That asset allocation is your asset allocation,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.560]   and you have to stick with it with discipline.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.360]   So I can't answer for you what your asset allocation should be.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.940]   All I can do is help you confirm within your own mind,
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.780]   because in the end,
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.140]   it's you sticking with that asset allocation,
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.220]   which is going to drive 90% of your return
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.320]   in the very long term.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.020]   So whether you should be high in stocks or low in stocks
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.060]   really doesn't have a lot to do,
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.660]   believe it or not, with your age.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.820]   I have people who I've talked with who are in their 80s.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.980]   They have no bonds, 100% stock.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.920]   And I have people who I talked with
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.320]   who may have sold a company in their early 30s.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.840]   They don't want stock.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.280]   They just want bonds.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   Now, I try to talk them into a little bit of stock
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   for inflation purposes,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.020]   but my point is that there are these rules of thumb out there
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.680]   that you should probably ignore,
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.400]   like your age and bonds and this and that.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.080]   Okay, if you have nothing else to go on,
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.600]   that's not a bad place to start.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.360]   But in reality, because we're Bogleheads,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.540]   we can give it a little bit more thought than that
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.060]   and say, okay, well, what is it that I need
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.900]   for the long term?
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.180]   What's my horizon?
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.500]   Is the money gonna go to the kids when I die?
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.420]   Is that what I want?
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.780]   What's my goal?
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.620]   A lot of the things Jesse was talking about.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.100]   So you gotta come up with
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.940]   what's an appropriate asset allocation.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.960]   But the most important thing,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.140]   the most important thing on your asset allocation
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.340]   is staying the course, whatever it is.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.260]   If you decide to be 80% in stocks,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.280]   no matter what, you're gonna be 80% in stocks.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.440]   The market goes down, you make yourself 80% in stock again.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.000]   If the market goes way up,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.380]   you might take a little bit off the table.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.200]   Keeping your asset allocation is the most important thing
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.680]   that you do as far as maintaining your portfolio.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   You have to be comfortable with your asset allocation
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.000]   enough to stick with it during all market conditions.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.880]   So what about your investments?
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.480]   Alan already talked about this,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.340]   and I'm gonna hit it one more time.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.920]   If you can, a simple portfolio is going to consist of
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.440]   probably some money market funds
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.880]   or some treasury bills for your cash reserve.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.780]   Now a cash reserve, in my opinion,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.120]   is probably more of a dollar amount than a percentage.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.640]   So you maybe need one year's worth of living expenses,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.000]   or maybe you need $100,000.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.560]   You have your cash reserve,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   and it's usually not so much a percentage
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.920]   as it is a dollar amount.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.260]   The next thing is, how much do you want in bonds
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.100]   or fixed income?
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.100]   By the way, it doesn't have to be bonds.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.260]   If you wanna do a laddered portfolio
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.660]   or certificates of deposit, that's perfectly fine.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.740]   That's a fixed income, that's a bond.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.500]   If you wanna buy individual treasury bonds
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.760]   or treasury inflation protected securities,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.420]   that's perfectly fine.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.140]   If you wanna do a simple thing and buy a bond index fund,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.540]   that's perfectly fine.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.420]   But the next level is,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.180]   how much are you going to have in bonds?
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.620]   And as I said, some people don't have any bonds,
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.320]   and that's perfectly fine if that works for you.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.300]   And the next thing we get into is stock,
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.380]   and here, as Alan pointed out,
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.380]   really, I believe a U.S. stock market fund is perfect.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.480]   Covers all the stocks in the United States.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.940]   You don't need anything more.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.900]   You're gonna do just fine.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.700]   And the fees are very low,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.660]   and they work great, by the way, in a taxable account
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.820]   because the dividends are low.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.820]   International stocks, again, a total international fund.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.780]   Now, these are all the stocks
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.220]   that are outside the United States,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.060]   and there's more of them
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.540]   than there are stocks in the United States.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.300]   Little bit of a diversification benefit
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.860]   because they're not traded in the U.S. dollars.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.860]   They're traded in foreign,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.240]   whatever the native currencies are.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.260]   Now, when you buy 'em in a fund,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.360]   you don't have to worry about any of this,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.020]   but you get some diversification away from the U.S. dollar.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.260]   And in addition to that,
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.060]   if you look at the underlying industry groups
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.980]   that make up the international market,
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.180]   they are different than the U.S. market.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.300]   The U.S. market is very heavy tech.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.700]   Outside the U.S., it's more materials,
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.420]   industrials, energy, things like that.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.340]   So you can get some industry diversification
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.480]   by being an international.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.620]   But just buy an index fund.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.780]   Total stock market index fund.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.140]   Now, in your 401(k), you can even make it easier,
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.140]   or if you have an IRA,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.280]   you could buy something called a balanced fund
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.900]   or a target retirement fund, which is a balanced fund.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.180]   And all they are is simply,
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.720]   if you're using an index fund,
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.420]   like a balanced index fund
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.020]   or a target retirement index fund,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.500]   the mix is already there for you.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.780]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.060]   You just look under the hood and say,
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.140]   okay, what's the percentage in stocks and bonds
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.720]   in this balanced fund?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.880]   And is that what you want?
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.060]   Well, then you buy that fund.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.540]   They're very inexpensive.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.900]   Say something like a Vanguard target retirement fund
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.580]   or an iShare target retirement fund.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   Fidelity also has target retirement index funds
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.480]   is what you're looking for.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.300]   Very low cost.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.320]   So that makes it really, really simple
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.260]   in your retirement account.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   Now, it may not work so well in your taxable account
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.300]   because these things do have a tendency
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.820]   to spin off sometimes some taxes.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.220]   So maybe you wanna do it a little different
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.660]   in your taxable account,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.180]   which gets me to the last thing.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.220]   And we're gonna have a session on this at the end.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.300]   Taxes.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.860]   And this is where the asset location idea comes in.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.260]   If you're working and your taxes are high,
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.940]   you're paying a lot of money to the government every year,
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.420]   you probably don't wanna be generating
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.680]   a lot of taxable income in your taxable account.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.160]   So what you might wanna do is put in your taxable account
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.880]   things like the US total stock market,
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.100]   whereas maybe your international fund,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.860]   you would put into your Roth account,
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.580]   which has a much higher dividend than US stocks,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.780]   or the bonds you're gonna put into your retirement account.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.780]   So it's called asset location.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.700]   So in other words, you know what your asset allocation is
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.300]   between stocks, bonds, and cash.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.980]   Question is, where are you gonna put the stocks?
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.380]   Where are you gonna put the US stocks?
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.400]   Where are you gonna put the international stocks?
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.860]   What if you bought some real estate,
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.460]   where would you put that?
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.660]   And if you had bonds, where would you put that?
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.340]   And a lot of this is driven by taxes.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.820]   So you've got these different buckets,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.020]   these different types of accounts.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.020]   Tax-deferred, like a 401(k), IRA, 403(b), 457.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.940]   Tax-free is your Roth, HSA, and even 529 plans.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.500]   And then you've got your taxable account.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.480]   So again, where you put these individual investments,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.860]   a lot of times can be driven by taxes.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.980]   And so it's called asset location.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.480]   And you can save a lot of money if you do it well.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.140]   So then finally, maintain your portfolio.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.220]   Again, you're gonna have to implement it fully.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.460]   Once you've got your plan, implement it fully.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.380]   Automate whenever you can.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.740]   Like I told you earlier, automate, automate,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.060]   automate, automate, automate.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.700]   So you don't have to think about this, it's already done.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.300]   Have the 401(k) money, go directly out of your paycheck,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.380]   which it will, go right into the account
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.900]   that you wanted into the fund you wanted into,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.540]   which it will, automate everything.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.860]   Rebalance occasionally, maybe once a year.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.900]   There's no rocket science to when you should get it back
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.860]   to your mix between stocks and bonds.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.100]   Once a year is probably fine.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.540]   And tax-managed, because taxes are an expense.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.380]   And finally, reaffirm periodically.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.580]   What do I mean by reaffirm?
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.380]   Come to another Bogleheads meeting, once a year.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.620]   Reaffirm all of this.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.860]   A lot of people have been coming for a long,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.380]   to these meetings for a long, long, long time.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.820]   And a lot of it is reaffirming what they already know,
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.300]   but they still come.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.260]   How many people have been to
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.380]   more than one Boglehead meeting already?
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.180]   Yeah, I think if we go to the other room next door,
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.060]   there's gonna even be more.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.340]   So the bottom line is, it's just reaffirming,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.860]   validating what you're doing.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.420]   And that's good, that's just reaffirm periodically.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.780]   And of course, stay the course.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.340]   Once you've got your strategy,
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.020]   and once you've got the philosophy,
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.820]   you've got your strategy, you've got your discipline,
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.700]   stay the course.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.140]   That was the name of Jack Bogle's last book.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.500]   Great book, by the way, if you get a chance.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.900]   It's kind of his whole life all wrapped up into one book.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.780]   Thank you, and now I'm gonna ask Alan to come back up.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:20.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
