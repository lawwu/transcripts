[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 8 and verse 12.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.560]   In the twelfth verse in the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, "Then
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:25.720]   spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.960]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.080]   We come back for the fourth time to a consideration of this great and mighty statement which is
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.480]   recorded here in this one verse.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.880]   It is, as I've been saying, a kind of summary of the message of the Christian faith, the
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120]   Christian Gospel.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.400]   And I'm calling attention to it quite deliberately for this reason, that if I understand the
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.760]   times in which we are living at all, their main and chief characteristic is confusion.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.480]   There's confusion about everything.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.080]   It's obvious in the international realm, isn't it?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960]   It's obvious on the national level.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.300]   It's obvious in the realm of philosophy.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.880]   It's tragically obvious in the realm of morals.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.400]   But alas, and most serious of all, there is confusion even in the church of God.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   There is uncertainty and confusion as to the meaning of the very word "Christian."
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.760]   Everything seems to be in a state of flux.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.240]   And therefore I suggest that our first business at such a time as this is to come back to
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.480]   the foundations and to know exactly what the Christian faith is.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.240]   There is so much talk at the present time about the application of the Gospel to this,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.840]   that, and the other, and the Christian attitude, and the Christian point of view.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   But before we begin to do anything of the kind, we surely should know what we mean by
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   the term "Christian."
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.600]   It's no use talking about the Christian attitude if you don't know what a Christian is, or
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   what makes a man a Christian.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.960]   The danger confronting us today is the danger of missing the wood because of the trees.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   And therefore we come back and we look at a great statement like this.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.720]   Haven't you noticed how so constantly in the New Testament you get these summaries
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   of the whole Gospel?
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Our Lord did it himself.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   John 3, 16, this one, many others.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.000]   And you find the apostolic writers are very fond of doing the same thing.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.080]   There were several instances of it in that fifth chapter of the second epistle to the
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   Corinthians that we read at the beginning.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.280]   In other words, it has always been clear that it is very essential that we should be reminded
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.360]   of the centralities, the foundational things.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.280]   Because once we leave the foundation, we really have nothing at all.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.240]   Well now, here it is, I say, in one great verse, and we've been looking at it.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.620]   The thing that we are struck with at once, of course, is this, that our Lord calls attention
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.620]   to himself.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.320]   "I," he says, he's talking about himself, he's not talking about a point of view, he's
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.800]   not talking about a teaching, it's he.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.160]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   He isn't, says, "I've come to give you a little light on the human situation."
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   No, no.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.320]   What he says is, "I am the light."
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   The person of the Lord is essential, it's vital.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.440]   There is no Christianity without Christ.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.360]   That's the trouble today, that people are talking about Christendom and Christianity.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   There is no such thing apart from Christ himself.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.240]   The first thing here is not a teaching, it's a person.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.120]   And then we've seen the uniqueness of his claim.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.680]   It's an exclusive claim.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.920]   "I," he says, and he means "I" and "I" alone.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.720]   "Am the light of the world."
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.920]   He doesn't need any help, doesn't need any assistance.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.040]   There is no second, there is nothing additional.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.440]   There is no need for Christianity to seek further insights from other religions.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.720]   This is the only true revelation of God.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.280]   "Ah, but there's somebody that's intolerant."
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.400]   Well, Christianity is intolerant.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.520]   Have you ever read anything more intolerant than this text?
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.000]   "I," says this man who appeared to be just an ordinary Jew and a carpenter at that,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.600]   not even a Pharisee, he stands up and says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   He excludes everybody and everything else.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.960]   It is an exclusive claim.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.160]   And Christianity is exclusive.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   It is intolerant.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.480]   "Though we are an angel from heaven," says the Apostle Paul to the Galatians, "preach
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.760]   any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached, let him be accursed."
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.240]   He doesn't care even if it is an angel preaching another message, let him be accursed.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   There is but one gospel and there is no other.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.200]   Very well, what does it tell us?
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.400]   What is this light that we find and see in Christ?
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.800]   Well, I've pointed out to you that it is light upon the whole world situation and about
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.200]   the future of the world.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.280]   We've dealt with it.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.200]   But thank God we notice this little word here, "he."
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.400]   "I am the light of the world, he that followeth me."
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.520]   The New Testament doesn't hold out any hope for this world.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.440]   I go on saying that every Sunday night, don't I?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.480]   Perhaps some of you are more ready to agree with me tonight than you were even a week
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   tonight.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.800]   Summit conferences collapse, you see.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   You still feel there's hope for this world?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   The New Testament says there's none.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.840]   It's a doomed world, it's a condemned world, it's a sinful world.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   The New Testament doesn't set out to reform this world.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.920]   It says it cannot be reformed.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.600]   It's under judgment, it's going to be destroyed.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.520]   And there will be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.360]   So we don't waste our time in trying to reform the world, it can't be done.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.800]   There are temporary changes and improvements, I'm not here to denounce them.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.920]   Thank God for them.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.520]   It is the business of all of us to make this world as good a place as we can.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   That's a very different thing from saying that the world can be delivered and made perfect
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.200]   or reformed.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   It cannot.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.480]   You can restrain evil and sin up to a point, it's our duty to do so.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.240]   But beyond that we cannot go and nobody ever will go.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.160]   That's the plain New Testament teaching.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.920]   But thank God, I say, though that is the position of the truth concerning the world, there is
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.200]   hope for the individual.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.120]   He that followeth me.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.680]   This gospel is primarily for the individual, it's a personal message.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   And surely we all are to rejoice in that fact at a time such as this.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.520]   I am amazed that anybody could object to the fact that the gospel is personal.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.760]   Can't you see, my friend, that this is your only hope at the present time?
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.080]   That though the world itself is in such a hopeless condition and will get worse and
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   worse, you are not of necessity, inexplicably involved in that you can be delivered out
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   of it.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.920]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.880]   It is, as Paul puts it again in writing to the Galatians at the very beginning, that
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.160]   we can be delivered from this present evil world, we can be saved out of the world.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.120]   John Bunyan's pilgrim's progress, isn't it?
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.800]   You can go out of the city of destruction and you can be saved and your future can be
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   secure.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.400]   Now then, the question is, how does that happen?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:26.600]   Well we've seen that our Lord's first answer to that is that we need to know God.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   All the trouble in the world tonight is due to its ignorance of God.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   You remember how our Lord in his high priestly prayer at the end of his life said, "O righteous
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:43.120]   Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   thou hast sent me."
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.760]   That is the trouble with the world, it doesn't know God.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   Of course it doesn't realize that, it doesn't realize that that's the cause of its ills,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   but it is.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   That's the message of this whole book.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.040]   The world doesn't know God, it doesn't know anything about him.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.800]   And hence all its problems and its difficulties, all its disobedience and its sin and its rebellion,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.160]   and all the consequences that flow from that.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.000]   So there is the first and the great need, and you'll never know God except in Jesus
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Christ.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.200]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.040]   Again you see it's exclusive.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.360]   You cannot know God except in and through this blessed person.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.200]   But we've also seen that he and he alone gives us light with regard to ourselves.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.720]   And here again we are woefully ignorant, we are in darkness.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   All the modern views of men which are optimistic and which praise him, and which think that
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.520]   by appealing to him and giving him a little knowledge and education you can solve his
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.560]   problems, you know it's to me almost incredible that with the world as it is tonight that
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.520]   people can still go on saying that.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.680]   That is their basic philosophy, that man is essentially good, and that all he needs is
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.800]   knowledge and information, all he needs is to appeal to his better instincts and he'll
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.680]   rise up and respond to it.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.480]   Well obviously I say the newspapers are telling us that he doesn't do so, and that increasingly
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.040]   he isn't doing so.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.640]   No, no, man is born in sin, he's evil.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.320]   All the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart were evil altogether.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.040]   Man is made in sin.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   Sin is within him, it's in the very warp and woof of his nature.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.640]   We're all polluted.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.760]   Men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.160]   Very well, there he is, there is God and here is man, and Christ alone gives us light in
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   these matters.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.960]   Well, very well, what does all this amount to?
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:06.200]   Well it amounts to this, that man's troubles, therefore, all are due to his condition and
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.600]   to his wrong relationship to God.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.800]   What then is man's supreme need?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.160]   Now that's the question that's before us.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:24.040]   What is it that man needs primarily this evening?
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.200]   Now here again is the light which we get alone from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   That's obvious, isn't it?
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.600]   You go and ask the average man, "What do we need tonight?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.080]   What is man's first and most essential need?"
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.440]   And I think you'll find that most people will say that man's first and most essential need
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.840]   is world peace.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.400]   World peace.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.200]   The idea seems to be that if only somehow or another we could get these nations and
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.120]   statesmen to agree and abolish their armaments and sign pacts and decide never to have war
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   again, that all would be well.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.120]   World peace.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.960]   That's the big thing, that's what everybody's talking about.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.840]   All the interest and the excitement is rounded about that.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.080]   And it is expected of the Christian Church that she should be the primary agency in producing
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.560]   world peace.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.000]   And that the message of Christianity is, of course, a message that is designed to abolish
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   war and to usher in this age of peace.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.760]   That that is the primary task and business of Christian preaching.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:38.960]   Well, I don't know how you feel, my friend, but you know I'm feeling rather happy in this
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.920]   pulpit tonight, that I didn't spend my time last Sunday evening in this pulpit in giving
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.400]   advice to the leaders of the nations as to what they should say and do at the summit
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.160]   conference.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.920]   Because if I'd done that, I'd have been wasting my breath and your time, wouldn't I?
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.560]   There wasn't a conference.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.920]   It never began even.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.680]   And if I'd spent my time there for you in telling the statesmen what to do and what
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.880]   to say and what not to do, I say I've been wasting my breath and wasting my time and
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   yours.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   No, no, that's not the message of the gospel.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   Well, what is it?
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.560]   Well, as I'm saying, the message of this gospel is, this is the thing that the Lord Jesus
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.360]   Christ, this person who stands and says, "I am the light of the world," what he says is
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   this.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:35.200]   Man's first need, man's most essential need, man's central need, is to be reconciled to
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.960]   God.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.840]   You cannot abolish war.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.440]   It will never be abolished.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.080]   It will never be abolished, I mean, until this final judgment and the return of Christ
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.480]   and the final punishment and destruction of evil and sin.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.480]   Then there will be universal peace, but not until then.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.280]   There is no hope in the meantime.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:04.800]   Very well then, I say, man's supreme need is this, is to be reconciled to God.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.640]   And my dear friend, can't you see that it is your most urgent need?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.000]   Are you still thinking in terms of the world and what's going to happen to the world?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.840]   Well, aren't you somewhat disapposed by now?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.640]   Aren't you beginning to see that all your hopes are being falsified and the prophecies
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.640]   are falling to the ground round and about you?
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.440]   Isn't it beginning to occur to you that this is your problem?
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.600]   Very well, here am I in this world, I'm getting older day by day, I may die at any moment.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.720]   The problem for me is this, how not to abolish war, but what can I do about my own eternal
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   destiny?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.320]   Whether I go out of this world as the result of a bomb or a war or not, whether I die a
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.040]   natural death or whether I die as the result of some infection, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:54.240]   What matters to me is not how I'm going to die, but the fact that I'm going to die.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.020]   And the more uncertain the world becomes, the more urgent this problem surely should
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.760]   become for every one of us.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.200]   I can't solve the problem of world peace, nobody else can.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.360]   I'm telling you that it'll never be solved.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.640]   Very well, my friend, forget that and realize that your business is this, where do you come
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.360]   in, how do you stand?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.880]   What's going to happen to you when you die?
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.720]   Now that's the thing the gospel is concerned about.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   He that followeth me.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.160]   Here is one, you see, who indulges in paradox.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.960]   He's the light of the world, then he immediately talks about the individual.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.400]   That is precisely the gospel.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.360]   Men supreme, I say men's first need is to be reconciled to God.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.840]   You know your greatest need tonight is not to be happy.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.600]   It's not to get rid of this or that that's causing you some difficulty.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:51.640]   Your primary need is to be forgiven, is to be reconciled to God, for we're all sinners
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   before God.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   Our natures are sinful.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.920]   We are committing acts of sin constantly.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.960]   We've done so ever we began acting.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   We are all sinners in the sight of God and under condemnation.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.120]   That's our first need.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.920]   The second follows, of course, to know to discover how to live while we are left in
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.800]   this world in a worthy and in a good and a right manner.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.520]   But you notice the order in which I put them.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.880]   Your first need and mine is not how to live.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:30.960]   Your first need before we proceed a single step is how to be reconciled to God.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.440]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.840]   You don't start by saying, "How can I live the Christian life?"
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:41.520]   No, no, before you do anything you need to be reconciled to God, you need to be forgiven.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.800]   The problem of how to live is not the first problem.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.720]   And that is not the primary thing that is emphasized by the Son of God everywhere in
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.360]   his teaching and by these apostles whom he commissioned to go out to teach and to preach.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:02.040]   The first thing, the thing that is being so sadly forgotten today, is a man's relationship
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   to God.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.320]   Job has put the first question first.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.560]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.480]   You know, this is the first thing that our law deals with.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.640]   This is the thing that really makes a man a Christian.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.920]   Why am I emphasizing this?
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.320]   Well I'm emphasizing it because I've read a thing like this these last few days.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.000]   "What does it mean to be a Christian?"
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.360]   writes this man.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.480]   "Is it a matter of belief or of behavior?
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.760]   Does it consist in knowing the right answers, possessing the proper gifts, belonging to
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.080]   the true body of believers?"
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.520]   And he answers, "None of these, nor all of them together as I conceive it, makes a
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.120]   man a Christian."
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:55.520]   A Christian is one who loves Christ and who, trusting entirely to his enabling grace, seeks
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.560]   to walk in his way.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.800]   Now that sounds very wonderful, doesn't it?
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   But it's left out the most important thing.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   It's left out the first thing.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:14.280]   A Christian is first and foremost and essentially a man who is concerned about the question
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.320]   of his relationship to God.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.400]   The first thing a man who is convicted by the Spirit of God and of Christ, the first
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:30.820]   question such a man faces is, not how can I live a good life, but what about my sins?
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.760]   What about my past sins?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.720]   What about my evil nature?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.680]   What about my reconciliation to God, my whole relationship to God?
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   How can I find God?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.440]   How can I be just with God?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.200]   That's the first question.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.360]   But there is so much, you see, that in the name of Christianity today doesn't even mention
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.840]   that, doesn't even raise the question.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.640]   It thinks of Christianity entirely in terms of conduct and of behavior.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.020]   You look at Christ, you see he is wonderful, you want to follow him, and you believe that
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.400]   he can enable you to live as he lived.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.440]   But my dear friend, before you move a step, I say, you've got to face this question.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.360]   There is your record, there is your past, there is what you've done, and here is this
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.200]   holy God.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.120]   You need to be forgiven.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:22.300]   The first problem is the problem of forgiveness, not of life and living.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.000]   And that is the light that our Lord casts upon this matter, and that's the thing that
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.560]   I want to unfold to you now this evening.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.400]   Here, I say, then, is the first need.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.040]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.960]   Man is as he is, I say, because he is estranged from God.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.720]   He is not being blessed by God.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.440]   God withholds his blessings from him.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.800]   God hearth not sinners.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.560]   And God's displeasure is patently upon the world in which you and I are living at this
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.360]   present hour.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.640]   So that what man needs above everything is to know God and to have fellowship and communion
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:09.880]   with him, that he may ask him for his blessing and receive it.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.320]   It's this terrible barrier between man and God.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.640]   That's the first thing.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.200]   How is that to be removed?
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.160]   How can the problem of our sin and our guilt be dealt with?
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.540]   My dear friend, if you don't start there, anything you may say is of no value.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.800]   It's no use talking about loving Christ if you don't know what you're loving him for.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   Why should you love Christ?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.120]   What is it to love Christ?
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.240]   You see, these people, they don't like definitions, they say.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   They don't like theology.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   They don't like doctrine.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.680]   Ah, they say, "You mustn't talk about it.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.800]   It's none of these things.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.480]   It's just loving Christ."
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.080]   But you know why you love a person, don't you?
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   You must have some reason.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.400]   Who is Christ?
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   Why should I love him?
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.520]   What's he done that I should love him?
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.680]   And the moment you ask those questions, you're asking for definitions.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:05.040]   And thank God, unlike this supposed Christianity today, this blessed person answers the questions.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.800]   He does give light, and it's very clear and it's very specific.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.360]   And his apostles who wrote after him, they define it.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.700]   They state exactly what it is and what it isn't.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.920]   You know, this book is full of argumentation.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.720]   It's full of denunciation of error.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   It's full of proclamation of truth.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.900]   And that is Christianity.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:28.520]   Not some vague, nebulous, indefinite, sentimental talk about loving Christ and trying to follow
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   him.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   No, no.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.980]   My first need is, "What can be done with my sin?"
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.000]   And the answer is that Christ and Christ alone gives me light upon this.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.420]   Because every other view about this is quite wrong.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:51.880]   What the other views are saying can be summarized in this way.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.680]   They tell us that all we've got to do is to tell God that we are sorry.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.920]   To go and tell him that we know we've done certain things that we shouldn't, but that
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.400]   now we've seen how wrong it was, and we're going to live a better life.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.560]   We're going to follow Christ, this great exemplar for young people, this great hero for the
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   young.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.840]   We're going to set out after this great estate, this moral exemplar, and we're going to follow
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.120]   him, come and we work ourselves up into a great pitch of eloquence as we talk about
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.820]   admiring and following Christ.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.320]   And we're going to do a lot of good.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.240]   We're going to be benefactors.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.360]   We're going to enter some great moral crusade.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   We're going to clear the world up.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.560]   We're going to put everything right.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.320]   We're going to solve all the problems.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.160]   We are going to do it all.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   Where does God come in?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.320]   Well, they say God is love and God will forgive you.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.480]   If you just tell God you're sorry, well, you can be quite sure that God forgives you, because
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.960]   God is love and there's no more to it.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.080]   That's the popular notion, isn't it?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.880]   You just say you're sorry, you pledge yourself to live a good and a better life and to do
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:12.080]   good and to be a philanthropist, and you've got noble ideals and high views, and God will
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.240]   forgive you and will be pleased with you and will smile upon you.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   That's the teaching.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.480]   Well, all I ask is this.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:27.080]   If that is all that is necessary, why in the name of God did this person called Jesus Christ
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.960]   of Nazareth ever come into this world?
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:40.400]   Because he tells us here that he and he alone can give us light on this question.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:48.560]   And what he tells us at once, of course, is that all this other notion is entirely wrong,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.680]   that he is absolutely vital and central and essential to forgiveness and to reconciliation
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.960]   with God.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.240]   Why is all this other wrong?
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.580]   Why isn't it just enough that a man should say that he's sorry and promised to live this
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.840]   better life and then God's love will forgive him?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   Why?
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.960]   The answer is this, according to our Lord, "God seeth the heart."
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.760]   God doesn't merely see our external actions, he sees the heart.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:25.880]   "Ye are they," he said to the Pharisees, "that justify yourselves before men."
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.280]   Of course, they only see the outside.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.320]   But God seeth the heart, for that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.400]   in the sight of God.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.160]   You know, that Pharisee that went up into the temple to pray would have impressed men
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   very much.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.040]   He did fast twice in the week, he did give a tenth of his goods to the poor, he was a
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.580]   very good and moral and religious man.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.640]   But Christ says that he went back to his house without a blessing.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.760]   God wasn't pleased with him.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   The rich young ruler seems very wonderful, "Oh, these have I kept from my youth up."
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.720]   But he went away from Christ sorrowful.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.480]   It isn't enough, my friend, to be good.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.960]   It isn't enough to be moral.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.840]   It isn't enough to be religious.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.320]   It isn't enough to be a church member.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:21.160]   You can do all those things and still you are not reconciled to God, you are not a Christian.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.080]   God seeth the heart.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.720]   Not only that, our Lord reminds us of what God's demand of us is.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.120]   What does God demand of us, do you think?
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.440]   Are you ready to listen to these modern prophets so-called, these false prophets who say that
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.920]   as long as you do your best and avoid certain sins and do a bit of good, that God will smile
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.200]   upon you and all is well?
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.640]   Is that all that God demands?
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   Who told you so?
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   What's your authority?
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   What's your sanction?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.520]   If you listen to this person who says, "I and I alone am the light of the world," you'll
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   find he says this.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.400]   She came to him one afternoon and said, "Now which master is the first and the chiefest
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.600]   commandment of the law?"
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.440]   This was the devastating answer.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:20.640]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.400]   and all thy strength."
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.920]   That is the first and the chiefest commandment.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.040]   And the second is like unto it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.640]   "Yes," says the apostle Paul, "love is the fulfilling of the law."
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   That's it.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   That's God's demand.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.640]   Now that is God's demand, I say, and he is in the position of having a right to demand.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640]   And that is what God demands.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.720]   You see, it isn't what you and I demand, it is what God demands.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.320]   And if we are concerned about being reconciled to God, surely the first thing we should do
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   is not to sit down and think what we think God may ask of us, but listen to what God
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   himself says.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.160]   Here he is speaking through his Son, here is the light of the world saying, "That is
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   God's demand."
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:10.040]   A total allegiance, an entire devotion, nothing less.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:17.160]   And of course the apostle James underlines all that by reminding us of this, that if
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:24.840]   we may keep the whole of the law and fail in one item, we have failed to keep the law.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.040]   Of course, that's obvious, isn't it?
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.560]   You may be a paragon of all the virtues, you may keep the law of England absolutely perfectly,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.280]   but you know, if you fall into transgression, if you break one of the laws and you're there
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.680]   on trial in a police court, and you say, "You know, I've kept all the other laws," it won't
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.120]   help you, you've broken this one.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.600]   So you're guilty before the law and you go to your punishment.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.080]   It's exactly like that with God's law.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.880]   Keep them all, fail in one, and you've broken the law of God.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.800]   God demands of men perfection.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.680]   He made him perfect, he was free from sin, and that is what God demands of men, that
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.560]   is what men should be like.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.800]   He should keep the whole law and love the Lord his God with the whole, the totality
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.640]   of his being.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.200]   So that all this other teaching is wrong, you see, doesn't come anywhere near it, it
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.240]   doesn't begin to approach the problem.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:30.920]   And then when you add to all this that relationships are always between persons, you see, our problem
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:39.280]   is not to satisfy a list of rules and regulations, it's a personal relationship to God.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:46.320]   It isn't, you see, ultimately even a relationship to the law of God, it is to God himself.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.840]   The law of God is just a definition of God's character, of God's person, and of God's
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   being.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.920]   It was given in order that men might have some conception of God, but a man is meant
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.560]   to be in a personal relationship to God.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.160]   God and God is a person whom I can address as that.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.200]   Our Father which art in him, you are praying to a person.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.960]   And God is holy.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:23.800]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all, none at all.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.920]   God is nothing but light.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:32.840]   "Who can dwell with the burning light?" asks one of these men in the Bible.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.000]   Who can approach into his presence?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.760]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all, and he is holy.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.120]   Oh, the holiness of God.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:53.840]   He is righteous, he is just, he is unchangeable, he cannot change because he is eternally one
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   and absolute in all his attributes and characteristics.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.760]   God.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:07.200]   My dear friend, I speak with reverence and with fear.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.760]   It is impossible for God to have any communion with sin.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.600]   It cannot happen.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.560]   Sin cannot exist in the presence of God.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.920]   There is no communion between light and darkness.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.800]   You cannot mix good and evil.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.920]   You cannot bring together holiness and sin.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.760]   The thing is an utter impossibility.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.800]   The character, the being of God, makes it impossible.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.080]   Sin cannot exist near him.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.160]   God punishes sin.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:41.440]   I say he must because he is God and what he is.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:49.920]   Very well, therefore, to talk about just being sorry and saying that I am going to be better
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.720]   and that God will love me and look upon me and smile upon me.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   My dear friend, it does not even begin to see the problem, leave alone solve it.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.520]   No, no, this problem of forgiveness is the most tremendous problem that even the Almighty
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.360]   God has ever confronted.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.200]   You know the problem of forgiveness makes the problem of creation disappear and pale
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.680]   into insignificance.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.080]   It was easy to create.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.240]   He had but to say, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.760]   But when it comes to reconciling men and to forgive sins, a word could not do it.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   He sent his prophets, he gave his law.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   It was not enough.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:31.280]   This is the problem of the universe, the problem of eternity.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:38.160]   How can God forgive a man?
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.320]   That is the light that Jesus Christ throws on the problem.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.600]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.720]   Have you begun to see your need of forgiveness?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.180]   Have you come to see your estrangement from God?
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.740]   Have you seen that you are banished out of God's sight, thrust out of paradise?
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.720]   Have you seen the cherubim and the flaming sword guarding the entrance back?
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.280]   Are you longing to know God and to come back to him?
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.720]   Do you seek God's blessing and his benediction upon your life?
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:10.080]   He says, "I and I alone can give you light on this question."
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.120]   And there is no other light.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.420]   The moment you begin to examine the problem, you will see there is none.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.640]   Very well, let me give you proof of his contention.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.160]   Here is the question.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.200]   What is this Son of God doing in this world?
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.800]   Why did he ever come here?
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.600]   That is the question you have got to answer.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.920]   Why was the incarnation essential?
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.200]   Why did it ever take place?
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.560]   Have you ever thought what it means?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.360]   Here is this blessed person, this second person in the blessed Holy Trinity, from eternity
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:58.280]   in the bosom of the Father, enjoying that unmixed bliss of glory and of eternity, dwelling
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.480]   in the light and glorying in it.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.680]   But he comes out of it all.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.960]   He who made the world and without whom was nothing made that is made, he left it all.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.200]   He came into this world, humbled himself, was born as a helpless babe and put into a
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   manger, mixed with ordinary men and women, heard their blasphemy and their cursing, saw
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.080]   their sin and their evil, shared their life.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.160]   Why has he done it?
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.300]   Why did he have to do it?
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   Why did he come?
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.360]   You have got to answer that question.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.920]   It was not merely to tell us that God is love, you know, that was known in the Old Testament.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:42.200]   "As a father pitieth his children," says the psalm.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.400]   Would you believe this nonsense that there is nothing about the love of God in the Old
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.760]   Testament?
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.240]   The Old Testament is full of the love of God.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.120]   "When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up," says another
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   psalmist.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.800]   That is the love of God.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   Do not talk without knowing what you are saying, my friend.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.680]   The Old Testament is full of the love of God.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.520]   He did not come into the world just to tell us that God was love.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.680]   He did not come to tell us just to live a good and a moral and a clean life.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.920]   The Old Testament did all that.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.720]   That is the meaning of the law and the preaching of the prophets and all these things.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.520]   But you see, that is not enough.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.960]   The Old Testament tells you that it is not enough.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.200]   The Old Testament proclaims the character of God, tells us all about him, all his glorious
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.440]   attributes, love included, tells us the kind of life we should live, but it is not enough.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   How do you know, says someone?
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   Oh, I will tell you how I know.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.160]   The whole of the Old Testament is looking forward.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.760]   It sees the need of a deliverer.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.040]   It is waiting for a Messiah.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.600]   There is a Christ to come.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.960]   There is a Shiloh that is going to appear.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.040]   There is a star that is going to arise out of Jacob and a scepter out of Israel.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.840]   The whole of the Old Testament is looking.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.040]   It is waiting.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.200]   The prophets have it still more clearly.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.320]   We need someone.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   We need deliverance.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.760]   This is but a hope.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.780]   This is just something to keep us going.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.320]   This is not enough, they say.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.240]   We need to be delivered, and there is a deliverer that is going to come.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.880]   The old original promise about the seed of the woman that was going to bruise the serpent's
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.240]   head, here it is.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.600]   What is the meaning of all these burnt offerings and sacrifices that I read about?
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.760]   Why does a lamb have to be killed every morning and every evening and offered in the temple?
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.600]   What is the meaning of these burnt offerings, these meal offerings, all these sacrifices?
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.160]   What is the shedding of blood?
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   What is all this blood in the Old Testament?
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.520]   What is it about?
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:46.040]   Oh, it is all proclaiming just one great message.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.760]   Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:58.320]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.920]   Something has got to be done about this.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.120]   All the blood of bulls and goats is not enough.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   All this is but a type, it is but a shadow.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.360]   It is all pointing to someone who is going to come and do it all.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   Who is he?
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.040]   Here he is, he has come.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.880]   He says, "I am the light of the world.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.240]   I am the answer.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.040]   I am the empty type of all the types.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.440]   I am the fulfillment of all the promises.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.640]   All the promises of God in me are 'Yea, and Amen' to the glory of God.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.040]   I am the light of the world.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.200]   Look at me, listen to me."
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.680]   That is why he came.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.200]   It is the problem of your sin and mine.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.160]   It is this problem of forgiveness.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.200]   That is why he came into the world.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.560]   It could not be done by a word from him.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.160]   My friends, do not misunderstand me.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.800]   I am taking no risk when I say this.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.160]   God could not forgive men by just saying so.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.000]   I will say something more.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.280]   If he could have, he would have.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.800]   But he could not, because he is God.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.320]   So the Son of God came into this world.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   But what for?
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.200]   I ask again, was it merely to teach us?
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.320]   Was it merely to tell us about the love of God?
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.440]   Was it just to give us an example how to live?
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.960]   Was it merely only to help us how to live, as this quotation puts it?
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   No, no.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.760]   There was something prior, there was something that had to come before, and he came to do
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   that.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   So I put the crucial question, why did he come?
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.280]   And the answer is that he came to die.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:50.680]   He came deliberately into this world to die.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.280]   I can prove it to you.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.960]   He said so himself.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.640]   He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.920]   His friends, his followers, appealed to him not to go.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.040]   They said, "You know what's going to happen to you."
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.360]   He did it deliberately.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.680]   He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.960]   And here comes the point when they're about to arrest him.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.040]   "Peter, pull out his sword, pull it back," he says.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.280]   "That's not my way," he says.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.360]   He wouldn't be defended.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.600]   He said, "Don't you know that I could commend twelve legions of angels to carry me to heaven
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.080]   if I wanted to?
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:38.120]   But how could then all righteousness be fulfilled?"
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   He came to die, deliberately.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.240]   That's the great message of this book.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.000]   Listen to the forerunner, John the Baptist.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.160]   What does he say about him?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.520]   Well, there he stands one afternoon with two of his followers, and he says, "Behold,
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:39:05.760]   look at, see, gaze upon the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   That's what he is.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.520]   Before he started doing anything, the forerunner says, "There he is.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.720]   He is the Lamb of God," referring to these Old Testament sacrifices.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.080]   The Lamb of God that was offered morning and evening, the Paschal Lamb, and all the rest.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.360]   The Lamb of God, not men's lambs any longer, God's own Lamb.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.760]   God's provided the sacrifice.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.240]   "Behold, the Lamb of God."
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.680]   What's he come for?
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.960]   Well, not as I read in a paper that's supposed to be evangelical at Easter time on this very
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.800]   text, "Behold, the Lamb of God," that he'd come into the world to help us to have a victory
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.920]   over sin in our lives.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.520]   No, no.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   The Lamb of God comes to be slaughtered, not primarily to help us how to live, but to save
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.920]   us from eternal death.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.160]   The Lamb is going to be offered.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.800]   The Lamb is going to be slaughtered.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.840]   Our sins are transferred to the Lamb.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.720]   The Lamb, the business of the Lamb, is to reconcile us.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.160]   His blood is shed.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.480]   He doesn't help us to live primarily.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   No, no.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.880]   He saves us from eternal death and the punishment that our sins so richly deserve.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.220]   The Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.180]   But listen to him saying it himself.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.680]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.920]   Well, what does he say?
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.760]   What light does he give me on my problem?
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.280]   This is the answer in this same Gospel, chapter 3, verse 14.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:31.640]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:38.520]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:44.960]   Lifted up on a cross, crucified, dead, killed.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.800]   He says, "That's what I'm here for.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.200]   That's my work."
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.760]   And here, you know, in this very chapter that we're looking at, he says later on, he said,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.840]   "Then said Jesus unto them in verse 28, 'When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.040]   you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   I speak these things.'
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.120]   It's still, you see, the same thing about his death.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.600]   Listen to him in chapter 10, "I am the Good Shepherd.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.640]   The Good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   He's not mere leader or exemplar.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.800]   He's not merely leading them to a better way of life.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.960]   He's laying down his life.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.480]   "No man taketh it from me.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.720]   I lay it down of myself," he says.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.180]   I'm only picking up random statements.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.240]   These Gospels are full of it.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:37.880]   Listen to him in chapter 12, "I, if I be lifted up, shall draw all men unto me.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.720]   Father, the hour is come.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.720]   What shall I say?
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.000]   Save me from this hour?
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Nay.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.360]   For this hour came I into the world."
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.640]   The hour?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   The hour of darkness, yes, but the hour when the prince of this world shall be cast out?
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.760]   The hour for which he'd come?
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   Everything leads to this.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.040]   He didn't come merely to live.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.520]   He didn't come merely to teach.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.600]   He came to die.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.280]   The hour?
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   Listen to him again.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.920]   "The Son of Man," he said, "is come not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.880]   to give his life for ransom for many."
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.480]   That's what he says, who is the light of the world.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.680]   And he's talking about this problem of sin.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.240]   But look at him there in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.520]   What's the meaning of his agony?
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.280]   Why is he sweating great drops of blood?
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.000]   Why does he say, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.120]   Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   What's happening there?
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.760]   "My dear friend, why the agony?"
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.000]   "Oh," says somebody, "shrinking from death.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.440]   It's but human to do so."
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   Nonsense.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.080]   The martyrs never did that.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.840]   The martyrs preached on the stake.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.640]   They gloried as they were thrown into the arena to the lions that they were accounted
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.120]   worthy to suffer shame for his name's sake.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   You're making him less than his own followers.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   No, no.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   Why the blood?
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   Why the sweat?
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   Why the agony?
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.920]   I'll tell you.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:08.240]   He was facing this terrible problem.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:15.680]   Yet there was only one way whereby men could be forgiven.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:23.840]   And that is that their sins should be put upon him, and that he should bear their punishment.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.440]   And that punishment involved separation from his blessed Father.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.680]   He who had looked into the face of God from all eternity could see that a moment would
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:38.120]   come when clothed with the sins of men, he wouldn't see his Father and would feel forsaken.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:48.280]   So he cries upon the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.000]   That's what he came to do.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.880]   Listen to him expounding it after his resurrection.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   You'll find it at the end of the last chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.680]   "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:09.240]   the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   all nations."
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:20.960]   There is no repentance or remission of sins except in his name.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.840]   And the apostles came to see it.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:28.080]   Peter could say, "There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.320]   must be saved."
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.640]   But as Paul preached in Thessalonica, isn't it this?
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:43.160]   That the Christ must needs of suffer and that this Jesus which I preach unto you is the
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.880]   Christ.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.520]   He must suffer, he must die.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.480]   The deliverer is not to be a political personage.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:55.920]   No, no, he's one who's got to suffer and die.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.440]   The death of Christ and the glory that should follow.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.680]   And so the apostle is able to remind the Corinthians when he writes to them later on that which
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.000]   I delivered unto you at the beginning, he said, "What was it?
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.320]   Well that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that he was buried and
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.280]   that he rose the third day according to the Scriptures.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.120]   What is the message of the Gospel?
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.600]   What have I got to preach as an ambassador of Christ?
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.840]   Isn't it this?
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:35.280]   That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them their
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   trespasses.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:44.560]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.080]   of God in him.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.120]   Yes, says Peter.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.280]   How have you been redeemed?
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:56.920]   Not with gold or silver or any such thing, but with the precious blood of Christ as of
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.840]   a lamb without blemish and without spot.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.560]   What is it that gives me forgiveness?
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:11.760]   The blood of Jesus Christ, says John, cleanseth us from all sin and unrighteousness.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:17.720]   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:23.880]   is the propitiation of our sins and not of ours only, but also of the sins of the whole
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.880]   world.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:41.560]   Yes, says John, having his vision on Patmos, unto him that has loved us and washed us in
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   his own blood.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.480]   That is what makes a man a Christian, my friend.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:01.080]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.400]   It is the only way.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:18.320]   Sin must be punished, and sin has been punished in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.600]   He is the Lamb of God.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:29.240]   God has smitten him by his stripes.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.880]   We are healed.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:39.680]   God has set him forth as a propitiation for our sins.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:53.480]   It is by his blood, his death, that we are forgiven and are reconciled to God.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:48:02.960]   That is the light that he gives upon this first and most vital problem.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.800]   Have you got it?
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.600]   Have you seen it?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.800]   Do you know that your sins are forgiven?
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:21.360]   Have you ever seen the need of forgiveness?
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:28.160]   Had you realized that the problem of your sin was such that nothing but the coming of
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:36.800]   the Son of God into this world from heaven, and his dying upon the cross and his blood
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:47.440]   being shed, could possibly have delivered you and solved the problem?
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:57.640]   It is by him and by him alone, Jesus Christ, and him crucified, that we are reconciled
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:10.360]   to God, become children of God, are blessed by God, are saved out of the world from hell
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:20.400]   and to heaven and glory and the bliss of eternity.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.760]   Are you in the light?
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.200]   Do you see it?
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:31.240]   Do you realize that the Son of God has so loved you that he died for you?
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.120]   Have you fled to him?
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.480]   Are you hiding in Christ?
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.840]   Have you pleaded with him to receive you?
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:51.440]   Have you turned to him and said, "Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   thee.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:50:03.360]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed be of sin the double cure.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.920]   Cleanse me from its guilt and power."
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:20.720]   It is the only way of forgiveness, the only way to be reconciled to God, the only way
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:27.280]   to lose the fear of death and the grave and the judgment and eternity, the end of the
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:42.400]   world and all things, to become a child of God and well beloved in his holy sight.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.560]   Fly to him.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:56.160]   Let the healing stream flow upon you and cleanse you and deliver you and heal you.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   Amen.
