[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320]   All right, if you have your Bibles and your notebooks in front of you, you want to take
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.180]   them and turn them over to the information here that deals with the outline here for
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.840]   the Marriage and Family Counseling course.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.440]   The first thing that we need to do is we have to define what is the family.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.200]   Now normally, I can remember teaching this almost 30 years ago or teaching about marriage
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.000]   and the family 30 years ago, and we didn't have to define this because everybody understood
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   it.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.800]   Everybody understood when I referred to the family, everybody understood what we were
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   talking about.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.520]   A father and a mother with children and sometimes with children, the traditional nuclear family.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:58.360]   But nowadays, things have been so vastly redefined that we have to answer the question, what
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.920]   is the family?
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.400]   There was an interesting article that appeared a few years ago in National and International
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.640]   Religion Report, and it's interesting that, and actually this is a quote from pollster
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.920]   George Gallup, and he makes a statement, "If a disease were to afflict the majority of
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.000]   a populace, spreading pain and dysfunction throughout all age groups, we would be frantically
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   searching for reasons and solutions."
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.360]   Yet he said, "One particular scourge has become so endemic that it is virtually ignored.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   The scourge," he says, "is divorce, an oddly neglected topic."
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:55.240]   He goes on and says, "Divorce is a root problem and is the cause of any number of other ills."
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440]   In fact, he says, "For many, marriage today is a losing gamble.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480]   Six out of 10 new marriages fail.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.520]   Victims of divorce or separation.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.580]   Reports on the National Survey of Families and Households at the University of Wisconsin
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.140]   yields those kind of statistics.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.540]   The cold statistics also have a human heart to them.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.380]   Divorces like suffering death without a funeral," said one woman still grieving over her marriage
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.900]   that had broke apart after eight years.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.620]   The pain never ends.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.500]   It's a living death.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.460]   Even though most divorced people eventually remarry, about 60% of second marriages fail.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.500]   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the University of Minnesota's
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:48.580]   Dr. David Olson reports 65% of the marriages that managed to remain intact still are profoundly
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580]   unhappy.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.100]   40% are devitalized, that's the way he chooses to refer to them, devitalized, filled with
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.460]   dissatisfaction in every dimension of the relationship.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.100]   Another 25% of the marriages are almost as discontent and weak.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.820]   But the problem is broader than divorce.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.100]   So it's not just divorce that's happening in marriages, but it's people living in very
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.260]   unhappy marriages.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.780]   And the question is, why is this going on?
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.580]   Why is this happening?
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.460]   Well, we believe that the scriptures have the answer to this.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.720]   You don't have to look very far.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.940]   Many of you know, even in your own families and extended families, some of the grief and
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.060]   heartache that divorce, maybe you've experienced it as even as a child growing up, your parents'
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.380]   marriage didn't survive.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.140]   Or you know of an aunt or uncle or somebody that's close to you whose marriage didn't
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.900]   survive.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.260]   Or maybe you know in tragic situations of friends, leadership in your church, maybe
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.580]   even your own pastor whose marriage didn't survive.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.660]   How many times have I counseled pastoral couples who have been in ministry several years and
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.900]   they're having serious marital conflict and problems?
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.300]   Well, the answer to this question, what is the family, is important because many today
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.220]   are minimizing the importance of the family or they have erroneous ideas about what the
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.500]   family is and the role that it should play in our society in general or in the lives
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.480]   of people in particular.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.940]   In fact, the biblical concept of the family has been strenuously opposed by many people
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:54.100]   around the world.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:04.460]   I want to give you a few instances of that if I can.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:14.100]   For example, Karl Marx, you remember he was the infamous author of the Communist Manifesto.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.300]   And in 1848 when he wrote the Communist Manifesto, he makes this statement.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.100]   He says, "On what foundation is the present family?"
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:37.460]   The bourgeois family based, he asks, on capital, on private gain is his answer.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.580]   In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeois.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.900]   But this state of things finds its complement in the enforced absence of the family among
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.060]   the proletarians, which is the lower class, and in public prostitution.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.500]   The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes and
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.220]   both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.060]   The bourgeois claptrap about the family and education, about the hallowed relationship
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.140]   of parent and the child becomes all the more disgusting the more by the action of modern
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:23.100]   industry all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.940]   into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labor.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.220]   So he sees the family as primarily a product of an industrial society that's driven by
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:44.940]   the desire to make more and more capital.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.320]   And it's the use of the proletarians or the lower class of people by the middle class,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:07:01.500]   the bourgeois, that keeps people in this enslaved state.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:10.380]   That's Karl Marx's view on the family, which is radically opposed to what obviously the
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.260]   scripture would say about this.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.540]   There was another book entitled "People Making" by an American therapist by the name of Virginia
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.140]   Satter.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:35.820]   In her last chapter on the family of the future she sketches the basic Christian and
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.900]   traditional ethic of the family and then asks the question why should we accept this as
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.060]   the only possible way?
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:51.780]   So she lays out what the Christian view of the family is and the traditional view of
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:58.020]   the family and she says why should we accept this as the only way?
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:05.420]   In fact she suggests a variety of things that might happen in the future.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.820]   She says what if all the practices now going on which we have labeled as morally bad were
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.300]   instead really evidence of great variations in human beings.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.580]   In the case of many times married person, perhaps there are some people whose level
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.140]   of interest is short and so they choose one mate after another.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.380]   Instead of considering this a shortcoming, what would happen if we treated this as a
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.020]   simple variation?
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.560]   Such people could enter a limited marital contract, say from one to five years, if the
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.980]   contract were not renewed at the end then dissolution of the marriage could take place.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.740]   Perhaps the married people who have heterosexual relationships outside of marriage are not
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.420]   simply adulterers but are people with a human need.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:03.220]   After all, ploandery, which is a woman with many husbands, and polygamy, which is a man
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.660]   with many wives, were once respected forms of marriage.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.820]   And why not have a group of communal marriage?
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.340]   When you think about it, marriage merely legalizes a relationship between a male and a female
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:26.220]   adult that entitles them to certain property and a certain guarantee against exploitation.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.820]   Why does it have to be limited to just one man and one woman?
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.180]   If we fully trusted one another and were truly responsible, we would not be exploitive and
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   we would share fairly.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:45.300]   You see what she's saying, saying if a person has gone in and out of marriage several times,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.180]   then maybe it's really not a shortcoming on that person's part, that's just one variation
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.980]   of a different type of person, and why don't we view it as a variation?
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.220]   So we'll create a special type of marriage category for this person.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.220]   This is the type of person who will have a marriage for maybe two, three years, maybe
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.260]   five years, and then at the end of that particular contract it can be renewed, and if it's not
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.220]   renewable then they can move into another relationship.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.700]   Or why do we have a problem accepting a woman that has several husbands, or a palandery,
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.420]   or polygamy?
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.740]   Why do we have a problem with a man who has several wives?
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:32.220]   Why do we have a problem with that, she says.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.420]   So she defines marriage as merely legalizing a relationship between a male and female adult
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.240]   that entitles them to certain property and a certain guarantee against exploitation.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.580]   That's her definition of marriage.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:52.740]   Now we're going to take exception to that, but that's the way that she would view it.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:11:07.620]   Virginia Satter, S-A-T-I-R, in a book entitled People Making, she's an American therapist.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:13.560]   Or some of you remember Alvin Toffler, now many of you in our class are not old enough
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:21.020]   to remember clear back to the 1970s, unfortunately I do, and a very famous book came out then
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.540]   called Future Shock.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:31.620]   And in that book Toffler actually, he has a chapter in that book entitled The Frustrated
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:38.100]   Family where he depicts motherhood and he says, "Motherhood is killed in the future
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.220]   by birth technology and parenthood as a convenient legal and financial arrangement is soon to
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.380]   be dispatched."
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.780]   He envisions professional parents who bring up children from many biological sources and
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:56.300]   communes of three to six parents where biological origins will be happily confused.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.540]   There will be geriatric group families, homosexual family units, and so on and so on.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.620]   The odds are very heavily against the monogamous pattern as a provider of fulfillment and satisfaction.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:17.540]   That's what Toffler was writing back in 1970, almost 40 years ago.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.820]   Toffler sees tailor-made divorce with serial marriage as the new pattern starting quite
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:30.100]   naturally with trial marriage before anyone understands the first proper one.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.420]   He admits that the stability and the sense of continuity afforded by the traditional
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.860]   family pattern of birth, growth, parenthood, and fidelity is undermined by this future
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.200]   prediction but he does not believe that the traditional family can survive.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.860]   So he's saying that back in 1970s.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.000]   That's when I was in college.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.900]   They're predicting the demise of the family.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.060]   When you take a look at what the United Nations says about the family, I don't know whether
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:10.320]   you've read very much about that but that is certainly eye-opening.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:26.460]   To the United Nations, family is whatever anyone wants it to be and everyone is invited.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:45.740]   Back in 1994, 1994 was referred to as the International Year of the Family by the United
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740]   Nations.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.140]   The United Nations General Secretary at that time, Boutros Ghali, calls the International
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.220]   Year of the Family a celebration of the family in all of its many cultural and societal forms
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.720]   adding that the diversity of society is fully reflected in the diversity of our families.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.920]   There's no single definition of family, there's no one model, he says.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.140]   In fact, the UN's International Year of the Family Handbook says that the family is the
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:16.520]   basic unit of society and it's described as a vital means of preserving and transmitting
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.820]   cultural values, end of quote.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.220]   Well wow, we could say that as Christians.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.420]   We could reproduce that word for word.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.540]   The family is a basic unit of society and described as a vital means of preserving and
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.100]   transmitting cultural values.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:36.540]   Hey, there's nothing wrong with that but what he means by the family is totally different
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:44.860]   than what we mean by the family because a few sentences later he makes this statement
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.340]   or a statement is made in that pamphlet that says many societies change the nature of what
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:55.940]   is considered a family, exposure to ideas and behavioral norms beyond traditional spheres
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.660]   and to the different lifestyles is praised as a positive development since it permits
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:06.500]   additional opportunities for more diversified lives.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.660]   Now this is the culture that you're going out to minister in, it's everywhere, it's
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.900]   all over the world.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.660]   Now what does the UN mean, the United Nations mean about diversified lives?
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.940]   Well they mean plenty and in International Year of the Family document entitled the Changing
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.780]   Family Structure, the UN describes various family, types of family units as comparable
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.820]   and equally acceptable.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.700]   Polygamous and community families are lumped together on an equal footing with biological
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.980]   and adoptive families.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.020]   Same gender families are also included in the listing.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:51.380]   So you can have anything, you can have polygamy, philanthropy, homosexual, lesbian relationships
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:59.140]   as all lumped into this very generalized idea of what the family is.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.780]   Jane Carney Schultz is the International Year of the Family's North American coordinator
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:11.460]   and she says the family is such a subjective thing, really.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.160]   The family is a subjective thing.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.340]   She goes and said it's important to accept that there are a lot of different models,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.400]   whether it's two women or two men raising children.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.780]   So in the International Year of the Family promotional literature provided by Schultz
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.780]   entitled Gay and Lesbian Community Groups are listed under the heading Could Child and
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:41.180]   Family Oriented and Family, Child and Family Oriented Contacts.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.420]   And in that same article it says new forms of the family life have developed to meet
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.900]   the challenges of the modern world.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.460]   The UN's International Year of the Family handbook adds that policies affecting the
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.700]   family should seek to avoid promoting implicitly or explicitly a single ideal image of the
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.980]   family.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.540]   So they'd hate a class like ours.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:11.700]   They wouldn't like this at all because we're promoting a single ideal image of the family,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.220]   not because this is Professor John Street's interpretation of the family.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.580]   It's what the word of God says the family is supposed to be.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.140]   They go on and say we're trying to encourage the stability that families give, said UN
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.460]   spokesman William Haas, but we're not going to get trapped into any definition of the
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   family.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460]   Trapped.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:42.180]   It goes on and says it's a diversified world and unless we respect that we cannot achieve
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.180]   any progress.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:51.300]   No one has a monopoly on the best form, definition, or concept of the family.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.380]   Schultz says I think the UN's attitude about diversity and accepting all kinds of families
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.460]   without any definition is really excellent.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.340]   So there we have it.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:18.640]   So some of the things that Marx predicted, Sater predicted, Toffler predicted, is already
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:25.860]   reaping huge fruit in international definitions of the family.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.460]   What is the family?
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:40.540]   O.R. Johnson, in a book entitled Who Needs the Family?
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.420]   How about that?
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.060]   In a book entitled Who Needs the Family?
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.520]   Listen to the way that he describes the traditional family.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.420]   He says in traditional pre-industrial societies the family was a type of microcosm undertaking
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.060]   itself most of the tasks which the family group needed to survive.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.100]   It may be useful to list these functions as anthropologists and sociologists have analyzed
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.100]   them.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.500]   Firstly, the family regulated sexual expression and satisfaction, thus preventing constant
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.300]   conflict, confusion, and competition.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.260]   Second, the family regulated the production of children, thus ensuring that the community
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.260]   continued.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.620]   Thirdly, the family socialized the children, transmitting the culture and ensuring, therefore,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:26.460]   that they become mature citizens at some point in the future to enter into a productive and
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.260]   continuing life as a society.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.740]   Fourth, the family protected the children.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.460]   This protective form was in most cases undertaken not only in relationship to the children,
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.540]   but also to their grandparents.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.580]   The active adults in most societies have not only handed duties downward to their children,
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.980]   but also upwards to their elderly patients.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.380]   Fifthly, after protection comes simple economic division of labor.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.980]   This is seen in the most primitive societies where there are hunting societies or gathering
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   societies.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.460]   It is the father who hunts or gathers and it is the mother who rears the children.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:07.740]   And sixthly, the family provides other resources which we can lump together, health care, recreation,
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.540]   training for work, initiating into religion and myth, lore and literature.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.060]   All these tasks in early societies and in most primitive societies today were and are
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.180]   undertaken in the family for itself.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.900]   Admittedly, there was sometimes a certain degree of specialization in addition.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.860]   There was the priest for religion and medicine for the man for the health, but the family
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:36.380]   was a many-faceted operational group rich in a variety of tasks and it could shoulder
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.500]   for itself.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.600]   A broad generalization is at once obvious.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.780]   In the transition from primitive to modern Western types of society, many of these functions
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.940]   have become institutionalized outside the home.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.620]   So we don't need that.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:01.060]   So he basically sets up a description of what the family was supposed to do by his definition.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.660]   And then he begins to set it up in such a way that, well, in our industrialized society
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:11.980]   today, there are other institutions that have taken over for these purposes that the family
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.980]   provided.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:19.540]   And therefore, the implication is we really don't need the traditional family.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.460]   He says, "We have witnessed the stripping of the family of many of its former reasons
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.500]   for existence and the handing over of these tasks to other specialized agencies put very
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.480]   crudely in modern societies.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.560]   Work itself, that is economically profitable work, employment in order to exist, mostly
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.720]   goes on outside of the home.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   Religion is left to the churches or perhaps as a vestigial superstition to the astrology
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.160]   columns of magazines.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:57.000]   Work training is provided by an industry or by the state or by a specialized institution.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.520]   Only it now only rarely occurs in the family."
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.840]   So he's beginning to go through and just systematically, piece by piece, show how the industrialized
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.660]   society has taken over for the family.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.840]   His ultimate argument is basically, "Who needs a family?
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.640]   Who needs it?
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   You don't need it any longer.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:30.240]   We have all kinds of organizations and institutions out there that have basically
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.480]   supplanted the family's role.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:42.080]   So why should there be any kind of problem with redefining the family?"
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.440]   Well, you get the idea.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.400]   Here's we've got up on the screen.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   There are many people today minimizing the importance of the family or they have erroneous
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.600]   ideas about what the family is and the role that it should play in society in general
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.400]   or in the lives of people in particular.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.160]   Now in asking the question, what is the family?
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.760]   Second thing we want to make an observation here is that the answer to this question is
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.040]   important because it has consequences.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.280]   It has consequences.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:35.000]   If your conclusion about whatever the family is, if that's wrong, it will affect you and
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:47.520]   it will affect the way that you minister in horrible ways.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.200]   If for example you don't understand what a church or a school is, then you don't know
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.000]   what to do with it.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.560]   You have to understand what something is if you are going to use it correctly.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.940]   You can hardly be expected to be able to benefit from something like a church or a school if
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:18.180]   you don't know what it is and you're confused about what it is.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.040]   Some of you have probably seen the old movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy" where an African
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.140]   Bushman finds a coke bottle and he doesn't know what it is.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:35.760]   So he tries to use it as a hammer and that doesn't work and he tries to use it as hanging
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.720]   on his body somehow and it's too awkward to hang it on his body and he doesn't know what
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:49.920]   the function of this particular item is because he's never seen a coke bottle before.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.420]   Back ten years ago when we moved out to California, we were like that.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.740]   I was put in charge by my wife of cleaning out our garage.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.420]   Now we had lived in one location for many, many years and you can really collect a lot
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.440]   of stuff when you live in one location for many, many years.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.140]   And I found stuff in that garage I haven't seen for years and I couldn't remember what
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.140]   it was.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.860]   And if I didn't know what it was, then I didn't know, it looked important though, I didn't
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.300]   know whether I should throw it away or keep it and if I kept it, I didn't know what I'd
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.460]   use it for.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.820]   But I was scared to throw it away.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.820]   Should I throw that thing away?
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.820]   I don't know.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.820]   What is that thing?
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.780]   It looks really familiar to me.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.780]   That's the way it is.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.220]   If you don't know what the family is, then you're not going to really know how to use
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.220]   it.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:50.680]   If you don't know how to use it, then that's going to have huge consequences in your ministry.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.580]   This is what happens when people don't clearly understand the answer to the question, what
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.020]   is the family?
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.700]   Because ideas have consequences.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:07.980]   The way you think about and conceive of marriage, family, the role of the husband, the role
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:14.420]   of the wife, the role of the parent, the function of children in the family, how the children
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.020]   are supposed to respond to the parents, how the parents are supposed to respond to the
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:24.260]   children, the way that you conceive of these things drastically affects not only that family
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:30.980]   but all of society and even your church if you don't understand it correctly.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.800]   The answer to this question is important because destroying the biblical family is one of Satan's
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.260]   primary objectives.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.980]   That's certainly true.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:51.180]   Scripture tells us in many places that we who are believers are really involved in a
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.700]   war.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.940]   We're involved in a war.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.740]   It's not a war that you can see.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:13.380]   You don't see the fighting going on literally, but it is nonetheless a war with lots of casualties.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   Describe your Bible just for a moment.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:21.540]   Let's go over to 2 Corinthians 10 and let's take a look at verses 3 through 5.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:28.340]   2 Corinthians 10 and verses 3 through 5.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:33.340]   Paul says here, "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.460]   for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but are divinely powerful for the
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.160]   destruction of fortresses.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.960]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God,
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.240]   and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.960]   There's part of that warfare.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:03.760]   This is not a medieval mystical type of warfare with gargoyles and demons hiding under every
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   rock.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   That's not the idea of this warfare.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   In the context of this, Paul is talking about an ideological warfare that is very demonic,
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:29.000]   but not demonic in a medieval sense, but demonic in just as a devastating sense because it
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.480]   is destroying the way that people think about life and reality.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:45.200]   Paul says he goes to battle, not against flesh and blood, but against these wrong ideas about
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.440]   life.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.600]   That's his ministry.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:55.280]   These ideologies, these speculations, these lofty things that are raised up against the
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.680]   knowledge of God.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:05.280]   Paul is trying to promote and uplift the knowledge of God.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.960]   Not human knowledge.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:14.320]   The scripture is very clear that there is a war that's going on there.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:24.920]   Let's go over to 2 Timothy 2, 3 and 4.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.800]   Here he says, "Suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.560]   No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life so that he
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:43.800]   So in this warfare, we're called to be soldiers in this kind of ministry.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:52.880]   We've got to see ourselves as soldiers, but we're ideological warriors where the word
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.740]   of God is our primary tool.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.680]   This is what we minister.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:04.560]   Not only that, but other scriptures make it clear that our real enemy in this war is Satan
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:19.040]   and demonic forces.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:26.840]   We go over to Ephesians 6, verses 11 and 12.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   Here Paul says, "Put on the full armor of God so that you may able to stand firm against
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.720]   the schemes of the devil."
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.880]   You see the little phrase "of God," you take a look at that in the Greek, that's a genitive
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   of source.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.260]   It's God who's the one who supplies, he's the source of the armor.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.280]   It's a genitive of source.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   He's the source of the armor.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:07.500]   "So that you may be able to stand firm," that is hold your ground, "against the devil."
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:14.240]   And the word for devil is diabolos, which is the word that in the early Greek was a
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.500]   word for slanderer.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:27.320]   So it's probably descriptive of Satan's main tool, and that is to slander the truth, slander
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   you as a messenger of the truth, is the implication.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.240]   Then in verse 12 he says, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.760]   the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.800]   spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places."
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:54.920]   And then verse 13 says, "Therefore take up the full armor of God so that you will be
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:06.800]   able to resist," that's our Greek word, "anthistemi," resist.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:14.160]   This is an aorist active infinitive, "anthistemi," stand against, challenge, oppose in the evil
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:24.560]   day and having done everything to stand firm by putting on Christ.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:33.160]   So God tells us that our enemy is a real enemy.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:40.360]   Even though we can't see this enemy, taste this enemy, feel this enemy, this enemy is
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.280]   very, very real.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.720]   And we have to stand firm against this enemy.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   And our war is against Satan and that of demonic forces.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:58.600]   Take your Bible again, let's go over to 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 8.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:04.400]   Here's our adversary, "Be a sober spirit," he says, "be on alert, your adversary the
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:12.520]   devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:18.680]   So we have an adversary that is looking out to devour us.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.480]   So we're in a war, this is an ideological war.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.700]   Our main enemy is Satan who is a slanderer.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:33.880]   He slanders the truth, he slanders agents of the truth.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.400]   And we are called upon to be good soldiers and to take our stand, to stand against.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:46.320]   There's where our word, "anthistemi," stand firm, stand against, against him.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.920]   Thirdly, Satan and his demonic forces are opposed to God and all that God stands for,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:59.960]   all that God wants, Satan and his demonic forces are in veritable adversaries or enemies
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.900]   of God.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:22.740]   So now, nowhere is this particular battle more intense, I believe, than in the area
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:29.220]   of marriage and the family.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:36.420]   And we can see it throughout modern society today, or we could even say post-modern society
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:44.880]   today, even though there are a lot of philosophers who believe that we've even moved beyond post-modernity,
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:53.140]   but we can see that and how it's affecting the family.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.880]   And we would say this, that anyone who is in touch with what is happening in the area
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:04.340]   of marriage and family life knows that the changes that have taken place ideologically
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.880]   and structurally in the last 50 years have been nothing short of catastrophic.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.540]   More changes have taken place in the last 50 years than have taken place in the thousands
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:19.380]   of years previously.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.500]   That's devastating to think about.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:28.880]   There has been radical, radical changes that have occurred in the last 50 years.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.620]   Changes that have been so dramatic and so sweeping that our great, great, great, great
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.260]   grandparents would be shocked by what has occurred.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.380]   So things are changing very, very rapidly.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:54.520]   Fourth, Satan has declared war on the family and now is focusing much of his attention
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:03.660]   on the family because he knows how important the family is.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.340]   What is it that Satan knows?
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.300]   You understand that Satan is far more intelligent than we will ever be.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.200]   He's existed long before we existed.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.940]   He saw and was very much a part of the fall of man.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:22.260]   He's seen all of humanity from the beginning right up until this very moment.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.280]   He studied human behavior.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.220]   He studied the way in which human beings have interacted with life and circumstances and
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.900]   stress and difficulty and hardship.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.860]   He's seen all of this and he knows.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:41.500]   He predicts, he's not omniscient like God, but he certainly predicts and is a good predictor
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.940]   of how we're going to respond to certain things and what we think about things.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.700]   We can't out-think him.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   What is it that he knows?
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.860]   He knows that the family is the basic building block of every other social institution, social
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.820]   unit or institution.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:03.060]   He knows that.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.980]   How is it that God started the world?
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:19.020]   He started the world not with the church, not with some kind of government, but he started
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.740]   the world with a family.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.500]   That's the way God started the world.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.660]   It was Adam and Eve.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.700]   It was not good that man be alone.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.060]   I will make a helper suitable for him.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.780]   That's the way everything got started.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.260]   Satan understands that.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.060]   It is the basic building block.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:59.460]   There is theological priority given to the family in Genesis 1, 2 and 3.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:07.860]   It was through the family relationship that sin comes into the world.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.860]   What else does Satan know?
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.880]   Satan knows that the command to multiply, replenish, fill and subdue the earth was given
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.340]   to a family unit.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.540]   Satan knows that as well.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:26.140]   It was given to a family unit.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   Grab your Bible for a moment.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:34.940]   Let's go back to Genesis chapter 1 and verse 28.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:41.300]   Some theologians call this the cultural mandate.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:47.060]   God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.900]   it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.860]   thing that moves on the earth."
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.600]   We can see that part of the blessing that God gives the husband and wife relationship
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.080]   is that of children.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.320]   Right from the very beginning.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:15.660]   That's part of the blessing upon that relationship is children.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.300]   Satan understands that.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.700]   That was something that was given to a family unit.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:27.980]   Something that he could do to interrupt that or stop that.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:37.140]   Because when families thrive, then the image of God thrives.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.260]   We can see this.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.260]   What else does Satan know?
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:49.900]   Well, Satan knows that the family is unique and irreplaceable in God's program.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   The family is very unique and irreplaceable in God's program.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:16.860]   The family is not one of several different type of optional ways that people should live.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:25.780]   It was God's only declared way for people to live.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.720]   God didn't create polygamy.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:40.660]   He didn't create, you've heard the old story, God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:46.420]   He didn't do that.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.100]   God didn't create a lesbian relationship from the beginning.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:41:01.220]   He created a husband and wife relationship so that the two sexes, the male and the female,
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:08.660]   can complement one another in their gender distinctiveness.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:14.620]   That is lost in every other definition of the family.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:25.060]   Satan knows that and if Satan can destroy that concept, he can destroy the family.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:25.560]   Thank you.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.060]   [END]
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   1.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   The Family is Unique and Irreplaceable in God's Program.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.060]   The Family is Not One of Several Different Type of Optional Ways that People Should Live.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   The Family is Not One of Several Different Type of Optional Ways that People Should Live.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   The Family is Not One of Several Different Type of Optional Ways that People Should Live.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   The Family is Not One of Several Different Type of Optional Ways that People Should Live.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.060]   The Family is Not One of Several Different Type of Optional Ways that People Should Live.
