[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   I am going to read the first two verses in the tenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.160]   Romans, reading verses one and two.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.280]   Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.360]   For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.480]   Now we are engaged at the beginning of this tenth chapter of this epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.240]   and as I was indicating when we began to study it last Friday night, it is indeed a most
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.960]   interesting, a most vital, and a most important statement.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.920]   What gives it added importance, of course, is that it comes immediately after chapter
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   nine.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.400]   Chapter nine, notoriously, is one of the most difficult as well as one of the greatest chapters
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.480]   in the whole of the Bible, with its great doctrine of the sovereignty of God, the ultimate,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.840]   final sovereignty of God in the matter of salvation.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.480]   But suddenly the apostle, having dealt with that, introduces this further section and
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.440]   division of what he's got to say, and he does so by means of these two verses that we are
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   examining.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   Now, I am concerned at the moment, before we come to the particular application which
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.120]   the apostle himself makes of what he's saying, I am concerned at the moment to draw certain
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.840]   general lessons from what the apostle does.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.240]   Our interest in the scriptures must never be merely academic or theoretical or intellectual.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.160]   We are to be interested in that way.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.240]   We'll never derive any benefit unless we are.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   But it's not merely to be intellectual or academic or theoretical.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.160]   We should study the scriptures in order that we may profit from them, in order that we
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.920]   may have light and guidance upon our own lives and upon our own conduct and behavior.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.120]   And thus I am trying to show you that what the apostle does here has a great deal to
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   teach us at this present moment.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   Now, we've already drawn two general lessons.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.840]   The first is, of course, the lesson that we learn from the great apostle here in the whole
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.600]   matter of how we are to treat those who are unbelievers, and especially those to whom
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.080]   we are bound closely by ties of nationality or country or blood or family or some such
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   tie.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.360]   Here is the apostle reviled and persecuted by his own fellow countrymen, the Jews, and
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   yet we notice that his heart is full of tenderness, that his heart's desire for them and there
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.760]   is prayer for them is that they might be saved.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.800]   And he's as ready as any man can be to pick out anything good that he can find about them
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.480]   in order to praise it and to commend it.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   We've looked at that great lesson.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   We also looked at a second general lesson, which was this, the relationship between doctrine
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.600]   and practice.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.360]   And our final conclusion at the end of that was to say this, that if our understanding
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.280]   of doctrine has the effect of paralyzing us or making us do nothing or making us feel
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   that it's no use being anxious about your loved ones who are unsaved, or if it says
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.360]   that you need never pray about them, that there's no purpose in doing so, or never
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   speak to them or preach to them, well then, there's only one thing to say, and that
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.680]   is that you've misunderstood the doctrine.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120]   Instead of following the doctrine of the Scripture, you've been following your own little logic
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.320]   and your own little confined cramped reason, and you've found yourself in a position
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.080]   in which a Christian should never be.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.960]   Here is a man of all levels who teaches the sovereign election of God, but his heart yearns
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.280]   for his countrymen.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.720]   He not only yearns for them, he prays for them, and he does everything he can in order
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   to bring them to salvation.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.560]   Very well, it's the most important lesson.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.920]   This relationship between doctrine and practiceâ€”and we are always wrong if our understanding of
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.040]   doctrine paralyzes us, makes us feel there's no point in doing anything, and leads to that
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.200]   terrible result in which we actually do nothing.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.320]   Now then, we've done that, but I do repeat it because it is most important as an introduction
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   to what we've got to consider tonight.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   Very well, then, if it is wrong, I say, to be paralyzed, if it is wrong to do nothing,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.840]   what is right?
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.360]   What should we do?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.320]   What should be the position of the Christian?
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.840]   And here, the answer that is generally returned at the present time in particular is that
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   we should be full of zeal.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.080]   We should be full of a zealous spirit.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.480]   But the very statement of the apostle compels us to examine that, for he tells us in the
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:36.960]   second verse, "I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.600]   So we are driven by his very statement and the way he puts it to examine this whole question
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.240]   of zeal in the life of the Christian.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.120]   And as I want to try to show you, this is a most urgent problem and question for every
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.560]   one of us as individual Christians and for the Church as a whole just at this present
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.040]   moment, and for this reason, for these reasons rather.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:13.160]   The first is that the whole position in which we find ourselves as Christians is so desperate,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.240]   so alarming, I mean by that the very figures and statistics that Christians, putting it
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.160]   at its highest, are only some ten percent of the population of this country, and only
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.680]   half of those attend a place of worship with any regularity.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.120]   Not only that, we are aware of the declining moral situation, the whole collapse of morals,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.840]   and the terrible confusion in so many departments of life at the present time.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.320]   The position is desperate.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.840]   And so many people in the face of that are tempted to say, "We must do something."
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.400]   The mere, sheer desperate position in which we find ourselves drives them to say, "Well,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.640]   at any rate, those people are doing something, and it's better to be doing something than
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.980]   to be doing nothing."
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:10.240]   Any position of desperation inevitably tends to call for action and for activity, and the
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   more desperate the position, the more liable we are to think and to imagine that anything
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   that is done must of necessity be right, because at any rate we are doing something, and we
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.920]   are not just sitting back in a paralyzed condition doing nothing at all.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.560]   So there is one reason why we must of necessity consider this.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.680]   But let me give you another one.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.880]   There is a great tendency at the present time to say that in the last analysis nothing really
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:55.080]   matters but zeal, or, to use another word, sincerity.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.360]   Now you will find so many saying today, it's indeed one of the most common things that
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.120]   one sees or in print or one hears in conversation, that at a desperate moment like this, in this
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   country and in the whole position, in the entire world, nothing matters except that
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.080]   Christian people get together and act together and do something to stem the tide of communism
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.160]   or of immorality or any other reason that may be threatening.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.120]   They say, "What's it matter what you believe?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.200]   If you can get hold of a body of sincere, zealous people who are anxious to do something,
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.720]   this is no time to be questioning as to what they believe about this doctrine or that doctrine."
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   They say, "When the whole house is on fire, isn't it being rather ridiculous to be paying
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.000]   attention to particular pieces of furniture?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The thing to do is to do something, to put out the fire, and not to be quibbling with
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.320]   one another about particular articles of the Christian faith."
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.680]   Now you are familiar with that.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:02.600]   That is more or less what is being said in terms of what is called the ecumenical movement.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.320]   This is a day we are told, when any man who calls himself a Christian, whatever he may
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.120]   believe in detail, is a man to whom, to give the right hand of fellowship, I am to work
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.200]   with him and we are to stand together and do all we can in a sincere and zealous manner.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.960]   They say, "What's it matter what a man believes as long as he is sincere?"
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.240]   They say, "The curse of the past has been that people were so correct in their doctrine
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.720]   but they were not sincere.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.440]   They didn't put into practice what they believed, and that's the cause of the present
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   trouble."
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:44.480]   So the tendency now is to exalt sincerity and to exalt zeal and activity because of
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.400]   the terrible plight and position in which we find ourselves.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.280]   Then let me give you a third reason, which is not perhaps quite so applicable in this
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.480]   country as it is in the United States of America.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.360]   Now in America, some of the most acute and discerning and spiritually minded leaders
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   are very concerned about this position.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   In America, in contradistinction to this country, most of the churches are full on Sundays.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.880]   It is the thing to do to go to a place of worship in the United States, particularly
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   on Sunday morning.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.800]   Not so much Sunday evening, but Sunday morning.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   The churches are full, the churches are flourishing, the churches are prosperous.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.940]   But at the same time, the crime wave is increasing at an alarming rate.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.800]   All that a number, I say, of the best thinkers in the church in that country are beginning
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.160]   to say, "What have we got in our churches?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.040]   Is it Christianity or is it religion?
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   Is it the Christian faith or is it some kind of social club, a social activity and a social
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.080]   outlet?"
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.760]   They are becoming very concerned about this.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.440]   The churches are not only full, they have all sorts and kinds of institutions and organizations
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.320]   and clubs and they are all thriving and they are all busy.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   Their activity is quite amazing.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.520]   But at long last, many are asking the question, "What is the value of all this?
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.640]   Have we a right to be complacent?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.160]   Have we a right to say that everything is all right because the churches are full and
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   as they are full of activity?"
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.680]   They are beginning to see that you can have a so-called active church, brimming over with
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   people and with excitement and activity, and yet that your Christianity, if it is such,
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   is not really counting very much in the life of the nation and of the people at large.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.680]   Now, a number of books have been written about this very subject within the past months and
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.040]   there is an increasing concern being manifested with regard to this whole question.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.240]   Now then, it is in the light of all that I am calling attention to this question.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.800]   But as I say, my fundamental reason for doing so is the very way in which the apostle puts
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   it.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:11.840]   I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:21.920]   In other words, it is obvious that you can have a wrong zeal, that zeal may be mistaken,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.640]   that zeal may even be dangerous.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.200]   Now if you take the long history of the Christian church, you will find that very often a wrong
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.920]   or a false zeal has done very great harm.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.280]   I could give you examples.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.040]   Take the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.680]   Martin Luther, having seen the truth of justification by faith only, mainly through this epistle
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:57.120]   to the Romans, in a sense starts Protestantism, and all along he is having to fight against
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   Roman Catholicism.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.640]   And he had to wage a great battle against Roman Catholicism.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:11.200]   But quite soon he found himself engaged in another battle also, because certain people
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:19.640]   following in the wake of Luther, certain enthusiasts, certain fanatics, having got a taste of liberty,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.520]   turned it into license.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.040]   So that Luther, at the same time from there on, was not only fighting on the one front
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   against Roman Catholicism, he was having to fight against the fanatical Protestant sects
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.920]   that rose up on the other side.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.480]   And the reason he had for doing it was this, of course.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:44.600]   He could see very plainly that the excesses of the fanatics was in a sense a greater danger
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.520]   almost than Roman Catholicism itself.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.440]   At any rate, they were weakening his whole position and argument as over and against
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.320]   Roman Catholicism.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:00.040]   His great heart was greatly grieved by the excesses, and it was genuine, it was zealous,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.920]   it was sincere, of so many of these sects that arose suddenly, just immediately after
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.720]   the Reformation.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.160]   The same thing happened in this country in the seventeenth century, at the time of the
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.960]   great Puritan awakening and revival.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.840]   You remember that certain people arose that was the origin of the Quakers.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.640]   George Fox himself was a great and a good man, but there were others, men like the men
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.400]   called William Naylor, who belonged to the Quakers and who became quite fanatical, and
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   who rode on a horse into Bristol proclaiming that he was the Messiah.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.000]   Reformation came in, and so those of you who read the works of people like John Owen and
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.560]   Thomas Goodwin and Richard Baxter will know that they likewise were fighting on the two
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.560]   fronts.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.200]   They were not only fighting the dangerous tendencies they found in Anglicanism and in
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:00.960]   Roman Catholicism, they were having to fight these radical sects that arose and constituted
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.000]   a terrible danger to the whole of the Puritan movement.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.560]   Same thing again, and when you come to the next century you have the same thing.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:15.480]   Strangely enough, not deliberately, quite accidentally, I have been refreshing my memory
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.880]   on certain aspects of the evangelical awakening in America in the eighteenth century, the
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.920]   work of Jonathan Edwards and Whitefield.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.120]   But in reading that I have been reminded again of the havoc that was wrought in the churches
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:37.160]   of New England by a man of the name of James Davenport, who came in the wake of Whitefield,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.560]   but who was a fanatic and who carried everything to terrible excesses.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:47.800]   Full of zeal, the most honest, the most sincere men, but he did great harm to the cause of
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.920]   the revival in New England and caused much heart-searching and trouble for people like
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.880]   Jonathan Edwards and the other godly men who cooperated with him.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.800]   There is no doubt at all, but that it was the fanaticism of a man like James Davenport
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.440]   who did the greatest amount of damage to that great revival.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.840]   So that Whitefield, who had been received almost as an angel of God in 1742, when he
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:19.040]   went back to the same places in 1745, received a very cool reception, and even he was not
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.800]   able to do much by way of bringing the masses of the people to a knowledge of salvation.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.120]   Now then, there you see is the kind of reason for examining this whole question very carefully.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.160]   And if ever it was necessary to do so, it is necessary to do so tonight.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.760]   Now then, fortunately for us, the apostle puts it in the two verses.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.200]   True zeal, false zeal.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.680]   How can I tell the difference?
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.760]   Well, in the first verse you've got true zeal.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.120]   "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved."
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   That's the true zeal.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:04.360]   Verse two, "I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.080]   That is false zeal.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.640]   Very well, let's look at this.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   Let's see now something about the dangers of false zeal.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:23.520]   First of all, let us look at the fallacy of setting up zeal or sincerity to the supreme
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.080]   position.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.640]   The fallacy of saying that if a man's sincere, if he's all out, if he's zealous, it doesn't
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.760]   matter what he believes.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.680]   How common that position is today.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.880]   Now let me show you how wrong that is and why it's wrong.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.720]   The first reason for saying that it's wrong is that it's to misunderstand altogether
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.560]   the nature of zeal or of sincerity.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.440]   What is zeal?
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.320]   What is sincerity?
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.240]   The answer is, it is nothing but a form of power.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's a kind of motive force.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.040]   That's what zeal really is.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.600]   It's a measure of the energy with which a man does anything.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   Now that is precisely what zeal means.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.400]   The obvious comparison is, zeal to a man is like fire.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.880]   Fire is a form of energy or electricity, if you like.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   It's energy.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   Now therefore, because that is what it is, you must never regard it as something in and
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.000]   of itself.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.240]   You must never put it into the supreme position.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.600]   If you like it in another way, take it like this.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.640]   Man has a mind and he has a heart and he has a will.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.000]   Now zeal belongs entirely to the realm of the will.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.160]   And because it belongs to the realm of the will, as I'm going to show you, it should
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.840]   never be put up on its own, it should never be regarded as the supreme thing.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.680]   Therefore it is always wrong to say that if a man is zealous or sincere, he must be right,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.600]   and that if you do something, anything, it's better than doing nothing.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   It doesn't follow.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.160]   Now I could illustrate this to you in many different ways.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:28.600]   Take for instance that proverb of ours which puts it so perfectly, "Fire is a good servant
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   but a bad master."
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.120]   Now there it is in a nutshell.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.340]   Fire is a good servant but it's a terrible master.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.840]   If you control your fire, you can heat your house, you can cook your food, you can do
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.960]   many other things, drive your steam engines and so on.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.640]   Fire is a most excellent servant.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.800]   But you let fire get in control, and there's nothing but disaster.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.360]   It'll burn down your house, it'll ruin your great buildings, it may ruin a whole
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.120]   countryside, it may burn up a prairie and destroy crops.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.200]   Fire is a good servant but a bad master.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.520]   It's never meant to be a master.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.400]   It was only meant to be a servant.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.920]   And this is something which is true.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:19.280]   However, generally you may apply it with regard to zeal or with regard to sincerity.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.760]   And it is the answer ultimately to this whole argument which says, "Well, we must do
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   something at any rate."
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   I can't recall whether I've ever told you of an incident which I witnessed myself
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.680]   when I was quite a boy.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.360]   It was a house that went on fire.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.200]   And it went on fire in the middle of the night in a village where there was no fire brigade
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.320]   or anyone anywhere, no fire brigade anywhere near.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.040]   And suddenly the whole thing began to blaze.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.120]   There were the men of the village trying to see what could be done.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.520]   But suddenly they discovered the village blacksmith engaged in an occupation.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.440]   And this is what he was doing.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.720]   I can illustrate it perfectly.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.120]   The front part of that building, there were pillars supporting a great iron girder.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.600]   And on that girder a great wall was built up.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.160]   The men of the village suddenly found that the blacksmith had gone to his smithy and
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.840]   he'd brought out his biggest hammer.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   And there they caught him just in time.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   He was hammering away with all his might and men on one of these pillars, holding up that
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.720]   great girder on which the whole wall was built.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.000]   He was hitting it with all his might.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.240]   And they said to him, "What are you doing?"
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Well, he said, "I'm trying to get this down."
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.360]   They said, "What are you doing that for?"
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.040]   He didn't know.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.480]   But he felt it was a good thing to do.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.760]   And there he was hitting away at these pillars.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.440]   Of course, had he succeeded, the result would have been that large numbers of people would
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.560]   probably have been killed who were standing in the road.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.000]   If the pillars had been demolished, down would have come this great iron girder and the whole
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.400]   of the wall down with it.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.560]   And the people would have been killed.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.520]   Now here was a man, you see, who felt it was right to do something.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.040]   He was working very hard.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.760]   He was hitting with all his might and men.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.720]   But thank God he was stopped just in time.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   He was very zealous.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.160]   He was very sincere.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.280]   He was using a great deal of energy.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.880]   That's the answer to the statement that at any rate they're doing something.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.920]   They're not like those other people who are doing nothing.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   They're doing something.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.960]   As if to do something is always right.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:42.480]   There are times when to do something is very wrong and can be the high road to disaster.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   Very well.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.240]   There is the answer to that.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.600]   In other words, we must learn that zeal and sincerity are neutral.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   They're neutral in and of themselves.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.400]   They're never meant to be in the most prominent position.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.800]   It's meant to be servant.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.040]   Indeed I can go further.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.560]   Zeal is quite often a matter of temperament.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   There are some people who are more zealous than others.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.600]   There are some people who are quiet and lethargic and phlegmatic.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.640]   They do their work but they do it like that.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.760]   There are others who are zealous, full of energy and of power.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   No, it's no credit to them.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.040]   They're born like that.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:28.400]   And very often zeal and sincerity are but natural temperamental qualities.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.360]   But people don't realize that.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.400]   They don't see that they're zealous because they were born zealous.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.960]   They think they're zealous because they're Christians.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.320]   It's a very subtle point.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.880]   That's why we've got to go on with this examination.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.120]   Well there's my first point then.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.360]   That's the nature of zeal and of sincerity.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:56.800]   But secondly, you will find, I think almost invariably, that zeal is one of the most prominent
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.040]   characteristics of people who belong to the cults.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.920]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.160]   The members of cults are generally most zealous people.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.960]   Don't you find them coming round to your doors on Saturday afternoons selling books?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.680]   Are Christian people as zealous as that?
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:21.240]   Here are people who give their time, their energy and their money to the propagation
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.160]   of what they believe.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.800]   And they're prepared to make great sacrifices for it.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.440]   And they do so.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.040]   You get the same kind of zeal and sincerity shown amongst communists.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.880]   Look how assiduous they are in trying to gain converts to their point of view.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.840]   How they propagate it, how they'll give time, how they'll take terrible risks, perhaps
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.040]   the risk of losing their position and many other things.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.640]   How zealous the communists are.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.720]   That's how they've succeeded in such an amazing manner in this present century.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.880]   They didn't hold public meetings.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.100]   They were not allowed to.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.800]   They never had mass meetings.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.520]   It's been done quietly by what they call cellular infiltration.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.920]   Each man feeling that he's a missionary to propagate his teaching.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.920]   And they've done so.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.680]   And during the war, you remember, we used to read about certain Japanese pilots who
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.440]   were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the Emperor.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.440]   They believed in Emperor worship.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.360]   This Harry Carrier, as it was called.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.720]   They were ready to die for their cause.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   They were so zealous.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.640]   They were so sincere in it.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.160]   Now, surely this needs to engage our attention.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:33.520]   It is one of the main characteristics of the cults and their devotees that they are characterized
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:41.000]   by an amazing and an astonishing zeal and sincerity in the propagation of what they
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   believe.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   Now, that in itself shows us why this subject needs to be examined.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.560]   But I go to my third and my last argument at this point.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:58.480]   The apostle tells us here that it is actually possible for a man to have a zeal of God and
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.040]   still to be wrong.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.480]   Terribly wrong.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.720]   Tragically wrong.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.520]   Now, you see, this isn't merely a question of a blacksmith.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.720]   It's no longer a question of a member of a cult.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.960]   A man can have a zeal for God and still be totally wrong.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.840]   That he says was the trouble with the Jews.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:27.000]   But listen to our Lord putting this in some terrifying words which he uses in the 23rd
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.060]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew in verse 15.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.360]   This is what our Lord says about the Pharisees.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.960]   "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Listen.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.560]   "For you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.080]   twofold more the child of hell than yourselves."
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   That zeal.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:58.780]   "Compass sea and land to make one convert, one proselyte."
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.120]   There was no end to their zeal.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.840]   The apostle Paul puts exactly the same point in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.760]   Galatians where he is dealing with these Pharisees and others amongst the Jews who were opposing
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   his work.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   Listen to him.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.480]   Galatians 4, 17 and 18.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:21.040]   "They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you that ye might
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   affect them.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   But it is good," says the apostle, "to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.240]   and not only when I am present with you."
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.880]   Again he is paying tribute to their zeal.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.920]   They zealously affect you.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.520]   They were most sincere and most zealous and most thoroughgoing in their endeavors to influence
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.120]   these Galatians, but they were all wrong.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.640]   They were not zealously affecting them in a good thing, but in a bad thing.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.760]   And our reading at the beginning in the 26th of Acts has reminded us how this was once
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.040]   true of the apostle Paul himself.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Acts 26, 9.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.400]   "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.240]   Jesus of Nazareth, which things I also did in Jerusalem.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   There was never a more sincere man than Saul of Tarsus.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.360]   I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.880]   exceedingly mad against them.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.720]   There you are, you can't have greater zeal than that.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.880]   I persecuted them even unto strange cities."
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.240]   And you remember how setting out on that famous journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, he went
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.640]   breathing out threatenings and slaughter.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:44.960]   The world has never seen a more zealous, sincere person than Saul of Tarsus going down to Damascus.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:53.360]   But it was altogether and entirely wrong, absolutely mistaken.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.960]   And he puts it again in Philippians 3.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   6.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.000]   "Concerning zeal, persecuting the church."
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.240]   He said, "If it's a matter of zeal, I beat everybody."
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.360]   Circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.160]   of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.880]   Concerning zeal, persecuting the church.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.720]   Touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.920]   There was never a more zealous and sincere man than Saul of Tarsus.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.040]   But you see, he came to see how tragically and terribly wrong it all was.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.560]   And so he was constantly making this point in his teaching later on.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.360]   So he puts it in 2 Timothy 3.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   6.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.200]   Like this, he says, "Of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:50.960]   women laden with sins, led away with diverse lusts, ever learning and never able to come
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   to the knowledge of the truth."
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.960]   And again in 2 Timothy 4.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   3.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.760]   "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:10.320]   lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.440]   their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables."
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   That's it.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   Well, very well then.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:25.120]   You see, the apostle's teaching is that you can have even a zeal of God and yet be altogether
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.760]   and entirely wrong.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.440]   So there's only one conclusion to draw.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.480]   Zeal must therefore always be tested.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.400]   It must always be examined.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.120]   You don't say, "What a wonderful zealous man that is.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.600]   He must be right because he's zealous.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.760]   How sincere he is.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   He must be right.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.920]   Who am I to question him?"
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.840]   That is the most dangerous thing you can ever say.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.680]   The whole of this teaching in the New Testament, our Lord and the apostles urges us to be careful,
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:31:01.240]   to warn the whole case of the Jews, is a standing warning against trusting to a zeal for God,
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.160]   but not according to knowledge.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.280]   Very well.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.640]   So that I come to my second main heading, which is this.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   What then are the characteristics of false zeal?
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.280]   If I've got to examine zeal, if I'm told that I can have a false zeal as well as a true
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:26.120]   zeal because zeal itself is neutral, how can I test whether my zeal is true or false?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.720]   We are therefore committed to an examination of the characteristics of false zeal.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.880]   And here are some of them.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.320]   First, these are not absolute tests.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.880]   You've got to take them together.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.400]   You'll have an element of some of them in many different cases.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:51.640]   Here is one thing which should always raise a query in our minds, and that is that our
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:32:01.480]   zeal has been imposed upon us by somebody else, and we are just conforming to a pattern.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.240]   That is, of course, a characteristic of the cult's always.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.280]   You see, the case is put before you, and if you are persuaded, you take it up, and then
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.160]   you begin to be like all the rest of them, and they're all the same.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.560]   But you see, that is a zeal, I say, that is imposed upon you.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.280]   You're conforming to a pattern.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.520]   You're becoming one of them, and you become exactly like the rest of them.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   They're all the same.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.160]   It's an imposed pattern.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   That should always raise a query in our minds.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:36.600]   Secondly, if it is a zeal that has to be whipped up, or organized as it were, or that we have
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:45.000]   to be kept up to it, it is good presumptive evidence that it may well be a false zeal.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.280]   I mean particularly if the stimulus has to come from other people on the outside all
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.040]   along.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.720]   It may very well be a false zeal.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.480]   Then another very important point is this one, my third test.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:06.200]   If you find that you put greater emphasis upon doing than upon being, it's always
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.280]   an indication that you should be careful.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.440]   If you are more anxious to do things than to be a saint, you better examine your zeal
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.880]   again.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:24.400]   The false zeal always puts its emphasis upon the doing, and is not very interested in being.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.200]   Hence its dangers.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.160]   Or another way of putting that, my fourth test can be put in this form, that in false
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:41.800]   zeal the activity is always very prominent and at the center of the life, rather than
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.520]   the truth.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   The thing you're hit by all along is the activity, this energy that's being put forth,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:56.240]   rather than by the truth, which even the people themselves claim to be representing.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.320]   In other words, there's always a tendency in false zeal to overdo things.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.800]   There's always an element of excess.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   The activity is more in evidence than the thing which it is claimed that has called
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   it forth.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:19.880]   Or, if you like, in the fifth place, the more prominent the machinery and the element of
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:26.600]   organization, the more likely is it to be a false zeal.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:35.960]   When methods and means and organization and machinery and mechanism are very prominent,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.160]   it's good presumptive evidence that it is a false zeal.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:47.760]   But as my sixth test, I would group a number of things together under the heading of carnality.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.160]   I mean by that the flesh.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   What do I mean?
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:00.520]   Well, in false zeal there is always this carnal element, and it shows itself quite often by
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   a kind of likeness, likeness of spirit, almost sometimes even a frivolity.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.960]   Alas, this can sometimes be seen even in religious meetings.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.200]   There's a likeness and a joviality, and a kind of jovial superficiality.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.040]   You can't imagine such things anywhere near the Apostle Paul or any other of the Apostles
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.640]   or anywhere near our blessed Lord himself.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   But you get it in these meetings.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   They're very zealous.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.080]   I'm not queering their zeal.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.400]   I'm granting their zeal.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.480]   I'm granting their enthusiasm.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.160]   But they always overdo it, and there is this light touch about it.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:49.480]   Indeed, I have often, on some occasions, in a certain type of meeting, I've had to remind
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.840]   myself that I am in a religious meeting.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:58.000]   The spirit I have felt present has been the spirit of a cricket team or a football team,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.920]   the spirit of doing something worldly, some worldly entertainment.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.480]   Now the people were absolutely sincere, but there was a likeness in the atmosphere.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   There was no sense of awe, no sense of God, no sense of holiness, no sense of reverence.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.520]   But everything was bright and breezy.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:18.320]   It was being carried along with good verve and wonderful organizing power.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.280]   I say these are indications of carnality and not of true zeal.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:30.560]   So that you can add to that, whenever there is a good deal of excitement, this is still
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.000]   under carnality.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Excitement is generally fleshly.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And if there is an element of self-confidence and of assurance and of being in control of
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.960]   the situation, you can be quite certain it is falsely.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   Any impression that is given by a man, I don't care how zealous he is, I don't care how sincere
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:59.280]   he is, if he gives that impression that he is in control and self-confident and assured,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.560]   I am suspicious of his zeal and of his sincerity.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:09.720]   If there is any suspicion at all of his being proud of himself, it is still worse.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.640]   But let's go on to test number seven.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:19.280]   False zeal is always impatient of examination.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.120]   It dislikes being examined.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   It dislikes being questioned.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   It resents this.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.320]   It says, "But can't you see that I am zealous?
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   I am enthusiastic.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   I am sincere.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320]   I want to do it."
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.920]   But you say, "Well, but let's make sure because of the teaching of the scriptures."
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   No, no.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   It is impatient of all that.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   It wants to get on with things.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   It must be doing something.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.920]   It is this doing of something, instead of sitting down with the world on fire.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.320]   It is impatient of any examination.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.760]   That is surely a very bad sign.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.880]   And when it is impatient of teaching, it is still worse.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.720]   They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.080]   They don't want the knowledge, says Paul.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   They have rejected the knowledge.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.840]   They are not interested in it.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.400]   They must get on with it, they say.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   And they don't want to be taught.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   And teaching is unnecessary.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.840]   The thing to do is to be doing something.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.080]   That is the spirit of the false zeal.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.920]   Test number nine.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:28.840]   Fanaticism, intolerance, concern with success of what it is propagating primarily, rather
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.800]   than concerned about being true.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.480]   So I put as my tenth test, a lack of balance.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.320]   You will generally find that people who are animated by a false zeal see one thing only,
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.300]   one aspect of the truth only, and they are not interested in anything else.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.400]   It may be evangelism only, it may be Calvinism only, it may be Arminianism only, it may be
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   prophecy only.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.300]   This is the one thing, and with all their might and zeal, they press this one thing,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.560]   and they are not interested in anything else.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.000]   That is always a fatal sign.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.200]   That has always been the trouble with heretics.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.400]   Heretics have lost their balance.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.920]   A heretic is a man who has become so absorbed and taken up by one thing that he sees nothing
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.600]   else, and he so presses this one thing.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.360]   He not only loses his balance, it becomes a lie.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.520]   It is blind zeal, and zeal can be blind.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.280]   It can be blinding.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:31.040]   So if there is any evidence of a lack of balance, if the fullness of the truth is not being
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   presented, if the whole counsel of God is not being dealt with, but always hammering
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.160]   away on the one thing, this one thing, nothing else matters.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.320]   Not interested in learning, not interested in doctrine, not interested in theology, must
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.720]   think of people saved and nothing else, or the man who is not interested in getting people
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.680]   saved, but he has one particular aspect of doctrine, and he is always on it.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.160]   He is certain to find it whenever he speaks or writes, always comes out.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.160]   That is a false zeal.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.680]   It is a lack of balance.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.480]   Or any lack of balance, of course, is between doctrine and life.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.520]   What a man believes and teaches and the way he lives, that of course is of necessity proof
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.480]   positive that it is a false zeal.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:17.200]   So my last test is this one, my eleventh test.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.600]   The man who has got a false zeal is always a restless person, and he is restless for
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.760]   this reason, that he is living on his own activity.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:32.280]   He is living on his zeal, his energy, his enthusiasm, and his own sincerity.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.840]   And that will never give a man peace.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.040]   And they show it, of course, in this way.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.200]   If they are taken ill and cannot do things, they do not know where they are.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.080]   They become depressed, they are unhappy.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.440]   They then realize that they have been living on their own activity.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.400]   God knows, my dear friends, I am preaching as much to you as I am to myself.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.740]   I have known preachers, our less, who have lived on their own preaching.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.120]   I have seen some tragedies.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.640]   I have seen old men who have been a lifetime in the ministry, unhappy when they could no
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.720]   longer preach.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.000]   Not because they were not unhappy because they could not preach, but they were unhappy
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   in themselves.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.240]   They have been living on their preaching instead of living on the Lord and living on the truth.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.160]   It is a terrible danger for any man in the ministry.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.400]   It is a danger for any man who is active in the Christian life.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:23.000]   Let us be certain we are not living on our own activities, because if we are, we have
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.520]   a false zeal.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   It is of no value.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.080]   You can be indefatigable, you can be assiduous, you can really give yourself, but it is all
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:37.600]   wrong if it leaves you in this position in which you are restless and feel lost if you
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.200]   can no longer be active.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.600]   Well, there I suggest to you I generate us some of the more important tests by which
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.520]   you can discover whether your zeal is false or not.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.360]   But let me turn to the other side.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.440]   What are the characteristics of a true zeal?
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.240]   The answer is, of course, it is more or less the exact opposite of what I have been saying,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.440]   but let me put it in this form.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.360]   A true zeal is never a zeal that is put on.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.520]   It is not put on by anybody else.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.960]   It is not put on by you yourself.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.560]   If you have got a true zeal, you have got it not because you have been told it is the
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.360]   thing to do when you join this church or this society, whatever it is.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.440]   No, no, that is not the reason.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.600]   If you are doing it simply because it is the thing to do in this society or company, it
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.240]   is probably false.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.720]   That is never true of the true zeal.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.320]   It is never put on mechanically, either by other people or the thing to do, or by ourselves
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   as the result of a decision.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.680]   Secondly, it is always the result of being.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.760]   The man who has got a true zeal has it because he is what he is.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.840]   He has it because he has grown in grace and because he has grown in sanctification.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:59.560]   He acts because he is what he is.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:07.400]   Or thirdly, and putting it still more specifically, and in terms of our text, true zeal is always
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.240]   the result of knowledge.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   It is always the outcome of knowledge.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.160]   Now the Apostle is really put this very wonderfully for us already in chapter 6 in verse 17,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:29.800]   where he said this, "But God bethanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:37.240]   obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you."
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.120]   Now you notice the order.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:45.000]   He actually puts the obeying first, but the obeying actually in practice was the last.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.480]   This is what he says has happened to you.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.240]   You were the servants of sin.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.360]   What has happened to you?
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:55.720]   Well, he says, the first thing was this, a form of doctrine was delivered to you.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:05.000]   The gospel was preached to them, and they received it and believed it with their minds.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.920]   But it was not only in their minds.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.960]   The heart was involved.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.680]   They were moved by it.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   And because the heart was involved and they were moved by it, they gave it obedience,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.240]   their will came into action.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.680]   But that was the order.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.880]   They received it with the mind, it moved the heart, it moved them to action.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.360]   Now that is the true order always.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.440]   And the trouble with a false zeal is that it puts the will first and is not interested
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.360]   even in the heart nor in the head.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.160]   The man who says nothing matters but doing something, he's dismissing the mind.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.920]   He's dismissing the heart.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.520]   He says nothing matters but activity, the will.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.640]   That's the danger of activism always.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.800]   It doesn't know what it's doing.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.400]   It isn't interested in what it's doing.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.920]   That's the thing.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.240]   And it rushes and goes on in its headlong blind manner.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.920]   The right order is the mind, the heart, the will.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.760]   The will should never be approached directly.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.560]   Whenever you approach the will directly, you are in danger of producing and creating a
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.160]   false zeal.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.840]   The man who has the true zeal, he knows what he's doing and he knows why he's doing it.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.000]   His zeal is according to knowledge.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.920]   So that the fourth test is this, that it is a deep zeal, not superficial.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.720]   There's a depth about it.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.080]   It's not a spectacular, not a showy.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.820]   You get a much bigger blaze if you put a match into shavings than if you put it into a lump
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.820]   of coal.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.820]   Terrible blaze, but it's soon over, finished.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.720]   The coal isn't so spectacular, but you get a better fire and it lasts longer and it does
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.200]   more useful service.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.960]   There's a depth about the true zeal and there's a control about it.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.680]   If zeal is in control, as I say, it's like fire.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.040]   It's a bad master.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:56.480]   But when zeal is controlled by knowledge, it's as it should be, it's true zeal.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.160]   And therefore it follows that there are certain characteristics which once more are the exact
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.920]   opposite of carnality.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:12.480]   The man with a true zeal is never self-confident, never, never self-confident.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.640]   He is always reverent, he doesn't get excited in a false sense.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.360]   He's a man who depreciates himself.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.360]   The Apostle Paul says to the Corinthians that when he went amongst them he did so in weakness
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.480]   and in fear and in much trembling.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:37.360]   Paul trembling, apprehensive, fearful, nervous as it were.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.680]   How different that is from the false zeal and the confidence and the assurance and the
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.240]   mastery of the occasion.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.440]   No, no, weakness, fear, much trembling.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.760]   He was greatly used.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.400]   So he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 10, "I labored more abundantly than they all."
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.440]   But wait a minute.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:04.560]   Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.480]   The Corinthians were despising Paul because he wasn't boasting about himself.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.080]   Some of the false teachers were boasting about themselves.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.700]   They were recommending themselves as he says in the 2nd Epistle, chapter 3.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.680]   And because Paul was a humble, modest man who didn't advertise what he was doing, they
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.320]   said he's a nobody.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.640]   His speech is contemptible.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.760]   Presence is weak and his speech contemptible.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   What did he do?
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.680]   Well, says Paul, if you really want to know, I labored more abundantly than they all.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.920]   Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.280]   I am what I am by the grace of God.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.680]   What's the motive that animates true zeal?
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.840]   Well, it isn't just to be busy and to do things and to get results.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.000]   It's the glory of God.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.880]   The glory of God.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.480]   The love of Christ constraineth me.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.520]   That's it.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.880]   Not because he's an active fellow, not full of zeal and enthusiasm and energy.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   No, no, the glory of God.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.680]   The love of Christ.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.560]   His concern about the condition of the lost, seeing their destiny, seeing them as hell-bound
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   sinners.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.760]   He doesn't talk libly-like about souls being saved.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.880]   He realizes the condition of the lost and is desperate, it's serious, it's alarming,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.240]   it's terrifying.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.360]   And that is why he's engaged as he is.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.600]   It's his knowledge of truth.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.480]   And he's not simply anxious that people should decide for Christ.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:40.320]   He wants them to come to what Paul calls a knowledge of the truth.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.880]   He's not interested in superficial results, but he is very concerned that men and women
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.740]   should have a knowledge of the truth that will save them from hell and bring them to
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:56.840]   a knowledge of the glory of God and make them heirs of eternal bliss.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.180]   Those are his motives.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:08.400]   So that ultimately it comes to this, that the man who is animated by a true zeal, however
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.800]   successful he may be, he is never elated.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.580]   He's never excited with his own success.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.700]   He is a man who has taken to heart the words that were uttered by our Lord himself to the
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.380]   seventy when he sent them out to preach and to cast out devils, and they were so successful
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.180]   that they came back full of excitement.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.540]   And they said, "Master, the very devils are made subject unto us."
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.900]   And our Lord looked at them and said, "In this rejoice not that the devils or the spirits
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:47.980]   are made subject unto you, but rejoice rather that your names are written in heaven."
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.860]   And that is the position of the man who has this true zeal.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:57.020]   He thanks God that he's been used and that God has deigned to bless his puny efforts.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.340]   But the thing in which he rejoices is not the results he's had, but that his name is
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.540]   written in heaven.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.980]   So at the end of his life, this is what he says with the Apostle Paul in 2 Timothy chapter
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:16.860]   4, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:23.740]   I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:31.020]   Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:36.700]   judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but also unto them all that love
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.700]   is appearing."
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.180]   That's the thing he's interested in.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:48.700]   With all his great and phenomenal success, this is what he says, "That I may know him
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:53.660]   and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.020]   unto his death.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:51:00.460]   If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from the dead, not as though I had already
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:07.300]   attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.860]   for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:17.220]   Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:22.940]   things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:31.020]   toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.260]   That's the man with the true zeal.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:41.380]   His desire is not to be successful primarily, but to know the Lord and to be like him and
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.140]   to apprehend him with a greater fullness.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.500]   That's a most wonderful test.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.100]   Very well, we must leave it at this.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:54.380]   I apologize for having held you, but I wanted to deal with this subject.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.140]   Shall I ask you a question as I close?
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:02.500]   What's the effect of all this upon you?
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:07.700]   Is it that you are so afraid of a false zeal that you do nothing at all?
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.740]   If it is, I have spoken in vain.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:17.140]   If you are so afraid of a false zeal that it paralyzes you, you are the very antithesis
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:23.460]   of Paul, you have not understood the truth.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:31.100]   The knowledge of the truth always moves the heart and moves the will.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.380]   You have obeyed from the heart that form of sound doctrine which was delivered to you.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.820]   If it's only in your mind, my dear friend, examine yourself.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.300]   There's something wrong with you.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.740]   If the knowledge of the truth hasn't moved you, hasn't engaged your affections and
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:54.220]   your emotions, hasn't made you do something, you haven't known the truth properly.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:58.180]   When a man really knows this truth, he says, "We cannot but speak of the things which
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.200]   we have seen and heard."
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:05.100]   When the early Christians, the ordinary people, were scattered out of Jerusalem by a persecution,
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:10.620]   I read of them that they went everywhere preaching the word, not in pulpits, but telling everybody
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   whom they met.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.620]   Why?
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.300]   Because it was so wonderful, it was so glorious, what it had done for them, and they were anxious
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.780]   for everybody else to have it.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.980]   In any case, the apostle teaches us in Romans 12, 11, that we mustn't be slothful in business.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.900]   We must rather be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.660]   Not a false zeal, but a true one.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.700]   Fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.660]   He's not writing to apostles, he's writing to ordinary church members.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.740]   Are you fervent in spirit?
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.660]   Are you moved by what you claim to believe?
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.060]   Do you really believe it?
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.260]   If you do, you know that everybody who doesn't believe it is going to hell.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:54:01.380]   And can you be passive and quiet and paralyzed and say nothing and do nothing?
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.060]   You are here from different churches tonight, my friends.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:09.380]   How often do you take strangers to your place of worship, that they may hear the gospel?
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.740]   To what extent are you concerned about the souls of the lost?
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.620]   How can a man believe this gospel and not be concerned about those who don't?
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:21.900]   How can a man sit down, feeling his own pulse, worrying about his own temptations and sins
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.700]   and problems, and have no concern about the lost?
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.260]   He doesn't know the truth, that's his trouble.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:34.340]   A man who knows the truth must be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:37.020]   I'm not just asking you to get up and rush and do something.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.940]   What I'm saying is this, that if you're paralyzed and are doing nothing, what you
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.780]   need is the spirit.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.080]   You can't make your own spirit fervent.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.420]   If you try to, it'll be a false zeal.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.100]   The Holy Spirit alone can make a man fervent.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.740]   It is the fire from the altar of heaven that alone can burn in the heart and give a man
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.700]   a concern for the lost and make him do something about the lost.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.780]   That's what you need.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.460]   You need the baptism of the Spirit of God.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.860]   You need the fire of the Spirit.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.460]   And you should give yourself no rest nor peace until you've got it.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.700]   Horatius Burner was a man who believed Romans 9.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.220]   He believed in the sovereign election of God.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.660]   But we've been singing his hymn tonight.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.440]   Do you remember it?
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.700]   This new hymn book of ours has left out two verses.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.980]   I wonder why.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.860]   These are the two verses they've left out.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.860]   Listen.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.420]   "Go, Liberon, while it is day.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.420]   The world's dark night is hastening on.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.860]   Speed, speed thy work.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.460]   Cast loathe away.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.820]   It is not thus that souls are one."
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.820]   That's been left out.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.700]   Perhaps they no longer believe that.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.900]   Here's another verse they've left out.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:54.820]   "Men die in darkness at thy side without a hope to cheer the tomb.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.580]   Take up the torch and wave it wide.
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:03.540]   The torch that lights time's thickest bloom."
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.540]   They left that out.
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.980]   They probably don't believe that either now.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   But Horatius Burner believed it, and it's true.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.580]   They're dying in darkness, and they're going to hell.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.420]   Take up the torch of the gospel.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.100]   Wave it that they may see it.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:22.740]   "Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.940]   For toil comes rest, for exile home.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:34.900]   Soon shalt thou hear the bridegroom's voice, the midnight peal.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.540]   Behold, I come."
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.700]   And what a wonderful thing it'll be if he says to you when he sees you, "Well done, thou
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:49.580]   good and faithful servant."
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.940]   God grant that it may be so.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.820]   Amen.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.740]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
