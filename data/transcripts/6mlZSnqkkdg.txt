[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   "â€¦call your attention this evening to be found in that chapter we read at the beginning,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.500]   namely the first chapter in the first epistle of Paul to Timothy, and reading again the
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.580]   eleventh verse, the eleventh verse in the first chapter of Paul's first epistle to
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.640]   Timothy, 'According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.200]   my trust.'" Now, that's the end of a statement. The statement really begins at verse 8, where
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.120]   the apostle says this, "But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.480]   knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.280]   for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.640]   murderers of mothers, for men-slayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   with mankind, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.800]   other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.840]   God, which was committed to my trust." "According to" means "in accordance with," or, if
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.280]   you prefer it, "as is taught in the glorious gospel of the blessed God."
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.160]   Now, here we are looking at this definition of the gospel given us by this great preacher,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   apostle, and evangelist known as the Apostle Paul. He regards it as a great privilege.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   He says, "This has been committed to my trust, and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord," he says,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.600]   "who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.800]   who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious. But I obtained mercy because
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.200]   I did it ignorantly in unbelief." He was, of course, a Jew and a Pharisee, and he heard
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.320]   about Jesus of Nazareth, and he hated everything he heard. He heard about his teaching and
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.960]   reviled it, and then he heard the report about his resurrection and was scandalized by it,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.680]   as were the other Pharisees. But you know the story, how on the road to Damascus, when
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.760]   he was going down from Jerusalem to Damascus to exterminate a little church, gathering
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.120]   a church of Christians, gathering in Damascus, he saw the risen Lord on the way, and his
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.480]   whole life was entirely changed, and he became a preacher of this gospel. That's what he
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.840]   means by saying this, that this is committed to him, and he thanks God for it, that he
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.720]   of everybody who had been such a bitter opponent of it and a blasphemer of God and of Christ
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.260]   should ever have been made a preacher of the gospel. But now, this is the thing in which
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.720]   he bursts, this message, this gospel that has been committed to him. And this is how
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.520]   he here describes it. It is the glorious gospel of the blessed God, or you may prefer the
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   way some people translate it, the gospel of the glory of the blessed God. Well, he comes
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   to much the same thing. Now, the question I want to discuss with you tonight is this.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.200]   Why does the apostle describe the gospel like this? Why does he suddenly call it the glorious
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.120]   gospel, or the gospel of the glory of the blessed God? Well, the context, I think, will
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.100]   have answered the question for you. He does it in order that he may emphasize the character
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:52.920]   of this gospel, and especially by way of contrast with what certain other people were saying
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.080]   was the gospel. Listen to him, this is how he puts it. "I besought thee," he said, "to
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, I besought thee that thou mightest charge
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.200]   some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.600]   which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in Christ." Then he says,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   "From which some, the gospel from which some having swerved, have turned aside to
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.200]   vain jangling, desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.860]   nor whereof they affirm." Now then, he is contrasting the gospel as it really is with
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.820]   this message that was being preached by these other people, some of them teaching a vague
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.560]   kind of pantheism, some of them preaching some odd sort of mysticism, fables and endless
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.260]   genealogies and raising lots of discussions and arguments and wranglings, and others preaching
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.300]   the law and saying that what mattered was that one should be circumcised and so on,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.100]   and were concerned about details and minutiae of the law, and they said, "This is the
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:16.140]   true gospel." Now the great apostle had heard this, and he writes in order to protest
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.340]   against it and in order to correct it. And what he seems to object to most of all about
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.100]   these false teachers was not merely that they were teaching something that was wrong, but
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.260]   that they were reducing this great and wonderful gospel, taking the glory out of it, missing
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.980]   the thrill and the wonder of it all, and thereby completely misrepresenting it. Now that is
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.700]   why he puts it like this. "Oh, these people," he said, "talking about these things, arguing
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.980]   and wrangling, they don't know what they're talking about, they don't really understand,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.300]   but they say that's the gospel. Some detail, some minutiae, some little matters that they're
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.780]   interested in." And he says, "They're taking the glory out of the gospel. It isn't a gospel.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.860]   There's nothing glorious about that. It's so small, it's so finicky." The gospel itself,
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.980]   on the other hand, he says, "is something that is magnificent and wonderful, the glorious
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.780]   gospel of the blessed God. It is the most wonderful thing in the world."
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.820]   Well, now, it's in order that I may convey that message to you, that I'm calling your
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.180]   attention to this matter this evening. Nothing is more important than that we should know
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.940]   what this gospel really is. And unfortunately, the modern world is very much like the world
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.940]   of that first century. There are, again, tragic misrepresentations of the gospel. And what
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.540]   one wants to say about them is, all of them, is that apart from anything else, there is
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.940]   no glory in their gospel. What is the gospel? What is Christianity to so many tonight? Well,
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.820]   there are many who seem to be reducing it simply to a question of politics. They've
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.940]   been doing a lot of that in this present century. They regard Our Lord as nothing but a kind
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:13.620]   of political reformer. Christianity to them is nothing but some sort of glorified socialism,
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.780]   social gospel, if you like. That is their idea of Christianity, they say. That is the
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.220]   message. So that the business of the preacher is to be talking about wages and housing and
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.660]   war and bombs and dealing with political matters, either in this country or in other countries.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.260]   They think that's Christianity. They think that that is the message of Christianity.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.380]   And there's only one answer to give to that. There's no glory in it. There's nothing
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.060]   wonderful. There's nothing amazing about it. Then there are others, you see, who make
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.780]   of it merely a matter of moral behavior and of ethics, that Christianity is nothing but
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.120]   a message which tells us to live a good life, not to do certain things and to take up other
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.580]   things, and a gospel of good works, and we must strive to do them and imitate others
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.740]   who do them and so on, and that that is Christianity, that it's nothing but a great moral appeal
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.060]   to us, so that they think the business of preaching is always to be denouncing various
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.620]   things, and that we should spend our time probably here tonight, therefore, in talking
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:29.340]   about juvenile delinquency and various moral problems that are obvious and prominent in
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.340]   the life of this country tonight, that we just talk about them and appeal to people
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.100]   to live a better life and try and get Acts of Parliament that are going to improve things
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.620]   and always make our protests and so on. They think that's the gospel.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:50.740]   Well, all I am concerned to say is this. Where is the glory in all that? Where is the thrill
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.060]   in all that? Is there anything in all that that would make a man cry out to the Apostle
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.500]   Paul and say, "The glorious gospel of the blessed God"? No. The trouble is, with
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:10.420]   all these misrepresentations of the gospel, is that they detract the glory out of it,
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.740]   and the wonder and the amazement and this thrilling element that is so prominent, as
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.220]   I was trying to show last Sunday night, in the whole of the New Testament presentation
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.740]   of this gospel of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:33.220]   Now then, in other words, the first point which we make about this gospel is this, that
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.300]   it is characterized above everything else by this sense of glory and of wonder. It's
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.620]   different from every other teaching. That's the thing that I'm anxious to emphasize
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:49.660]   tonight in terms of this great statement of the great Apostle. The gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.780]   is in a class on its own, but there's nothing else like it. Now, I don't want to say a
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.960]   word against the teachings of men or against the various things that are being said in
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.380]   the modern world this evening. That's not my case at all. I'm not even here to say
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.780]   that they're wrong. What I'm here to say is that the gospel is entirely different,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:17.620]   and that it's different because of this characteristic, its glory, its wonder, its
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.140]   amazing character. Now, let me illustrate very briefly, just in passing, in order to
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.500]   make this point clear to you and establish it in your minds, let me illustrate it by
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:37.220]   what is happening in this country at the present time. Next Thursday, the general election,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.660]   and in connection with that, of course, we listen to speeches. We are being addressed
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:48.300]   by different people belonging to various parties. Now, the point I'm establishing is this,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.220]   that all that's all right, but, you see, it doesn't belong to the same category,
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.740]   it doesn't belong to the same realm as what you and I are doing here tonight. Now, I'm
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.780]   not saying that that's wrong. It's got to be done. We are taught in the New Testament
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:10.820]   itself that the powers that be are ordained of God, that it is God who has ordained that
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.780]   there should be magistrates, and government, and law, and order. That's why we all ought
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:21.260]   to be interested in these things, and it's right that we should be. All I'm trying
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.340]   to show you is this, that when you come to the realm of this gospel, you come to a realm
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:35.540]   of something which is entirely and altogether different, that everything about it is different,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.820]   that while that is all right as far as it goes, politics is always partial, it is always
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:52.260]   incomplete, it is always lacking in something that is vital and fundamentally essential.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:58.020]   And therefore it's a good way for us to approach this whole matter this evening, that
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:05.220]   we should be adequately housed, and have adequate wages, and that everything should be done
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.880]   to avoid war. That's all right, it's common sense, and we should be concerned about these
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:19.180]   things. But I say again that all of those things are only relative. They're only relative.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:26.540]   And here we come to the realm of that which is profound, and fundamental, and eternal.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.260]   But the great difference, I say, and this is what I'm concerned about this evening,
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:38.180]   is that while all of that is all right, there's no glory about it, but the main and chief
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:45.260]   characteristic of this is that it is glorious. Now, listen to the way the apostle keeps on
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.820]   putting it. He goes on saying the same thing in different ways, having said that it is
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.380]   the glorious gospel of the blessed God. He says again, look here, this is a faithful
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:01.540]   saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:10.900]   of whom I am chief. This is a faithful saying. It's a reliable saying. You can take this,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.300]   not on the authority of men, not on the authority of parties, but on the authority of the blessed,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.500]   glorious God. This is worthy of all acceptation. There is no question or query about this.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.260]   There need be no doubt about this. This is an absolute something. That's how he puts
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:33.900]   it. Now, the question which we have to ask, therefore, is this. Why is this true of the
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.820]   gospel? And why are you and I tonight doing something that is in a category and a class
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:47.780]   entirely on its own, something altogether more vital and urgent and important than listening
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:53.920]   to all the speeches of men at their best and at their very highest? Why? What's the reason?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.660]   Well, let the apostle answer the question. The first answer he gives is this, that this
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:07.660]   is altogether different and has this character of glory and wonder and amazement, because
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:16.300]   it is something that starts with God and not with men. Now here, you see, at once is this
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:28.500]   vital difference. All other teachings start with men. Men and his needs, men and his desires,
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:36.860]   men and his prospects, men and his problems. All those start with men. All the politicians
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.620]   are addressing you directly. They start with you. They're all presenting themselves to
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:47.780]   you as people who can do better for you than the others can. You are the important person.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:54.020]   They're seeking your suffrage, your patronage, as it were, and so they're all vying with
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.060]   one another in telling you, "This is what I'll give you. This is what my party will
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.100]   give you. This is what my party will do for you." You see, everything starts with men
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.020]   and it's addressed to men, and men's at the centre, and men's needs and desires
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.300]   and problems constitute the first great matter for consideration. They start with men and
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.580]   they end with men. They may bring in the country, but primarily they're concerned about the
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.780]   individual. Men is the centre. Men is the important factor. And not only that, everything
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:34.460]   is done in human terms. We are addressed by men, as men, and in terms of something which
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:41.100]   lies within that circle, which includes both speaker and hearer.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:47.900]   Now here, I say, is the first big thing that we have to realise. When we come to a place
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.860]   like this, in the name of Christ, with an open Bible, we're immediately doing something
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:59.460]   different. The whole situation is different. Why? Well, because here, we don't start
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:08.780]   and end with men. We start with God. What is the Gospel? Well, you know, the first thing
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:16.220]   to say about the Gospel is not that it's good news for men. It is good news about God.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:25.120]   It is primarily an assertion concerning God. And here, you see, is the point that is made
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.900]   in the Bible from beginning to end. Where every other teaching goes wrong is that it
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:37.620]   starts with men instead of starting with God. But the Bible never makes that mistake. Here
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.860]   is a great big book, you see, a book which tells us how to live and so on, and is a great
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:49.020]   message for us. How does it begin? Does it say, "Well, now, the situation of men at
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:54.060]   this moment is this, that he's passed through two world wars, and that he's in trouble,
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.420]   and he's ill at ease, and he wants this and that?" That's the situation of men. The
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.460]   Bible doesn't start like that. The Bible says, "In the beginning, God." That's
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:11.140]   where the Bible starts. Nothing else starts like that. Everything else starts with men.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.340]   And men's reason and understanding, men's problems and difficulties and needs and desires.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:22.060]   This at once pulls us up. We're in another atmosphere as the apostle says, "God."
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:28.700]   Now, that's how the Bible starts. I could go on giving you many, many examples and illustrations
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:34.140]   of the same thing. Let me just give you one. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews writes
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.460]   his great epistle, and this is how he starts, "God, who at sundry times and in divers
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.660]   manners spake in times past to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.860]   unto us." God. It always starts with God. You see, this is the message of the gospel
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:58.060]   in John 3, 16. "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.340]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." The apostle Paul goes
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.940]   to Corinth, and he says, "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:16.340]   of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God." It's always the
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.540]   same. You read the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and you'll find that they were
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:27.740]   preaching about God. Do you remember the case of the apostle Paul preaching in a place called
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:35.860]   Lystra? He says the same thing, "Sirs, why do we these things? We also are men of like
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.740]   passions with you." They thought that Paul and his companion Barnabas were gods. "We
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.520]   also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that you should turn from
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.980]   these vanities," the idols that they were worshipping, "unto the living God, which
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.420]   made heaven and earth and the sea, and all things that are therein, who in times past
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.180]   suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.140]   witness, in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:12.140]   our hearts with food and gladness." That's how he preached. This is Christian preaching.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:21.140]   It starts, I say, always with God. Why? Well, the apostle tells us, really, why in this
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:26.300]   one verse, but then he elaborates it later. He says, "According to the gospel of the
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:34.500]   glory of the blessed God." You remember how later on, you see, having made this point,
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:41.340]   he bursts out again. He can't contain himself. "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:52.380]   the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen." Why do we start with God?
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:20:02.620]   Why must this always start with God? Well, the answers are these. Because God is God.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.940]   We come together like this, what for? Well, not to listen to my ideas or to my speaking.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.900]   I'm only a man amongst men, a fallible man, a sinful man, a failure in life like everybody
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.740]   else. I wouldn't have the temerity, I wouldn't have the arrogance and the impudence to ask
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.980]   you to sit and listen to what I think about this, that, or the other. It's all right,
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.020]   I can do it politically if you like, I could do that as well as these other politicians,
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   perhaps better than many of them these days, who don't seem to be able to speak, even
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:38.180]   if they have to read their speeches. They can't even speak any longer. But my dear
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:46.500]   friends, I'm not here in that kind of way or capacity at all. I'm here to talk about
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:56.100]   this blessed, glorious God, the King eternal, immortal, invisible. I'm not here even to
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:02.340]   talk about you. Primarily, I do talk about you, I shall talk about you, but I don't
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:07.060]   start with you. I'm privileged to tell you something much more wonderful than anything
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:13.020]   about you or about myself or about the whole world or about the whole of human history.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:22.420]   God, immortal, invisible, eternal, the only wise, the only true God, glory, characterized
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:36.260]   by glory and by blessedness. God he is. Jehovah, I am that I am. This everlasting and eternal
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:44.060]   God. Now, this is the supreme fact in the whole cosmos at this moment. Don't misunderstand
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.020]   me. I'm not here, and I don't want to give the impression that I'm concerned in any
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:55.100]   way to despise politics. I've already reminded you that the scriptures commend us to be concerned
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.580]   about these things. They're essential, and they're essential as I'm going to show you
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:07.660]   because men's a sinner. But I say that that isn't the theme of the gospel, and to reduce
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.300]   the gospel to something like that is a travesty of it. There's no glory because this is characterized
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:20.900]   by this glory because it is about God. And the business of the gospel is to tell us about
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:33.740]   God. God in three persons, blessed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, dwelling eternally
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:43.980]   from eternity to eternity, the great and the glorious God. Yes, and the God who made us,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.540]   the God who's created everything. You see, that is where men is so foolish in starting
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.620]   with himself. Why doesn't he ask the obvious question? Here I am in the world, but where's
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.180]   the world come from? What is the world? What's its origin? What's the origin of men? And
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:08.060]   the answer is, that God has made us and that we are ourselves. He is this eternal, immortal,
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:15.060]   invisible, only wise God. God the creator. God who commended the light to shine out of
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.860]   darkness. The God who said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The God who has
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.340]   formed and fashioned everything, and controls and sustains everything. This is what the
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:31.500]   gospel is about. So you see, we're not going to spend our evening in saying, "Now then,
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.580]   let's see that we put in a party that will prohibit the use of this or that, or will
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.820]   be dependent or not dependent upon America." That's not the business here. All right, you
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.620]   can argue about that if you like. It has its place. It has its legitimate interest for
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.980]   men and women, but I say that's not this business. So I'm not here to tell you who to vote for
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.620]   on Thursday. I'm here to tell you that God is over all. The Lord reigneth, let the people
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:06.980]   tremble. Because he is the creator. Because the world is his. Because he sustains everything.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:14.140]   Because he controls everything. And still more urgently vital for us. Because he is
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:25.300]   the judge of the whole earth, and of all the world. God sits upon the throne of the universe.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.780]   And the whole universe is responsible to him. And man is responsible to him. That's why
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:37.180]   we start with God. We must have a point of reference, as it were. We don't just start
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.380]   with ourselves and our needs and our problems and our difficulties, and our man-made solutions.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.500]   We've got to look right outside ourselves, and we start with this blessed, this glorious
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:55.260]   God, who, whatever may be happening to us, is worthy to be praised, deserves our adoration
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.180]   and our worship, and the whole of our being. The whole world should be on its knees before
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:08.260]   him, glorying in him. Now that's the message of the gospel. In other words, I'll put it
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:22.500]   like this. Man's supreme need is to know God. So the Bible starts with God. And by doing
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:28.260]   this, as I'm saying, it puts itself into a category that is entirely apart from all others,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.820]   it's entirely separate from. There's nothing else that does this. You see, the whole of
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.180]   civilization is turning around man, man's in the center, man's interest. I don't care
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.780]   what department. It may be an interest in music or in art or literature, anything you
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:48.580]   like. It's always man. But here is something that makes us look up and lift up our eyes
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:56.900]   and just consider this glorious person, the king, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:05.140]   wise God, to whom be honor and glory forever and ever. Now, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:12.420]   himself said this same thing. He put it like this. He says, "This is life eternal, that
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:19.100]   they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." The world's
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:27.220]   supreme need this evening is to know God, and therefore the gospel is primarily a message
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:36.940]   about God. Is this clear to all of us? There is a tendency sometimes, you know, even for
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:44.220]   the church herself to misrepresent this gospel by putting it into line with the cults. The
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.380]   cults, of course, always start with us. Are you unhappy? Come along, says the cult, I'll
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.500]   put you right. Are you ill? Are you worried? Are you fearful? Come along, we'll put you
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.940]   right. The cults always are offering you some ready-made remedies. Quite simple this. It's
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.860]   all here. Just do this and the rest will follow. You'll be quite happy. Now, that's typical
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.740]   of the cults, but that's not the gospel. My dear friend, the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.580]   not some sort of quack remedy even to make you happy or to do anything in particular
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:20.220]   for you. The business of the gospel is to bring you to God. No man hath seen God at
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:27.780]   any time. The only begotten who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.300]   The whole meaning and object and purpose of the incarnation of the Son of God and all
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:37.620]   he did was to bring us to God. Let me make it clear, not even to make you happy in the
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.500]   first instance. If you are just out for happiness or a bit of comfort or some particular thing
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.540]   that you stand in need of and come to the gospel for that, you're making a big mistake.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:58.780]   The gospel brings you face-to-face with God, the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:07.620]   only wise God. The gospel wants us to come to this place where, like Job of old, who
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:12.300]   had been talking a lot because he was suffering, you remember, with that horrible skin disease
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.060]   and made worse by the false friends who were trying to administer comfort to him, those
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.500]   Job's comforters. Job felt he'd got a grievance and he was saying many things about God. But
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.940]   then God suddenly revealed himself to him and spoke to him. Do you remember what poor
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.940]   old Job did? He did the thing we all do when we come face-to-face with God. We forget all
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.860]   our illnesses and problems and troubles and needs and desires and we just stop and put
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:46.900]   our hands upon our mouths and look up into his face, speechless, with amazement and astonishing,
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:54.140]   and we say, "I had heard of thee with a hearing of the ear, but now." And you put your hand
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.780]   upon your mouth. You see, my dear friends, this is the message the world needs tonight.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:05.500]   In all its busyness and all its excitement and all its arguments and wranglings and disputations,
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.220]   whether they be philosophical or religious or political, it doesn't matter at all. These
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:18.180]   things, all right up to a point, but what we all need is to know God, the gospel of
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.780]   the glory of the blessed God. Very well, there's the first reason, but let me hurry on to the
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:30.620]   second reason. The second reason the apostle gives us for starting with this is this, that
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:40.220]   all men's troubles ultimately arise from his failure to start with God. The gospel is different,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.540]   I say, because it starts with God, and it starts with God because men's troubles, all
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:55.580]   of them, arise eventually from his failure to start with God. As I say, man always starts
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:02.340]   with himself, and that is exactly where he goes wrong.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.740]   Now, I can summarize the message of the whole Bible for you very simply like this. This
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:14.380]   is its message, that everything that is true of mankind this evening, all our troubles,
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:23.100]   all our heartaches, all our pains, our problems, our illnesses, our diseases, everything, is
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:31.100]   due to the fact that mankind has turned away from God, that it doesn't start with God,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.900]   but it starts with itself, and puts itself in the supreme position. Now, you remember,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.860]   we are told how that began. The account is given in the third chapter of the book of
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.140]   Genesis. The temptation, the tempter came to the devil and said, "Hath God said? Has
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.380]   God said that you've got to be subservient to him? Don't listen to him. God knows very
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:56.100]   well that the moment you do what I tell you, you'll be as gods yourselves. Don't remain
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.780]   subservient. Don't remain as slaves. Listen to me," says the devil. "You'll become gods."
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:09.980]   Men listened. He ceased to glory God, and to glorify God. He put himself up. He started
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:16.260]   with himself. He says, "I'm to be the center." And from that act, that first act of disobedience
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:23.620]   and rebellion, all men's troubles have eventuated. That's the key to it all. Now, there it is
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:31.020]   stated in the Old Testament. Let me give you a statement of it in the New Testament. Listen
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.060]   to the apostle Paul putting it in the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans. I begin
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.780]   at verse 18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:47.060]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.100]   manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:57.500]   the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.980]   even his eternal power and Godhead." Now, says the apostle, the world is without excuse,
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.900]   because if mankind really only examined nature and creation as it is, it would have to believe
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:12.500]   in God. God left the evidence there, so that they are without excuse. Then listen, here
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:22.260]   it is, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful,
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.560]   but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:34.700]   themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.780]   God into an image made like to corruptible men, and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:49.540]   creeping things. Wherefore, because of that, God also gave them up to uncleanness, through
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:55.180]   the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who changed
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:00.400]   the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped himself the creature, more than the Creator
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.620]   who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause, God gave them up to vile affections." I
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.940]   don't apologize for reading this. People say, "Your gospel is so remote. Politics
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.740]   is at any rate practical, and deals with the problems of life." Very well, I want to
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:20.220]   deal with the problems of life. Listen, "For this cause, God gave them up to vile affections.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.620]   For even their women, they changed the natural use into that which is against nature. And
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.380]   likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:35.500]   toward another. Men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   that recompense of their error which was meet." That's practical politics for you. That's
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.660]   the problem of this country. The great Roman Empire went down. The decline and fall of
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.140]   the great Roman Empire. Why did she go down? Was it a military reason? It wasn't. It was
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:59.140]   a moral reason. This sort of thing went on, and down she went, is Britain following. "Even
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:05.380]   as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:12.020]   mind to do those things which are not convenient. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:18.340]   wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:24.900]   whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:31.620]   disobedient to parents." Isn't it an up-to-date gospel, this? "Disobedient to parents, without
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:36.540]   understanding, covenant-breakers, spitting on their marriage contracts and vows, tearing
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:43.540]   up everything that's sacred, without natural affection. Implacable, unmerciful, who, knowing
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.300]   the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.900]   do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." They write about it in the papers,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:59.900]   they bring it into their plays on your television, they're glorying in it and gloating in it.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:05.100]   Not only do it, but have pleasure in them that do them. Now, my friends, all that you
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:11.980]   see is due to the fact that man, when he knew God, glorified him not as God, neither was
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:18.980]   thankful. It is because mankind hasn't started with God and glorified him that it's in its
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:24.060]   present trouble and predicament. Now, you see, the apostle says exactly the same thing
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:28.700]   here to Timothy. He says, "These fellows are arguing about the law." And they say, "Oh,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   you must understand the law. This is the thing that matters. Paul was always preaching Jesus
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.580]   Christ and him crucified. That was sort of pie in the sky, but not the practical matters
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.700]   and you only get that in the law." "Listen," says Paul, "we know that the law is good if
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:47.500]   a man use it lawfully. Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, well,
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.380]   who is it made for? Lawless, disobedient, ungodly, sinners, unholy, profane, murderers
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.860]   of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers, whoremongers, them that defile themselves
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:04.520]   with mankind, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and any other thing that is contrary
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.020]   to its own doctrine. Tell me, why do you need politics? Why do you need a government at
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.780]   all? Why are governments necessary? Why do you have to have a legal system? Why do you
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.020]   have to have magistrates? Why do you need a police? My friends, these are the fundamental
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.380]   questions. Let the politicians argue as to the best way. I'm here to ask a profounder
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:31.380]   question. Why do you need politics at all? Why do you need law? Why do you need authority
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:39.820]   behind law? Why is it necessary? And there's only one answer to this. It is because man
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:46.840]   doesn't start with God, but always starts with himself. It is because men doesn't glorify
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:53.200]   God, because he knows nothing about the glory of this blessed God, this king, immortal,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.400]   invisible, the only wise God. That's where all our troubles have come from. And that's
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.560]   the matter with which the gospel deals. And that is why it starts with God, and not with
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.200]   men. Now, you see, it works like this. The moment man starts with himself instead of
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   God, and the moment man ceases to glorify God, certain things follow immediately and
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   of necessity. Because modern man doesn't believe in God, he's got a false view of himself.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.800]   That's man's trouble at the moment. He's got a wrong view of himself. It's a very inflated
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   one. Man thinks he's very big and very important. How he can think so amazes me. How small he
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:47.240]   is and how insignificant. He bursts about our astrophysics, our atomic science. He talks
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   about his telescopes and all that's happening in outer space and the galaxies and all these
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.480]   things. And yet, having looked into that immensity, he's still fool enough to think that he's
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   somebody and he's big. Modern man's a pervert. He can't think straightly. If he could, he'd
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:12.040]   say with the psalmist, "When I behold the sun and the moon and the stars which thou hast
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:18.520]   ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of him? How small he seems and how insignificant."
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   But you see, that's because he believed in God who was behind all. But modern man at
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.320]   all times, when he doesn't start with God and when he doesn't glorify God, he always
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.680]   gets this wrong view of himself. What is man's view of himself? Well, I'll tell you, that's
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.520]   why he's interested in politics. He wants more money. That's his view of man, you see,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.320]   that man is a kind of animal who's in this world to enjoy himself. So he must have money
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.680]   because he must eat and the more he eats and the best food and all the latest recipes and
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:56.560]   all the concoctions, food and drink and sex and enjoyment and pleasure. This is man. This
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.360]   is what man's made for and he wants more of it. So you see, you get this so-called spiral
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.440]   that the politicians are talking to us about. You see, because a man and his wife spend
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.640]   between the more than two pounds a week on cigarettes, the wages have got to go up and
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.920]   then the cigarettes go up and then the wages and the cigarettes and up and up you go in
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:21.240]   the spiral. And all the politicians are trying to bribe us somehow or another. Why don't
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.160]   they face the fundamental question? Is it essential that this money should be spent
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.920]   on tobacco or drink or anything else, food or anything else that you may like to talk
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.660]   about or your motor car or your television or your washing machine? You see, the fundamental
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.000]   cause of all our troubles is man's sin. It's his false view of himself. He thinks he's
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.740]   just here to enjoy himself and enjoyment means eating, drinking, sex. And there's very little
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:53.360]   beyond that. That's his view of himself. Because he doesn't start with God, he's got a completely
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.740]   wrong view of himself. And then another thing which the Bible brings out as a great point
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:04.000]   always in this connection is this, that man, because he doesn't believe in God, has no
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:12.960]   basis for his moral behavior. He's got no standard to decide how he's going to live.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.440]   As a man thinks, so he is, so he does. If my view of a man is that he's just an animal
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.920]   whose cortex has developed a little bit more than in most animals, but still essentially
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.240]   an animal, well then of course if that's my view of myself I will act accordingly. And
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.880]   if my view of man is that he hasn't got a soul and that there isn't a God and that when
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.200]   a man dies that's the end of him, well then I say I'm an animal and I'm going to live
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.680]   as an animal. I get my pattern in the farmyard. If I want a thing, I take it. I obey my instinct,
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.840]   my lust, my desire. And that's what men and women are doing. They get married, they break
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.800]   it, they're out of it in a week or so, so many of them. And then they're married again
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.720]   and out of it. And the whole scandal of life results and all the suffering and the misery
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.280]   of innocent children and others. It's all because men, having turned his back upon God
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:09.160]   and God's glory, he's got no reference for his moral behavior. And so you see that is
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:13.480]   what's stated there in that extraordinary paragraph I read to you just now from the
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:19.560]   first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and it is the same thing here. Man, when he
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:26.400]   starts with himself and when he doesn't glorify God and puts himself up as the ultimate standard
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:34.920]   of everything, always ends, not only in sin, but in complete lawlessness, not only in immorality,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:41.120]   but in amorality, non-morality, with all the perversions and all that is unnatural and
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.600]   foul. It's invariable. He hasn't got a right view of himself. He's got no standard for
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.240]   moral behavior. And so he behaves as he is behaving in the modern world. It's the sole
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:03.520]   explanation. Now, that's the great case of the Bible. I'm interested to notice that certain
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:10.840]   unbelieving humanists, people who don't believe in God and who are active critics and opponents
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.880]   of Christian doctrine, they're beginning to say something very much like the Bible. Let
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   me give you a quotation from a famous lady, humanist, sociologist, who is very concerned
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:28.480]   about these things. I'm quoting from Lady Wotton. This is what she says, that the whole
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:36.960]   trouble today is the total failure of society to provide any alternative basis for morality.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.400]   She says that's our trouble. She says we no longer believe, of course, in the Christian
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:46.880]   doctrines. She says our trouble is we have completely failed to provide any alternative
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.760]   basis for morality. We don't believe in the gospel any longer as the basis, but we've
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.600]   completely failed to provide another. She goes on to say this, so long as this vacuum
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:06.200]   is not filled, so long must we continue to get the delinquency we deserve. She says we
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.400]   can't believe the gospel any longer, but she says we are not providing these young people
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.040]   with any other standard, and we are getting the delinquency, juvenile delinquency and
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.080]   other forms of delinquency that we deserve. She says we are leaving a gap, we are a vacuum.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.020]   We've taken out the only moral authority recognized throughout the centuries, and we've completely
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:31.600]   failed to find another. And she'll go on failing. There is no other. That's the case of the
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.400]   Bible. Let me read you another statement. Here is a man who has written many books on
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   the whole problem of men. He says more serious than the distortions of argument just indicated
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:49.480]   in his article is the fact that the most fundamental argument of all is precisely the consideration
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:56.560]   that has been most disregarded, has entered least into public discussion. Then he goes
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:05.640]   on. The neglected proposition is this. Unless we reshape our culture, particularly our very
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:13.600]   traditional education, sufficiently to grapple with the irrational forces in human nature
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:22.640]   which now so largely dominate the public mind, and thus dictate policy, our relatively free
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:30.920]   Western society cannot survive. It will either be extinguished physically, by which he means
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:37.760]   the letting off of the hydrogen bomb, or something like that, or give place to totalitarian forms
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:46.120]   enabling absolute dictatorships to deal with the indisciplines by sheer coercion. And that
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:53.740]   is absolutely true. What he says is this. If we don't do something about this irrationality,
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:58.240]   this lack of reason in men and in his behavior, which is dominating society, he says, the
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.320]   whole of Western society, and it is, you know, for men to live like an animal is completely
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:09.680]   irrational. For men to deny the soul is to be irrational. He says if we don't do something
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.840]   about it, either the world is going to blow itself up by one of these bombs, or else,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.960]   he says, we are going to get some form of a dictatorship that is going to compel us.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.280]   Now Hitler did that in Germany, and that is how he fooled many Christians in Germany.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.680]   Hitler, you see, in his desire to restore the prestige and the power of Germany, he
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.400]   said, my first task is to clean up Germany morally, and he did so. He really did so.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.240]   He prohibited nightclubs and things like that. He said a nation that is living immorally
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.640]   like this can never be a great and a strong military nation. He cleaned up the moral situation
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:50.680]   by his dictatorship. He prohibited it. But he produced something that was even worse,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:56.000]   didn't he? That's the very danger against which these men are warning us. They are admitting,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.280]   you see, now that once you take out the gospel, you've got no moral standard, you've got no
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.680]   moral sanction. People can say, why should I? My opinion is as good as yours. If I like
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.480]   this, why shouldn't I do this? That's the argument today. Do as you like, do as you
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.240]   please. It leads to chaos. And he says if it goes on, it's going to be one of two ends.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.760]   So you see, at last, these humanists are beginning to say what the gospel has been saying from
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:24.200]   the beginning, that man, when he doesn't start with God but puts himself as the center and
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.560]   the authority and the source of everything, always degenerates morally, becomes foul,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.920]   vicious, vile, irrational, and threatens to bring disaster upon himself.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:42.440]   But lastly, and let me close with a hopeful note, why is Paul so proud of this gospel
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:48.040]   that's been delivered to him to preach? Well, he says it's about God. It's the only thing
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:54.480]   that really exposes men's ultimate need. And finally he says it's a glorious gospel because
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:03.460]   it works. It's the only thing that does work. Now, this is a sure statement of fact. Nothing
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:12.120]   else works. You read the great history of civilizations, and you will find that they
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.840]   have to admit that they don't work. The world wouldn't be in its present predicament if
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:26.120]   men could do it, if civilization could do it. It can't do it. This country is the mother
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:34.840]   of parliaments, the mother of democracy, if you like, has produced so many excellent things.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.760]   But has she solved the problem of life and living? Look at the answer, round and about
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.000]   you. No, no, men can't do it. He doesn't know the answer. The problem is too profound for
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.760]   him. Civilization has failed. Civilization is failing. Civilization will always fail.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.160]   And that is why to put your final faith and hope in men or change of government or anything
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:08.760]   else is just to be ignorant, leave alone to be childish. Is there no hope, you say? Listen,
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:18.680]   my dear friend. It is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:25.040]   came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief. The answer is the gospel of
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:33.800]   the glory of the blessed God or the glorious gospel of the blessed God. Here's the answer.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.160]   This is not some little argument about politics or some disputation about law and morality
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   and ethics and these various other things. No, no, don't do that, says Paul, vain, jangling,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.640]   useless, doesn't deal with the problem. Come, let us look at the glorious gospel of the
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:55.280]   blessed God. What is this? Well, it isn't just good advice. It isn't mere exhortation.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.720]   There's no point in doing that. Men can't resolve his problems. He can't reform himself.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.940]   He can't give himself a new nature. Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:13.920]   spots? Of course he can't. Man has tried, man has failed. Civilization's a failure.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:23.160]   And here is the only answer. The blessed God is concerned. This glorious being is concerned.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.920]   This king, eternal, immortal, invisible, he who made the universe is concerned about it
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.280]   and he's done something about it. And the gospel is the record and the account of what
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.160]   he has done and what he offers to anybody who is prepared to listen to it. It is here,
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:44.760]   you see, all the great characteristics of God revealed, his glorious attributes. First
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:55.460]   is wisdom. What is this message? Well, it is God's way of saving men. It's God's wisdom.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:01.800]   It isn't human theorizing. It isn't human ideas. It's God, God's everlasting and eternal
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   wisdom. He has devised a plan whereby men can be delivered, whereby men can be saved,
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.600]   whereby men can be set free. That's what made this man thrilled about it. He says it's a
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:16.120]   faithful saying. Take it from me, he says, it's worthy of all acceptation that Christ
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.680]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief. What's a sinner is
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.200]   a failure. He's a person who can't put himself right. He's one who's guilty before God. He's
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.800]   a man who's weak. He's a man who's afraid to die. He's a man who's not ready to face
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.520]   the judgment in eternity. All his wisdom is valueless, but God's wisdom has come in and
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:41.960]   here it is, says Paul, it saved me. What is this wisdom? Well, this is the wisdom that
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:49.440]   tells us that our great need, I say again, is God, the knowledge of God. We need to know
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.640]   him and to be blessed of him, but we can never know that until we've been forgiven, we've
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.080]   sinned against him. How can I, who've rebelled against God and spat in his face, how can
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.280]   I go and ask God for a blessing? If you've got any sense, you'll see it's impossible.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.800]   How can you approach God? What right have you? What claim? Your record is altogether
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   against you and he's a just and a holy and a righteous God. What can you do? You need
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:22.040]   forgiveness and you can do nothing about it. You say, I'll try and live a better life in
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.800]   the future, but you'll fail. You can't do it in your own strength. In any case, what
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:31.720]   about the record of the past? You can't erase it. I can spot it, but you can't. It's there.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   You can't get rid of it. The spot's on your soul. Man needs forgiveness. He needs to be
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:45.800]   reconciled to God. He needs renewal. He needs life. He needs power. He needs a new vigor.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:52.320]   He needs a new everything. Thank God. It's available. This is the wisdom of God. God
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.760]   has provided a way and there was only one way, you know, and that was that his own blessed
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.880]   eternal only begotten Son should come down on earth and be born as a babe, take human
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:08.160]   nature unto himself, be made flesh, become a man and live in this world as a man, become
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:17.000]   a new representative for men and satisfy the demands of God and he came. That's God's wisdom.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.840]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. This is the wisdom of God. It is
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:29.560]   in this blessed person, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That's God's wisdom and thank
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.720]   God there is power in it. It works. That's why the apostle says to those Romans, I am
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:40.320]   not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and to salvation to everyone
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:45.040]   that believeth. Is it? I need forgiveness. I can do nothing about it. My sins must be
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:51.520]   punished. How can I be forgiven? Here is one who says, "Here am I." And God puts my sins
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.680]   upon him. I'll punish them in him, he says. Can he stand it? Can he take it? Yes, he can.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.280]   He can take the sins of his people and God has punished them in him. He dies. Yes, but
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:07.360]   he rises again. He's got the power. He's God as well as man. He deals with the problem
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:14.760]   of my sin, my guilt, and he reconciles me to God. He made full satisfaction. He's also
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   conquered my every enemy. He conquered the devil. He fulfilled the law. He conquered
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:30.360]   death, the last enemy, and the grave. He's conquered everything that is set against us.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:35.720]   He's got the power to do it, the power of the resurrection. He burst asunder the bands
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:45.360]   of death. He arose triumphant over the grave. His power is endless, illimitable. He's risen.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:52.840]   And he joins me to himself. He enters into me and he strengthens me, gives me new life,
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.040]   new power, a new love, a new objective, a new everything. He leads me by the hand. He'll
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.760]   hold me until the end and finally present me faultless before the presence of God's
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:09.200]   glory with exceeding joy. The wisdom of God and the power of God. This is the glory of
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.240]   this blessed God shown in the gospel. That's why the apostle describes it like this. And
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:28.120]   finally, the love of God. "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:36.320]   whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." God so loved
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.440]   the world, the world that had sinned against him, the world that had rebelled against him,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.800]   the world that had turned its back on him, the world that had put itself up in his place.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:51.120]   Love, this is God's love. That for a world like that that deserves nothing but hell and
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:59.880]   damnation and endless suffering, God for that world sent his only Son into it. And the Son
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:09.920]   came willingly into it. He laid aside the signs of his eternal glory. He humbled himself
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.580]   and came in the likeness of men. He endured the contradiction of sinners against himself
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.320]   in this evil world. That's the love of God. And then, oh, most wonderful of all, look
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.400]   at that hill called Calvary. Look at that cross there in the middle, the person between
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:29.120]   the two thieves. Who is he? He's Son of God. Why is he doing, what's he doing there? What's
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:37.040]   happening to him? God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. The God you've offended
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:44.520]   and against whom you've sinned. He's putting your sin and your guilt onto his own beloved
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:51.240]   blessed Son. And he's punishing him for you. And he's bearing the punishment willingly
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:57.960]   that you and I might be forgiven and might be redeemed. Oh, yes, there you see the love
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:04.720]   of God. The second blessed person, the Christ, the Son of God, leaving the eternal glory,
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:12.200]   coming to this world, obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross, death and burial,
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.840]   all for you and for me, and then the rising and the returning and the sending of the blessed
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.920]   Spirit upon us. They're all involved. The three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:32.720]   and the love that each displays, all for you and for me. Now, my friend, are you surprised
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:39.440]   that the great apostle protests against those silly, foolish teachers who were talking about
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:45.120]   endless genealogies and about angels and about the minutiae of the details of the law, the
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:52.200]   clever people? Are you surprised that he turns upon them with a heavenly, divine kind of
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:58.080]   scorn and says, "That's not the gospel, it's too small, it's too petty, it's too insignificant."
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:09.360]   Listen, he says, to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God. Here it is, that Christ
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:17.440]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners. The glorious God entering in, coming into
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:25.680]   time, suffering, death, burial, and grave, and all that you and I might be saved. I,
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:35.240]   the chief of sinners, end whosoever, recognizing his sin and his need, turns unto him in utter
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:41.760]   helplessness and believes on him. Aren't you ready to agree with me now? There's nothing
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:51.560]   in the universe like this, is there? Start with God and end with Jesus Christ and him
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:58:00.440]   crucified. And you will begin to join the apostle in raising up your hands and your
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:11.760]   heart and the whole of your being and saying now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible,
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:24.800]   the only wise God, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
