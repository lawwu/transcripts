[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   The following is a conversation with Eugenia Koida,
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.040]   co-founder of Replica, which is an app that allows you
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.260]   to make friends with an artificial intelligence system,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460]   a chatbot that learns to connect with you on an emotional,
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600]   you could even say a human level, by being a friend.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.920]   For those of you who know my interest in AI
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.780]   and views on life in general,
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.100]   know that Replica and Eugenia's line of work
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.060]   is near and dear to my heart.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.420]   The origin story of Replica is grounded
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.360]   in a personal tragedy of Eugenia losing her close friend,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.980]   Roman Mazurenki, who was killed crossing the street
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.240]   by a hit and run driver in late 2015.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   He was 34.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.400]   The app started as a way to grieve the loss of a friend
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.200]   by training a chatbot neural net on text messages
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.520]   between Eugenia and Roman.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.140]   The rest is a beautiful human story
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.760]   as we talk about with Eugenia.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.640]   When a friend mentioned Eugenia's work to me,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.880]   I knew I had to meet her and talk to her.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.680]   I felt before, during, and after that this meeting
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.960]   would be an important one in my life, and it was.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.760]   I think in ways that only time will truly show,
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760]   to me and others.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.580]   She's a kind and brilliant person.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.080]   It was an honor and a pleasure to talk to her.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.780]   Quick summary of the sponsors,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.220]   DoorDash, Dollar Shave Club, and Cash App.

[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.400]   As a side note, let me say that deep, meaningful connection
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   between human beings and artificial intelligence systems
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.780]   is a lifelong passion for me.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.840]   I'm not yet sure where that passion will take me,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.880]   but I decided some time ago that I will follow it boldly
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.240]   and without fear, to as far as I can take it.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840]   With a bit of hard work and a bit of luck,
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.780]   I hope I'll succeed in helping build AI systems
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.040]   that have some positive impact on the world
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   and on the lives of a few people out there.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.640]   But also, it is entirely possible that I am, in fact,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.480]   one of the chatbots that Eugenia
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.600]   and the Replica team have built.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.400]   And this podcast is simply a training process
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   for the neural net that's trying to learn
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.060]   to connect to human beings, one episode at a time.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.260]   In any case, I wouldn't know if I was or wasn't.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.240]   And if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.680]   I'll try to make these interesting,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.920]   but give you timestamps so you can skip.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.760]   But please do still check out the sponsors
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.400]   by clicking the links in the description

[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.300]   It really is the best way to support this podcast.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.100]   This show is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.740]   Try them out with a one-time offer for only five bucks
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.000]   and free shipping at dollarshave.com/lex.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.920]   The starter kit comes with a six blade razor,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.100]   refills, and all kinds of other stuff
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.820]   that makes shaving feel great.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.620]   I've been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over five years.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.820]   I actually signed up when I first heard about them
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.380]   on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.820]   And now, friends, we have come full circle.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.820]   It feels like I made it, now that I can do a read for them
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.200]   just like Joe did all those years ago,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   back when he also did ads for some less reputable companies,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.700]   let's say, that you know about if you're a true fan
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.380]   of the old school podcasting world.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.480]   Anyway, I just used the razor and the refills,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.580]   but they told me I should really try out the shave butter.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.620]   I did, I love it.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.660]   It's translucent somehow, which is a cool new experience.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.820]   Again, try the Ultimate Shave Starter set today
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.940]   for just five bucks plus free shipping

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.420]   This show is also sponsored by DoorDash.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.900]   Get $5 off and zero delivery fees
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.260]   on your first order of 15 bucks or more
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.340]   when you download the DoorDash app and enter code,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.780]   you guessed it, Lex.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.060]   Have so many memories of working late nights
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.600]   for a deadline with a team of engineers,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.940]   whether that's for my PhD at Google or MIT,
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.280]   and eventually taking a break to argue about
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.740]   which DoorDash restaurant to order from.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.380]   And when the food came, those moments of bonding,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.400]   of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.220]   from the programs to humans were special.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.020]   For a bit of time, I'm on my own now,
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.780]   so I missed that camaraderie,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.260]   but actually I still use DoorDash a lot.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.620]   There's a million options that fit
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.020]   into my crazy keto diet ways.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.500]   Also, it's a great way to support restaurants
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.060]   in these challenging times.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.220]   Once again, download the DoorDash app
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.820]   and enter code Lex to get five bucks off
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   and zero delivery fees on your first order of $15 or more.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.260]   Finally, this show is presented by Cash App,
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.580]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.740]   I can truly say that they're an amazing company,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.380]   one of the first sponsors, if not the first sponsor,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.540]   to truly believe in me.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.500]   And I think quite possibly the reason
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.740]   I'm still doing this podcast.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.180]   So I am forever grateful to Cash App.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.860]   So thank you.
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.940]   And as I said many times before,
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.420]   use code LexPodcast when you download the app
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.780]   from Google Play or the App Store.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.660]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.060]   buy Bitcoin, invest in the stock market
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.580]   with as little as $1.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.400]   I usually say other stuff here in the read,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.340]   but I wasted all that time up front
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.500]   saying how grateful I am to Cash App.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.020]   I'm going to try to go off the top of my head
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.040]   a little bit more for these reads
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.460]   because I'm actually very lucky to be able to choose
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.220]   the sponsors that we take on.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.060]   And that means I can really only take on the sponsors
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.340]   that I truly love.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.420]   And then I could just talk about why I love them.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.140]   So it's pretty simple.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.140]   Again, get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.540]   use code LexPodcast, get 10 bucks,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.380]   and Cash App will also donate 10 bucks to FIRST,
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.660]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.540]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.380]   And now here's my conversation with Eugenia Kuida.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.340]   Okay, before we talk about AI
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.260]   and the amazing work you're doing,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.780]   let me ask you ridiculously, we're both Russian,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.420]   so let me ask you a ridiculously romanticized
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.700]   Russian question.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.460]   Do you think human beings are alone,
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.000]   like fundamentally on a philosophical level?
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.260]   Like in our existence, when we like go through life,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.140]   do you think just the nature of our life is loneliness?
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.420]   - Yeah, so we have to read Dostoyevsky at school,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.620]   as you probably know.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.500]   - In Russian?
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.060]   - Yeah, I mean, it's part of the school program.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.060]   So I guess if you read that,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.440]   then you sort of have to believe that.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.580]   You're made to believe that you're fundamentally alone
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.980]   and that's how you live your life.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.580]   - How do you think about it?
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.740]   You have a lot of friends, but at the end of the day,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.140]   do you have like a longing for connection with other people?
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.260]   That's maybe another way of asking it.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.320]   Do you think that's ever fully satisfied?
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.180]   - I think we are fundamentally alone.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.220]   We're born alone, we die alone,
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.020]   but I view my whole life as trying to get away from that,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.980]   trying to not feel lonely.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.940]   And again, we're talking about subjective
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.020]   way of feeling alone.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.860]   It doesn't necessarily mean
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.180]   that you don't have any connections
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.940]   or you are actually isolated.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.500]   - You think it's a subjective thing,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.200]   but like, again, another absurd measurement-wise thing,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.100]   how much loneliness do you think there is in the world?
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.100]   So like, if you see loneliness as a condition,
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.360]   how much of it is there?
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.220]   What do you think?
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.180]   Like how, I guess how many,
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.820]   there's all kinds of studies and measures
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.780]   of how many people in the world feel alone.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.500]   There's all these like measures of how many people
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.820]   are self-report or just all these kinds
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.840]   of different measures, but in your own perspective,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.660]   how big of a problem do you think it is size-wise?
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.340]   - Well, I'm actually fascinated by the topic of loneliness.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.980]   I try to read about it as much as I can.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.420]   What really, and I think there's a paradox
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.840]   'cause loneliness is not a clinical disorder.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.980]   It's not something that you can get your insurance
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.980]   to pay for if you're struggling with that.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.020]   Yet it's actually proven and pretty,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.180]   tons of papers, tons of research around that.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.340]   It is proven that it's correlated
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.020]   with earlier life expectancy, shorter lifespan.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.100]   And it is in a way like right now,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.960]   what scientists would say that it's a little bit worse
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.300]   than being obese or not actually doing
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.020]   any physical activity in your life.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.860]   - In terms of the impact on your health.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.860]   - In terms of impact on your physiological health, yeah.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.500]   So it's basically puts you,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.340]   if you're constantly feeling lonely,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.300]   your body responds like it's basically
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.140]   all the time under stress.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.260]   So it's always in this alert state.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.100]   And so it's really bad for you
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.900]   because it actually like drops your immune system
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.860]   and your response to inflammation is quite different.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.080]   So all the cardiovascular diseases
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.800]   actually responds to viruses.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.980]   So it's much easier to catch a virus.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.120]   - That's sad now that we're living in a pandemic
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.920]   and it's probably making us a lot more alone
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.800]   and it's probably weakening the immune system,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.640]   making us more susceptible to the virus.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.080]   It's kind of sad.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   - Yeah, the statistics are pretty horrible around that.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.800]   So around 30% of all millennials report
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.440]   that they're feeling lonely constantly.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   - 30?
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.600]   - 30% and then it's much worse for Gen Z.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.560]   And then 20% of millennials say that they feel lonely
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.760]   and they also don't have any close friends.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.800]   And then I think 25 or so,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.680]   and then 20% would say they don't even have acquaintances.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.960]   - And that's the United States?
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.600]   - That's in the United States.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.880]   And I'm pretty sure that it's much worse everywhere else.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.340]   Like in the UK, I mean, it was widely tweeted
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.360]   and posted when they were talking about
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   a minister of loneliness that they wanted to appoint
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.280]   because four out of 10 people in UK feel lonely.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.120]   So I think we don't--
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.480]   - Minister of loneliness.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.920]   - I mean, I think that thing actually exists.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   So yeah, you will die sooner if you are lonely.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.840]   And again, this is only when we're only talking
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.040]   about your perception of loneliness or feeling lonely.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.120]   That is not objectively being fully socially isolated.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.440]   However, the combination of being fully socially isolated
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.400]   and not having many connections and also feeling lonely,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.720]   that's pretty much a deadly combination.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.360]   So it strikes me bizarre or strange
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.440]   that this is a wide known fact.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.680]   And then there's really no one working really on that
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.040]   because it's subclinical.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.880]   It's not clinical.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.480]   It's not something that you can,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.320]   we'll tell you a doctor and get a treatment or something.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   Yet it's killing us.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.640]   - Yeah, so there's a bunch of people trying to evaluate,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.440]   like try to measure the problem by looking at like
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.360]   how social media is affecting loneliness
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.200]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.840]   So it's like measurement.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.880]   Like if you look at the field of psychology,
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.680]   they're trying to measure the problem
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.760]   and not that many people actually, but some.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.800]   But you're basically saying how many people
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.920]   are trying to solve the problem.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.280]   Like how would you try to solve the problem of loneliness?
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.120]   Like if you just stick to humans,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.040]   I mean, or basically not just the humans,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.720]   but the technology that connects us humans,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   do you think there's a hope for that technology
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.080]   to do the connection?
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.480]   Like are you on social media much?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.280]   - Unfortunately.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.160]   - Do you find yourself like, again,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.640]   if you sort of introspect about how connected you feel
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.360]   to other human beings, how not alone you feel,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.440]   do you think social media makes it better or worse?
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.900]   Maybe for you personally or in general?
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.860]   - I think it's easier to look at some stats.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.900]   And I mean, Gen Z seems to be, Generation Z
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.140]   seems to be much lonelier than millennials
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.300]   in terms of how they report loneliness.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.020]   They're definitely the most connected
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.940]   generation in the world.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.500]   I mean, I still remember life without an iPhone,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.380]   without Facebook.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.500]   They don't know that that ever existed
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.340]   or at least don't know how it was.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.740]   So that tells me a little bit about the fact
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.740]   that that might be, you know, this hyperconnected world
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.540]   might actually make people feel lonelier.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.460]   I don't know exactly what the measurements are around that,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.540]   but I would say, you know, in my personal experience,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.220]   I think it does make you feel a lot lonelier.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.180]   Mostly, yeah, we're all super connected,
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.780]   but I think loneliness, the feeling of loneliness
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.540]   doesn't come from not having any social connections
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.380]   whatsoever.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.060]   Again, in terms of people that are in long-term
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.940]   relationships experience bouts of loneliness
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.740]   and continued loneliness.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.820]   And it's more the question about the true connection,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.760]   about actually being deeply seen, deeply understood.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.180]   And in a way, it's also about your relationship
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.020]   with yourself.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.380]   Like in order to not feel lonely,
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.660]   you actually need to have a better relationship
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.380]   and feel more connected to yourself.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.540]   Then this feeling actually starts to go away a little bit.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.700]   And then you open up yourself to actually meeting
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.520]   other people in a very special way,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.320]   not in just, you know, add a friend on Facebook kind of way.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.060]   - So just to briefly touch on it, I mean,
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.820]   do you think it's possible to form that kind of connection
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.060]   with AI systems?
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.140]   More down the line of some of your work,
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.180]   do you think that's engineering-wise a possibility
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.540]   to alleviate loneliness is not with another human,
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.980]   but with an AI system?
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.100]   - Well, I know that's a fact.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.100]   That's what we're doing.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.780]   And we see it and we measure that.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.940]   And we see how people start to feel less lonely
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.780]   talking to their virtual AI friend.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.180]   - So basically a chatbot at the basic level,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.620]   but could be more.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.220]   Like, do you have, I'm not even speaking sort of
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.580]   about specifics, but do you have a hope?
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.260]   Like if you look 50 years from now,
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.620]   do you have a hope that there's just like AIs
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.580]   that are like optimized for, let me first start,
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.740]   like right now, the way people perceive AI,
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.540]   which is recommender systems for Facebook and Twitter,
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.420]   social media, they see AI as basically destroying,
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.120]   first of all, the fabric of our civilization,
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.700]   but second of all, making us more lonely.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.420]   Do you see like a world where it's possible
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.500]   to just have AI systems floating about
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.700]   that like make our life less lonely?
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.420]   Make us happy?
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.180]   Like are putting good things into the world
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.500]   in terms of our individual lives?
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.100]   - Yeah, I totally believe in that.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.420]   That's why I'm also working on that.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.940]   I think we need to also make sure
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.180]   that what we're trying to optimize for,
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.900]   we're actually measuring.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.180]   And it is an orthometric that we're going after.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.580]   And all of our product and all of our business models
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.180]   are optimized for that.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.420]   Because you can talk, you know,
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.940]   a lot of products that talk about, you know,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.420]   making you feel less lonely
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.200]   or making you feel more connected,
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.480]   they're not really measuring that.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.460]   So they don't really know whether their users
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.060]   are actually feeling less lonely in the long run
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.160]   or feeling more connected in the long run.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.740]   So I think it's really important to put your--
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.580]   - To measure it.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.620]   - Yeah, to measure it.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.820]   - What's a good measurement of loneliness?
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.940]   - Well, so that's something that I'm really interested in.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.540]   How do you measure that people are feeling better
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.080]   or that they're feeling less lonely?
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.500]   With loneliness, there's a scale.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.540]   There's a UCLA 20 and UCLA 3 recently scale,
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.420]   which is basically a questionnaire that you fill out.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.220]   And you can see whether in the long run
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.540]   it's improving or not.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.380]   - And that, does it capture the momentary
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.020]   feeling of loneliness?
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.420]   Does it look in like the past month?
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.180]   Like, is it basically self-report?
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.740]   Does it try to sneak up on you?
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.380]   Try to trick you to answer honestly or something like that?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.340]   Well, what's, yeah, I'm not familiar with the question.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.780]   - It is just asking you a few questions,
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.460]   like how often did you feel like lonely
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.460]   or how often do you feel connected to other people
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.840]   in this last few couple of weeks?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.780]   It's similar to the self-report questionnaires
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.540]   for depression and anxiety, like PHQ-9 and GAT-7.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.840]   Of course, as any self-report questionnaires,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.660]   that's not necessarily very precise or very well measured.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.940]   But still, if you take a big enough population,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.540]   you get them through these questionnaires,
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.360]   you can see a positive dynamic.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.180]   - And so you basically,
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.180]   you put people through questionnaires to see,
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.380]   like, is this thing, is what we're creating
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.780]   making people happier?
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.540]   - Yeah, we measure, so we measure two outcomes.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.660]   One short-term, right after the conversation,
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.820]   we ask people whether this conversation
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.460]   made them feel better, worse, or same.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.100]   This metric right now is at 80%,
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.140]   so 80% of all our conversations make people feel better.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.660]   - But I should have done the questionnaire with you.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.460]   You feel a lot worse after we've done this conversation.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.300]   That's actually fascinating.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.220]   I should probably do that.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.820]   - But that's our-- - I should probably do that.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.020]   - You should totally start measuring.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.460]   - And aim for 80%.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.820]   - Aim to outperform your current state-of-the-art AI system
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.420]   in these human conversations.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.060]   So again, we'll get to your work with Replica,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.980]   but let me continue on the line of absurd questions.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.140]   So you talked about deep connection with other humans,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.780]   deep connection with AI, meaningful connection.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.900]   Let me ask about love.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.140]   People make fun of me 'cause I talk about love all the time,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.460]   but what do you think love is?
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.460]   Like maybe in the context of a meaningful connection
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.980]   with somebody else, do you draw a distinction
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.980]   between love, like friendship, and Facebook friends?
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.460]   Or is it a gradual-- - The answer is no.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.420]   (both laughing)
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.980]   It's all the same.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.020]   - No, like is it just a gradual thing,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.340]   or is there something fundamental about us humans
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.460]   that seek like a really deep connection
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.820]   with another human being, and what is that?
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.560]   What is love, Eugenia?
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.940]   I just enjoy asking you these questions--
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.540]   - I like that. - And seeing you struggle.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.340]   - I know, thanks.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.580]   Well, the way I see it, and specifically,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.820]   the way it relates to our work
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.540]   and the way it inspired our work on "Replica,"
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.460]   I think one of the biggest and the most precious gifts
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.220]   we can give to each other now in 2020 as humans
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.780]   is this gift of deep, empathetic understanding,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.300]   the feeling of being deeply seen.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.260]   - Like what does that mean, that you exist,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.020]   like somebody acknowledging that?
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.740]   - Somebody seeing you for who you actually are,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.140]   and that's extremely, extremely rare.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.120]   I think that combined with unconditional positive regard,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:02.160]   belief, and trust that you internally are
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.820]   always inclined for positive growth
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   and believing in you in this way,
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.860]   letting you be a separate person at the same time,
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.600]   and this deep, empathetic understanding,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.760]   for me, that's the combination
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.340]   that really creates something special,
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.340]   something that people, when they feel it once,
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.380]   they will always long for it again,
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.380]   and something that starts huge fundamental changes
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.380]   in people when we see that someone accepts us so deeply.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.400]   We start to accept ourselves,
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.100]   and the paradox is that's when big changes
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   start happening, big fundamental changes
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.700]   in people start happening.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.820]   So I think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship,
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.620]   that is, and that might be, in some way,
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.780]   the definition of love.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.620]   (laughing)
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.660]   - So acknowledging that there's a separate person
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.960]   and accepting you for who you are.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:02.420]   Now, on a slightly, and you mentioned therapeutic,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.140]   that sounds like a very healthy view of love,
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.260]   but is there also, like,
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.020]   if we look at heartbreak,
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.760]   and most love songs are probably about heartbreak, right?
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.080]   Is that, like, the mystery, the tension, the danger,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.880]   the fear of loss, you know, all of that,
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.560]   what people might see in the negative light
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.240]   as, like, games or whatever,
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   but just the dance of human interaction,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.400]   yeah, fear of loss, and fear of, like,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.160]   you said, like, once you feel it once,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.840]   you long for it again,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.760]   but you also, once you feel it once,
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.520]   for many people, they've lost it,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.280]   so they fear losing it, they feel lost.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.000]   So is that part of it?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.960]   Like, you're speaking, like, beautifully
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.640]   about, like, the positive things,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.480]   but is it important to be able to be afraid of losing it
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.960]   from an engineering perspective?
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.480]   (laughing)
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.800]   - I mean, it's a huge part of it,
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.280]   and unfortunately, we all, you know,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.880]   face it at some points in our lives.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.480]   I mean, I did.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.360]   - You wanna go into details?
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.040]   How'd you get your heart broken?
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   - Sure.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.000]   Well, so mine is pretty straight,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.920]   my story's pretty straightforward there.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.480]   I did have a friend that was, you know,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.960]   that at some point in my 20s
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.200]   became really, really close to me,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.080]   and we became really close friends.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.460]   Well, I grew up pretty lonely,
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.840]   so in many ways, when I'm building, you know,
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.560]   these AI friends, I'm thinking about myself
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.680]   when I was 17, writing horrible poetry,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   and, you know, in my dial-up modem at home,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   and, you know, and that was the feeling
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.160]   that I grew up with.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.320]   I lived alone for a long time when I was a teenager.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.480]   - Where did you grow up?
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.160]   - In Moscow, on the outskirts of Moscow.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.760]   So I'd just skateboard during the day
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.480]   and come back home and, you know,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.080]   connect to the internet.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:03.920]   - And write poetry.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.520]   - And then write horrible poetry.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   - Was it love poems?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   - All sorts of poems, obviously love poems.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.200]   I mean, what other poetry can you write when you're 17?
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.080]   - It could be political or something, but yeah.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.800]   - But that was, you know, that was kind of my,
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.480]   yeah, like deeply influenced by Joseph Brodsky
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.280]   and like all sorts of poets that
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.760]   every 17-year-old will be looking,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.240]   you know, looking at and reading.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.120]   But yeah, that was my, these were my teenage years,
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.760]   and I just never had a person that I thought
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.160]   would, you know, take me as it is,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.660]   would accept me the way I am.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.360]   And I just thought, you know, working and just doing my thing
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.720]   and being angry at the world and being a reporter,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.760]   I was an investigative reporter working undercover
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.160]   and writing about people was my way to connect with,
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.720]   you know, with others.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.920]   I was deeply curious about everyone else.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.160]   And I thought that, you know, if I go out there,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.920]   if I write their stories, that means I'm more connected.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.240]   - This is what this podcast is about, by the way.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.280]   I'm desperate, alone, seeking connection.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.760]   I'm just kidding, or am I?
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.080]   So wait, reporter,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.400]   how did that make you feel more connected?
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.120]   I mean, you're still fundamentally pretty alone.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.600]   - But you're always with other people, you know,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.240]   you're always thinking about what other place
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.760]   can I infiltrate, what other community can I write about,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   what other phenomenon can I explore?
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.560]   And you're sort of like a trickster, you know,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.040]   and a mythological creature
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.040]   that's just jumping between all sorts of different worlds
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.240]   and feel sort of okay in all of them.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.880]   So that was my dream job, by the way.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.360]   That was like totally what I would have been doing
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.880]   if Russia was a different place.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.240]   - And a little bit undercover.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.040]   So like you were trying to, like you said,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.280]   mythological creature trying to infiltrate.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.720]   So try to be a part of the world.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.680]   What are we talking about?
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.480]   What kind of things did you enjoy writing about?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.920]   - I'd go work at a strip club or go.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.640]   - Awesome, okay.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.960]   - Well, I'd go work at a restaurant
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   or just go write about certain phenomenons
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.720]   or phenomenons of people in the city.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.360]   - And what, sorry to keep interrupting.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   I'm the worst conversationalist.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.960]   What stage of Russia is this?
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.760]   What, is this pre-Putin, post-Putin?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.840]   What was Russia like?
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.080]   - Pre-Putin is really long ago.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.800]   This is Putin era.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   That's beginning of 2000s, 2010, 2007, eight, nine, 10.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.960]   - What were strip clubs like in Russia
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.520]   and restaurants and culture and people's minds
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.120]   like in that early Russia that you were covering?
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.200]   - In those early 2000s,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.320]   there was still a lot of hope.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.080]   There were still tons of hope that,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:11.320]   we're sort of becoming this Westernized society.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.720]   The restaurants were opening.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.840]   We were really looking at,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.120]   we're trying to copy a lot of things from the US,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.000]   from Europe, bringing all these things in,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   very enthusiastic about that.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.720]   So there was a lot of stuff going on.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.680]   There was a lot of hope and dream
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.080]   for this new Moscow that would be similar to,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.920]   I guess, New York.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.240]   I mean, just to give you an idea,
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   in year 2000 was the year when
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.000]   we had two movie theaters in Moscow
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.200]   and there was this one first coffee house that opened
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   and it was like really big deal.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.320]   By 2010, there were all sorts of things everywhere.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.040]   - Almost like a Starbucks type of coffee house
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.440]   or like you mean?
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.680]   - Oh yeah, like a Starbucks.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.240]   I mean, I remember we were reporting on,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.160]   we were writing about the opening of Starbucks,
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   I think in 2007.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.000]   That was one of the biggest things that happened
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.960]   in Moscow back in the time.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.840]   That was worthy of a magazine cover
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   and that was definitely the biggest talk of the town.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.360]   - Yeah, when was McDonald's?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.720]   'Cause I was still in Russia when McDonald's opened.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.080]   That was in the '90s.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.920]   I mean, yeah.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.400]   - Oh yeah, I remember that very well.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.240]   - Yeah.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   - Those were long, long lines.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.200]   I think it was 1993 or '94, I don't remember.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.960]   - Did you go to McDonald's at that time?
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.800]   Did you do the--
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.560]   - I mean, that was a luxurious outing.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   That was definitely not something you do every day.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.480]   And also the line was at least three hours.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.000]   So if you're going to McDonald's, that is not fast food.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.600]   That is like at least three hours in line.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.680]   And then no one is trying to eat fast after that.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.520]   Everyone is like trying to enjoy as much as possible.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.920]   - What's your memory of that?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.120]   - Oh, it was insane.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.520]   - Positive?
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   - Extremely positive.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.120]   It's a small strawberry milkshake and a hamburger
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.000]   and small fries and my mom's there.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.760]   And sometimes I'll just, 'cause I was really little,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.280]   they'll just let me run up the cashier and cut the line,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.480]   which is, you cannot really do that in Russia.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.720]   - So for a lot of people,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.400]   a lot of those experiences might seem not very fulfilling.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.120]   It's on the verge of poverty, I suppose.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.940]   But do you remember all that time fondly?
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.460]   Like, 'cause I do, like the first time I drank, you know,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.700]   Coke, you know, all that stuff, right?
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.340]   And just, yeah, the connection
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.260]   with other human beings in Russia,
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.940]   I remember really positively.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.580]   Like, how do you remember, well, the '90s
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.540]   and then the Russia you were covering,
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.700]   just the human connections you had with people
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.100]   and the experiences?
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.180]   - Well, my parents were both physicists.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.340]   My grandparents were both, well, my grandfather
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.340]   was a nuclear physicist, a professor at the university.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.780]   My dad worked at Chernobyl when I was born in Chernobyl,
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.180]   analyzing kind of everything after the explosion.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.140]   And then I remember that,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.700]   and so they were making sort of enough money
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.540]   in the Soviet Union,
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.500]   so they were not, you know, extremely poor or anything.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.020]   It was pretty prestigious to be a professor,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.260]   the dean in the university.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.740]   And then I remember my grandfather
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.740]   started making $100 a month after, you know, in the '90s.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.580]   So then I remember we started,
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.460]   our main line of work would be to go
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.100]   to our little tiny country house,
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.220]   get a lot of apples there from apple trees,
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   bring them back to the city and sell them in the street.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.780]   So me and my nuclear physicist grandfather
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.540]   were just standing there and he'd selling those apples
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.300]   the whole day, 'cause that would make you more money
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.620]   than, you know, working at the university.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.660]   And then he'll just tell me, try to teach me, you know,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.500]   something about planets and whatever,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.860]   the particles and stuff.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.460]   And, you know, I'm not smart at all,
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.940]   so I could never understand anything,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.420]   but I was interested as a, you know,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.900]   journalist kind of type interested.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.820]   But that was my memory.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   And, you know, I'm happy that I wasn't,
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.660]   I somehow got spared, that I was probably too young
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.340]   to remember any of the traumatic stuff.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.100]   So the only thing I really remember,
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.620]   I had this bootleg, that was very traumatic,
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.500]   had this bootleg Nintendo,
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.700]   which was called Dandy in Russia.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.660]   So in 1993, there was nothing to eat.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.980]   Like, even if you had any money, you would go to the store
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.860]   and there was no food.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.540]   I don't know if you remember that.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   And our friend had a restaurant, like a government,
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.860]   half government owned something restaurant.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.740]   So they always had supplies.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.620]   So he exchanged a big bag of wheat for this Nintendo,
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.940]   the bootleg Nintendo.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.900]   And that I remember very fondly,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.180]   'cause I think I was nine or something like that,
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.500]   and, or seven. - Why is that traumatic?
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.900]   - Well, 'cause we just got it and I was playing it
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.620]   and there was this, you know, Dandy TV show.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.460]   - Yeah.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.300]   So traumatic in a positive sense, you mean,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.620]   like a definitive?
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.460]   - Well, they took it away
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.380]   and gave me a bag of wheat instead.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.420]   And I cried like my eyes out for days and days and days.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.580]   - Oh no.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.540]   - And then, you know, as a,
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.500]   and my dad said, "We're gonna like exchange it back
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.340]   "in a little bit, so you keep the little gun."
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.820]   You know, the one that you shoot the ducks with?
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.040]   So I'm like, "Okay, I'm keeping the gun.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.980]   "So sometime it's gonna come back."
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.900]   But then they exchanged the gun as well
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.540]   for some sugar or something.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.700]   (laughing)
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.540]   I was so pissed.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.820]   I was like, I didn't wanna eat for days after that.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.780]   I'm like, "I don't want your food.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.580]   "I'm keeping my Nintendo back."
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.580]   (laughing)
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.940]   So that was extremely traumatic.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.440]   But, you know, I was happy
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.900]   that that was my only traumatic experience.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.740]   You know, my dad had to actually go to Chernobyl
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.620]   with a bunch of 20-year-olds.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.380]   He was 20 when he went to Chernobyl.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.760]   And that was right after the explosion.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.400]   No one knew anything.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.860]   The whole crew he went with, all of them are dead now.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.100]   I think there was this one guy still,
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.780]   that was still alive for this last few years.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.860]   I think he died a few years ago now.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.540]   My dad somehow luckily got back earlier than everyone else.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.220]   But just the fact that that was the,
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.020]   and I was always like, "Well, how did they send you?"
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.620]   I was only, I was just born.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.060]   You know, you had a newborn.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.740]   Talk about paternity leave.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.340]   They were like, "But that's who they took
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.780]   "'cause they didn't know whether you would be able
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.560]   "to have kids when you come back."
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.820]   So they took the ones with kids.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.260]   So he came with some guys, went to,
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.680]   and I'm just thinking of me when I was 20.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.300]   I was so sheltered from any problems whatsoever in life.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   And my dad, his 21st birthday at the reactor,
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.220]   you work three hours a day, you sleep the rest.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.500]   And yeah, so I played with a lot of toys from Chernobyl.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.700]   - What are your memories of Chernobyl in general?
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.380]   Like the bigger context, you know,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.400]   because of that HBO show,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.780]   the world's attention turned to it once again.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.740]   Like what are your thoughts about Chernobyl?
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.860]   Did Russia screw that one up?
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.300]   Like, you know, there's probably a lot of lessons
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.520]   about our modern times with data about coronavirus
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.500]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.860]   It seems like there's a lot of misinformation.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.860]   There's a lot of people kind of trying to hide
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.480]   whether they screwed something up or not.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.180]   As it's very understandable, it's very human,
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.700]   very wrong probably.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.900]   But obviously Russia was probably trying to hide
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.060]   that they screwed things up.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   Like what are your thoughts about that time,
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.340]   personal and general?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.060]   - I mean, I was born when the explosion happened.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.020]   So actually a few months after.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.240]   So of course I don't remember anything apart from the fact
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.940]   that my dad would bring me tiny toys,
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.660]   plastic things that would just go crazy,
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.340]   haywire when you put the Gager thing to it.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.220]   My mom was like just nuclear about that.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.540]   She was like, "What are you bringing?
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.420]   "You should not do that."
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.580]   - She was nuclear, very nice.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.740]   - Absolutely. - Well done.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.540]   - I'm sorry for that.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.900]   Well, but yeah, but the TV show was just phenomenal.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.820]   - HBO one?
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.060]   - Yeah, it's definitely, first of all,
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.940]   it's incredible how that was made,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.900]   not by the Russians, but someone else,
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   but capturing so well everything about our country.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.540]   It felt a lot more genuine
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.300]   than most of the movies and TV shows
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.020]   that are made now in Russia, just so much more genuine.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.460]   And most of my friends in Russia
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.460]   were just in complete awe about the show.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.300]   But I think the-- - How good of a job they did.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.140]   - My God, phenomenal.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.260]   - But also-- - The apartments,
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.940]   there's something, yeah.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.780]   - The set design. - Yes.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.020]   - I mean, Russians can't do that.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.980]   But you see everything and it's like,
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.100]   well, that's exactly how it was.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.480]   - It's so, I don't know, that show,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.020]   I don't know what to think about that
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.920]   'cause it's British accents, British actors.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.400]   Of a person, I forgot who created the show,
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.560]   but I remember reading about him and he's not,
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.240]   he doesn't even feel like,
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.440]   like there's no Russia in his history.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.360]   - No, he did like "Superbad" or some other show,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.240]   or like, I don't know.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   - Yeah, like, exactly.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.240]   - Whatever that thing about the bachelor party in Vegas,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.680]   number four and five or something
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.800]   were the ones that he worked on.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.720]   - Yeah, but so he, it made me feel really sad
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.200]   for some reason that if a person,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.560]   obviously a genius could go in and just study
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.040]   and just be extreme attention to detail,
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.240]   they can do a good job.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.320]   It made me think like,
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.440]   why don't other people do a good job with this?
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.200]   Like about Russia, like there's so little about Russia.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.280]   There's so few good films about
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.480]   the Russian side of World War II.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.040]   I mean, there's so much interesting evil
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.640]   and not, and beautiful moments in the history
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.240]   of the 20th century in Russia
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.000]   that it feels like there's not many good films on
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.840]   from the Russians.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.320]   You would expect something from the Russians.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.080]   - Well, they keep making these propaganda movies now.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:22.920]   - Oh no.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.080]   - Unfortunately, but yeah, no,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.560]   "Chernobyl" was such a perfect TV show.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.160]   I think capturing really well,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.480]   it's not about like even the set design,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.560]   which was phenomenal,
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.240]   but just capturing all the problems that exist now
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.920]   with the country and focusing on the right things.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.160]   Like if you build the whole country on a lie,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.880]   that's what's gonna happen.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.400]   And that's just this very simple kind of thing.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:51.440]   - Yeah, and did you have your dad talked about it to you?
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   Like his thoughts on the experience?
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.320]   - He never talks.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.920]   He's this kind of Russian man that just,
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.960]   my husband who's American,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.800]   and he asked him a few times,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.440]   Igor, how did you, but why did you say yes?
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.360]   Or like, why did you decide to go?
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.120]   You could have said no, not go to "Chernobyl."
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.360]   Why would like a person,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.800]   that's what you do.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.520]   You cannot say no.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.440]   - It's just, it's like a Russian way.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.280]   - It's the Russian way.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   - Men don't talk that much.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.120]   - No.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.880]   - There are downsides and upsides for that.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.400]   - Yeah, that's the truth.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.020]   Okay, so back to post-Putin Russia.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.060]   Or maybe we skipped a few steps along the way,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:42.060]   but you were trying to be a journalist in that time.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:46.260]   What was Russia like at that time?
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.260]   Post, you said 2007 Starbucks type of thing.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.260]   What else was Russia like then?
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.620]   - I think there was just hope.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.580]   There was this big hope that we're gonna be friends
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.980]   with the United States,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.660]   and we're gonna be friends with Europe,
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.460]   and we're just gonna be also a country like those
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.140]   with bike lanes and parks,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.460]   and everything's gonna be urbanized.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.540]   And again, we're talking about '90s
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.820]   where people would be shot in the street.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.180]   And that was, I sort of have a fond memory
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.500]   of going into a movie theater
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.900]   and coming out of it after the movie,
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.780]   and the guy that I saw on the stairs was like,
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.820]   neither shot, which was, again,
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.300]   it was like a thing in the '90s.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.140]   That would be happening.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.220]   People were getting shot here and there.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.420]   - Just violence.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:39.100]   - Tons of violence, tons of just basically mafia mobs
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.940]   in the streets.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.860]   And then the 2000s were like,
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.140]   things just got cleaned up, oil went up,
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.700]   and the country started getting a little bit richer.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.220]   The '90s were so grim,
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.140]   mostly because the economy was in shambles
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.820]   and oil prices were not high,
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.660]   so the country didn't have anything.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.540]   We defaulted in 1998,
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.740]   and the money kept jumping back and forth.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.220]   First there were millions of rubbles,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.700]   then it got to thousands,
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.620]   then it was one rubble was something,
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.660]   then again to millions.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.900]   It was like crazy town.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.860]   - That was crazy.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.020]   - And then the 2000s were just these years
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.140]   of stability in a way,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.500]   and the country getting a little bit richer
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.420]   because of, again, oil and gas.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.620]   And we started to look at,
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.100]   specifically in Moscow and St. Petersburg,
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:32.100]   to look at other cities in Europe and New York and US,
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.300]   and trying to do the same
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.900]   in our small kind of cities, towns there.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.100]   - What were your thoughts of Putin at the time?
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.180]   - Well, in the beginning he was really positive.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.940]   Everyone was very positive about Putin.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.420]   He was young, he was very energetic.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.620]   He also immediately-- - Hansel?
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.460]   The shirtless?
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.140]   - Well, somewhat compared to,
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.940]   well, that was not, like, way before the shirtless era.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.500]   - The shirtless era.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.860]   Okay, so he didn't start off shirtless.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   When did the shirtless era,
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.980]   it's like the propaganda of riding a horse, fishing.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.540]   - 2010, 11, 12.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.940]   - Yeah.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.980]   That's my favorite.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.260]   You know, like people talk about the favorite Beatles,
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.580]   like the, I don't know.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.900]   That's my favorite Putin, is the shirtless Putin.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.580]   - No, I remember very, very clearly 1996
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.660]   where Americans really helped Russia with elections
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.100]   and Yeltsin got reelected.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.140]   Thankfully so, because there was a huge threat
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.020]   that actually the communists will get back to power.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.220]   They were a lot more popular.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.660]   And then a lot of American experts, political experts,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.220]   and campaign experts descended on Moscow
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.380]   and helped Yeltsin actually get the presidency,
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.860]   the second term of the presidency.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.740]   But Yeltsin was not feeling great, you know,
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.820]   by the end of his second term.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.340]   He was, you know, alcoholic, he was really old.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.780]   He was falling off, you know,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.660]   the stages where he was talking.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.740]   So people were looking for fresh,
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.980]   I think for a fresh face,
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   for someone who's gonna continue Yeltsin's work,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.420]   but who's gonna be a lot more energetic
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.420]   and a lot more active, young, efficient maybe.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.700]   So that's what we all saw in Putin back in the day.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.860]   I'd say that everyone,
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.100]   absolutely everyone in Russia in early 2000s
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.380]   who was not a communist would be,
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.340]   yeah, Putin's great.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.900]   We have a lot of hopes for him.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.500]   - What are your thoughts,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.700]   and I promise we'll get back to,
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.220]   first of all, your love story,
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.060]   and second of all, AI,
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.220]   but what are your thoughts about communism?
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.740]   The 20th century, I apologize,
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.420]   I'm reading the "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.260]   - Oh my God.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.020]   - So I'm like really steeped into like World War II
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:58.500]   and Stalin and Hitler and just these dramatic personalities
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.580]   that brought so much evil to the world.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.020]   But it's also interesting to politically think
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.060]   about these different systems and what they've led to.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:13.060]   And Russia is one of the sort of beacons of communism
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.220]   in the 20th century.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.660]   What are your thoughts about communism?
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.540]   Having experienced it as a political system?
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.460]   - I mean, I have only experienced it a little bit,
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.380]   but mostly through stories and through seeing my parents,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.180]   my grandparents who lived through that.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.380]   It was horrible.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.700]   It was just plain horrible.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.340]   It was just awful.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.860]   - You think there's something,
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.900]   I mean, it sounds nice on paper.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.180]   - Maybe.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.660]   - So like the drawbacks of capitalism is that
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.660]   eventually it's the point of like a slippery slope.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.500]   Eventually it creates,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.740]   the rich get richer.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   It creates a disparity, like inequality of wealth inequality.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.420]   I guess it's hypothetical at this point,
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.700]   but eventually capitalism leads to humongous inequality.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.660]   And that's, some people argue that
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.300]   that's a source of unhappiness.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.580]   Is it's not like absolute wealth of people.
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.820]   It's the fact that there's a lot of people
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.100]   much richer than you.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.500]   There's a feeling of like,
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.180]   that's where unhappiness can come from.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.100]   So the idea of communism, or at least sort of Marxism
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   is not allowing that kind of slippery slope.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.220]   But then you see the actual implementations of it
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.940]   and stuff seems to go wrong very badly.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.780]   What do you think that is?
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.900]   Why does it go wrong?
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.860]   What is it about human nature?
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.340]   If we look at Chernobyl,
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.620]   those kinds of bureaucracies that were constructed,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.980]   is there something like,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.100]   do you think about this much of like why it goes wrong?
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.340]   - Well, there's no one was really like,
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.340]   it's not that everyone was equal.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:10.020]   Obviously the government and everyone close to that
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.060]   were the bosses.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.860]   So it's not like fully, I guess.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.700]   - There's already inequality.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.660]   - This dream of equal life.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.660]   So then I guess the situation that we had,
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.140]   the Russia had in the Soviet Union,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.820]   it was more, it's a bunch of really poor people
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.820]   without any way to make any significant fortune
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.660]   or build anything, living constant,
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.860]   under constant surveillance, surveillance from other people.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.380]   Like you can't even do anything
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.860]   that's not fully approved by the dictatorship basically.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.220]   Otherwise your neighbor will write a letter
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.740]   and you'll go to jail.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.540]   Absolute absence of actual law.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.380]   - Yeah.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.540]   - It's a constant state of fear.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.140]   You didn't own anything.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.060]   You couldn't go travel.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.900]   You couldn't read anything Western
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.060]   or you couldn't make a career really,
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.340]   unless you're working in the military complex.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.580]   Which is why most of the scientists were so well-regarded.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   I come from, both my dad and my mom
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.740]   come from families of scientists
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.260]   and they were really well-regarded as you know, obviously.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.180]   - 'Cause the state wanted, I mean,
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.780]   'cause there's a lot of value to them being well-regarded.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.940]   - Because they were developing things
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.420]   that could be used in the military.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.540]   So that was very important.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.980]   That was the main investment.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.700]   But it was miserable.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.100]   It was miserable.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.740]   That's why a lot of Russians now live
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.460]   in the state of constant PTSD.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.980]   That's why we want to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.180]   Definitely, as soon as we have the opportunity,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.740]   we just got to it finally that we can own things.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.660]   I remember the time that we got our first yogurts
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.260]   and that was the biggest deal in the world.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.180]   It was already in the '90s by the way.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.900]   - What was your favorite food
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.780]   where it was like, "Whoa, this is possible."
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.260]   - Oh, fruit, because we only had apples, bananas
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.940]   and whatever, watermelons,
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.500]   whatever people would grow in the Soviet Union.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.260]   So there were no pineapples or papaya or mango.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.140]   Like you've never seen those fruit things.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.260]   Like those were so ridiculously good.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.540]   And obviously you could not get any like strawberries
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.620]   in winter or anything that's not seasonal.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.860]   So that was a really big deal,
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.660]   seeing all these fruit things.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.780]   - Yeah, me too, actually.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.620]   I don't know.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.780]   I think I have a,
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.100]   like I don't think I have too many demons
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.100]   or like addictions or so on,
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.220]   but I think I've developed an unhealthy relationship
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.300]   with fruit that I still struggle with.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.820]   - Oh, you can get any type of fruit, right?
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.740]   You can get like, also these weird fruit,
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.460]   fruits like dragon fruit or something.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.180]   - All kinds of like different types of peaches.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.140]   Like cherries were killer for me.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.900]   I know you say like we had bananas and so on,
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   but I don't remember having the kind of banana.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.020]   Like when I first came to this country,
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.300]   the amount of banana,
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.740]   I like literally got fat on bananas.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.460]   (Bridget laughing)
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.580]   Like the amount.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.660]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.500]   - They're delicious.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.780]   And like cherries, the kind,
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.260]   like just the quality of the food.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.100]   I was like, this is capitalism.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.300]   This is delicious.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:29.960]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.740]   It's funny.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   Yeah, like it's funny to read.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.420]   I don't know what to think of it.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.940]   It's funny to think how an idea
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.020]   that's just written on paper,
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.780]   when carried out amongst millions of people,
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.180]   how that gets actually,
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.220]   when it becomes reality,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.740]   what it actually looks like.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:00.660]   Sorry, but I've been studying Hitler a lot recently
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.080]   and going through Mein Kampf.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.980]   He pretty much wrote out in Mein Kampf
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.900]   everything he was gonna do.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.060]   Unfortunately, most leaders,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.900]   including Stalin, didn't read it.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.980]   But it's kind of terrifying and I don't know.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.620]   And amazing in some sense
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.420]   that you can have some words on paper
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.900]   and they can be brought to life
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.580]   and they can either inspire the world
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.420]   or they can destroy the world.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.340]   And yeah, there's a lot of lessons to study in history
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.900]   that I think people don't study enough now.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.980]   One of the things I'm hoping with,
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.140]   I've been practicing Russian a little bit.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.500]   I'm hoping to sort of find,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.260]   rediscover the beauty and the terror of Russian history
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:54.500]   through this stupid podcast by talking to a few people.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.340]   So anyway, I just feel like so much was forgotten.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.020]   So much was forgotten.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.700]   I'll probably, I'm gonna try to convince myself
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.780]   that you're a super busy and super important person.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.460]   Well, I'm gonna try to befriend you
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:12.020]   to try to become a better Russian
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.060]   'cause I feel like I'm a shitty Russian.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.340]   - Not that busy.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.640]   So I can totally be your Russian Sherpa.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.800]   - Yeah, but love.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   You're talking about your early days
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.680]   of being a little bit alone
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.080]   and finding a connection with the world
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.120]   through being a journalist.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.080]   Where did love come into that?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:40.000]   - I guess finding for the first time some friends.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.560]   It's very simple story.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.720]   Some friends that all of a sudden we,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.640]   I guess we were at the same place with our lives.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   We're 25, 26, I guess.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.380]   And somehow remember, and we just got really close
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.520]   and somehow remember this one day where,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.200]   it's one day in summer that we just stayed out,
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.140]   outdoor the whole night and just talked.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.980]   And for some unknown reason,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.580]   it just felt for the first time that someone could,
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.980]   see me for who I am.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.820]   And it just felt extremely, like extremely good.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.660]   And we fell asleep outside and just talking
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.700]   and it was raining, it was beautiful, sunrise.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.380]   It's really cheesy, but at the same time,
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.420]   we just became friends in a way that I've never been friends
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.720]   with anyone else before.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.340]   And I do remember that before and after
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.120]   that you sort of have this unconditional family sort of,
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.300]   and it gives you tons of power.
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.240]   It just basically gives you this tremendous power
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   to do things in your life and to change positively.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.680]   - You mean like-- - On many different levels.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   - Power because you could be yourself.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.440]   - At least you know that somewhere you can be just yourself.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.480]   Like you don't need to pretend,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.320]   you don't need to be great at work or tell some story
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.240]   or sell yourself in somewhere or another.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.000]   And so we became this really close friends.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   And in a way I started a company 'cause he had a startup
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.200]   and I felt like I kind of want to start up too.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.400]   And it felt really cool.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.680]   I don't know what I would really do,
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.960]   but I felt like I would kind of need to start up.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   - Okay, so that pulled you in to the startup world.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.040]   - Yeah, and then this closest friend of mine died.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.320]   We actually moved here to San Francisco together
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.000]   and then we went back for a visa to Moscow
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.360]   and we lived together, we're roommates.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.040]   And we came back and he got hit by a car
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.600]   right in front of Kremlin, next to the river
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.720]   and died the same day in the hospital.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.560]   - This is Roman?
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.400]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.240]   - This is Roman.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.120]   And you've moved to America at that point?
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.960]   - At that point I was living--
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.640]   - What about him, what about Roman?
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.920]   - Him too, he actually moved first.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.080]   So I was always sort of trying to do what he was doing.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.600]   So I didn't like that he was already here
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.400]   and I was still in Moscow
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.480]   and we weren't hanging out together all the time.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.320]   - Was he in San Francisco?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.480]   - Yeah, we were roommates.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.400]   - So he just visited Moscow for a little bit?
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.880]   - We went back for our visas.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.160]   We had to get a stamp and our passport for our work visas
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.400]   and the embassy was taking a little longer
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.300]   so we stayed there for a couple weeks.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.400]   - What happened?
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:39.560]   So how did he die?
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.400]   - He was crossing the street
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.920]   and the car was going really fast
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.680]   and way over the speed limit
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.840]   and just didn't stop on the pedestrian cross on the zebra
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.240]   and just ran over him.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.040]   - When was this?
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.240]   - It was in 2015 on 28th of November
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.240]   so it was pretty long ago now.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.800]   But at the time I was 29
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   so for me it was the first kind of meaningful death
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.860]   in my life.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:12.880]   I had both sets of grandparents at the time.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.840]   I didn't see anyone so close die
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.520]   and death sort of existed but as a concept
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.720]   but definitely not as something that would be
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.120]   happening to us anytime soon.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.440]   And specifically our friends
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.960]   'cause we were still in our 20s or early 30s
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.040]   and it still felt like the whole life is,
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.420]   you could still dream about ridiculous things.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:42.600]   So it was just really, really abrupt I'd say.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.520]   - What did it feel like to lose him?
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.680]   Like that feeling of loss.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.800]   You talked about the feeling of love, having power.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.180]   What is the feeling of loss feel like?
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.800]   - Well in Buddhism there's this concept of samaya
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   where something really huge happens
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.260]   and then you can see very clearly.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.800]   I think that was it.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.320]   Basically something changed me so much
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.920]   in such a short period of time
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.800]   that I could just see really clearly
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.200]   what mattered or what not.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.760]   Well I definitely saw that whatever I was doing at work
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.600]   didn't matter at all and some of the things.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.040]   And it was just this big realization,
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.360]   this very, very clear vision of what life's about.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.740]   - You still miss him today?
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.200]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.800]   For sure.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.300]   It was just this constant,
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.800]   I think he was really important for me and for our friends
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.040]   for many different reasons.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.640]   And I think one of them,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.280]   being that we didn't just say goodbye to him
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.120]   but we sort of said goodbye to our youth in a way.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.000]   It was like the end of an era
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.320]   and on so many different levels.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.440]   The end of Moscow as we knew it,
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.500]   the end of us living through our 20s
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.500]   and kind of dreaming about the future.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.240]   - Do you remember last several conversations?
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.800]   Is there moments with him that stick out
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   that will kind of haunt you?
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.000]   And just when you think about him?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.920]   - Yeah, well his last year here in San Francisco
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.040]   he was pretty depressed as his startup
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.240]   was not going really anywhere.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.600]   And he wanted to do something else.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.380]   He wanted to build,
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:38.880]   he played with a bunch of ideas
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.360]   but the last one he had was around
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.480]   building a startup around death.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.160]   So having, he applied to Y Combinator
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.140]   with a video that I had on my computer.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.320]   And it was all about disrupting death,
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.680]   thinking about new symmetries, more biologically.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.360]   Like things that could be better biologically for humans.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.840]   And at the same time having those digital avatars,
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.120]   these kind of AI avatars that would store all the memory
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.840]   about a person that he could interact with.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.040]   - What year was this?
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.480]   - 2015.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.200]   Well right before his death.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.720]   So it was like a couple months before that
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.640]   he recorded that video.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.200]   And so I found it on my computer
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.120]   when it was in our living room.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:33.040]   He never got in but he was thinking about it a lot somehow.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.020]   - Does it have the digital avatar idea?
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.160]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.000]   - That's so interesting.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.520]   - Well he just says, well that's in his,
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   yeah, Depeche has this idea and he talks about
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.200]   like I want to rethink how people grieve
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.120]   and how people talk about death.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.720]   - Why was he interested in this?
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.280]   - Maybe someone who's depressed
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.040]   is like naturally inclined thinking about that.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.880]   But I just felt, you know, this year in San Francisco
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.920]   we just had so much,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.640]   I was going through a hard time,
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.560]   he was going through a hard time,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.380]   and we were definitely, I was trying to make him
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.840]   just happy somehow, just make him feel better.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.600]   And it felt like, you know, this,
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.540]   I don't know, I just felt like I was taking care
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.420]   of him a lot.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.900]   And he almost started to feel better
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.560]   and then that happened.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.560]   And I don't know, I just felt lonely again, I guess.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.980]   And that was, you know, coming back to San Francisco
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:29.380]   in December, I helped organize the funeral,
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.620]   helped his parents.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.480]   And then I came back here and it was a really
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.680]   lonely apartment, a bunch of his clothes everywhere,
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.200]   and Christmas time.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.000]   And I remember I had a board meeting with my investors
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.440]   and I just couldn't talk about like,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.800]   had to pretend everything's okay
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.320]   and, you know, just working on this company.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:54.060]   Yeah, it was definitely a very, very tough, tough time.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:58:00.120]   - Do you think about your own mortality?
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.960]   You said, you know, we're young,
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.900]   the possibility of doing all kinds of crazy things
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.920]   is still out there, it's still before us,
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.900]   but it can end any moment.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.200]   Do you think about your own ending at any moment?
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.960]   - Unfortunately, I think about it way too much.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:26.480]   It's somehow after Roman, like every year after that,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.620]   I started losing people that I really love.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.800]   I lost my grandfather the next year.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.000]   You know, the person who would explain to me,
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.240]   you know, what the universe is made of.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.480]   - While you're selling apples?
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.240]   - While selling apples, and then I lost
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.680]   another close friend of mine.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.720]   And it just made me very scared.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.360]   I have tons of fear about death.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.540]   That's what makes me not fall asleep oftentimes
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.600]   and just go in loops.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.400]   And then as my therapist, you know, recommended me,
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   I open up some nice calming images
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.400]   with a voiceover and it calms me down.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.300]   - Oh, for sleep?
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.520]   - Yeah, I'm really scared of death.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.160]   This is a big, I definitely have tons of,
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.500]   I guess some pretty big trauma about it
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.160]   and I'm still working through.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.320]   - There's a philosopher, Ernest Becker,
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.040]   who wrote a book, "The Nile of Death."
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.480]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with any of those books.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.160]   There's in psychology a whole field
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.280]   called terror management theory.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.240]   Sheldon, who's just done the podcast, he wrote the book.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.180]   He was the, we talked for four hours about death.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.940]   Fear of death.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.360]   But his whole idea is that, Ernest Becker,
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.800]   I think I find this idea really compelling
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.320]   is that everything human beings have created,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.520]   like our whole motivation in life
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.520]   is to create, like escape death.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.360]   It's to try to construct an illusion
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.000]   of that we're somehow immortal.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.160]   So everything around us, this room,
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.080]   your startup, your dreams, all, everything you do
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   is a kind of creation of a brain,
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.880]   unlike any other mammal or species,
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.180]   is able to be cognizant of the fact that it ends for us.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.000]   I think, so there's the question of the meaning of life
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   that you look at what drives us, humans.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.520]   And when I read Ernest Becker
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.360]   that I highly recommend people read,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.300]   is the first time I, it felt like this is the right thing
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.800]   at the core.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.000]   Sheldon's work is called Warm at the Core.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.480]   So he's saying, I think it's William James,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.160]   he's quoting or whoever, is like the thing,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.600]   what is at the core of it all?
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.200]   Sure, there's like love, you know,
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.040]   Jesus might talk about like love
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.440]   is at the core of everything.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.480]   I don't, you know, that's the open question.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.260]   What's at the, you know, it's turtles, turtles,
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.800]   but it can't be turtles all the way down.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.140]   What's at the bottom?
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.920]   And Ernest Becker says the fear of death.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.300]   And the way, in fact,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.320]   'cause you said therapist and calming images,
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.600]   his whole idea is, you know,
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.860]   we wanna bring that fear of death as close as possible
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.360]   to the surface because it's, and like meditate on that
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.380]   and use the clarity of vision that provides
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.080]   to live a more fulfilling life,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.680]   to live a more honest life,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.120]   to discover, you know,
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.400]   there's something about, you know,
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.280]   being cognizant of the finiteness of it all
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   that might result in the most fulfilling life.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.520]   So that's the dual of what you're saying
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.680]   'cause you kind of said it's like,
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.920]   I unfortunately think about it too much.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.700]   It's a question whether it's good to think about it.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.460]   'Cause I've, again, I talk way too much about love
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.980]   and probably death.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.560]   And when I ask people or friends,
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.400]   which is why I probably don't have many friends,
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.900]   are you afraid of death?
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.680]   I think most people say they're not.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.660]   They're not, what they say they're afraid,
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.340]   you know, it's kind of almost like they see death
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.920]   as this kind of like a paper deadline or something
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.280]   and they're afraid not to finish the paper before the paper,
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   like I'm afraid not to finish the goals I have,
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.320]   but it feels like they're not actually realizing
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.080]   that this thing ends, like really realizing,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.280]   like really thinking, as Nietzsche and all these philosophers
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.940]   like thinking deeply about it.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.980]   Like the very thing that, you know,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.860]   like when you think deeply about something,
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:20.140]   you can realize that you haven't actually thought about it.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.700]   Yeah, and when I think about death,
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.420]   it's like, it can be, it's terrifying.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.260]   It feels like stepping outside into the cold
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.140]   or it's freezing and then I have to like hurry back inside
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:35.960]   or it's warm.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.100]   (laughs)
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.620]   But like, I think there's something valuable
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.600]   about stepping out there into the freezing cold.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.220]   - Most definitely.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.660]   When I talk to my mentor about it,
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.660]   he always tells me, "Well, what dies?
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.460]   "There's nothing there that can die."
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:59.500]   But I guess that requires-- - What do you mean?
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.340]   - Well, in Buddhism, one of the concepts
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.300]   that are really hard to grasp
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.100]   and that people spend all their lives meditating on
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:11.100]   would be anatta, which is the concept of non-self.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.680]   And kind of thinking that, you know,
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.960]   if you're not your thoughts,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.180]   which you're obviously not your thoughts
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.200]   'cause you can observe them and not your emotions
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.860]   and not your body, then what is this?
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.860]   And if you go really far, then finally you see that
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.260]   there's not self, there's this concept of not self.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:32.140]   So once you get there, how can that actually die?
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.260]   What is dying? (laughs)
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.240]   - Right, you're just a bunch of molecules, stardust.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:43.780]   - But that is very advanced spiritual work for me.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.260]   - Does that help you sleep? - I'm definitely just,
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.660]   definitely not.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.660]   Oh my God, no, I have, I think it's very, very useful.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.180]   It's just the fact that maybe being so afraid is not useful.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.420]   And mine is more, I'm just terrified.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.340]   Like, it really makes me-- - On a personal level.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.420]   - On a personal level.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.820]   I'm terrified.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.940]   - How do you overcome that?
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.780]   - I don't.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.960]   I'm still trying to.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.580]   - Have pleasant images?
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.600]   - Well, pleasant images get me to sleep.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.440]   And then during the day, I can distract myself
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440]   with other things, like talking to you.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.600]   - I'm glad we're both doing the same exact thing.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.900]   Okay, good. (laughs)
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.980]   (laughs)
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:35.860]   Is there other, like, is there moments
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:40.620]   since you've lost Roman that you had moments of bliss
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:44.840]   and that you've forgotten,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.960]   that you have achieved that Buddhist level of,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.420]   what can possibly die?
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.660]   I'm part, like, losing yourself in the moment,
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:00.660]   in the ticking time of, like, this universe,
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.460]   and you're just part of it for a brief moment
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.920]   and just enjoying it.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.260]   - Well, that goes hand in hand.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.060]   I remember, I think a day or two after he died,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.500]   we went to finally get his passport out of the embassy,
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.100]   and we're driving around Moscow, and it was December,
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.780]   which is usually, there's never sun in Moscow in December.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.420]   And somehow, it was an extremely sunny day,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.800]   and we were driving with a close friend.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.620]   And I remember feeling, for the first time,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.540]   maybe this just moment of incredible clarity
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:40.540]   and somehow happiness, not, like, happy happiness,
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.300]   but happiness, and just feeling that, you know,
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.060]   I know what the universe is sort of about,
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.740]   whether it's good or bad.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.700]   And it wasn't a sad feeling.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.060]   It was probably the most beautiful feeling
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.940]   that you can ever achieve.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.300]   And you can only get it when something,
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.180]   oftentimes, when something traumatic like that happens.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.780]   But also, if you just, you really spend a lot of time
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.140]   meditating and looking at the nature,
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.800]   doing something that really gets you there.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.020]   But once you're there, I think when you summit a mountain,
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.020]   a really hard mountain, you inevitably get there.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.420]   That's just a way to get to the state.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.360]   But once you're in this state,
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   you can do really big things, I think.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.840]   - Yeah.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.000]   Sucks that it doesn't last forever.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.540]   So Bukowski talked about, like, love is a fog.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:36.720]   It's when you wake up in the morning, it's there,
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.160]   but it eventually dissipates.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.200]   It's really sad.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.440]   Nothing lasts forever.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.480]   But I definitely like doing this pushup and running thing.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.720]   There's moments, I had a couple moments.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.440]   Like, I'm not a crier, I don't cry.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.360]   But there's moments where I was, like,
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:59.160]   facedown on the carpet, like, with tears in my eyes.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.000]   It's interesting.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   And then that complete, like, there's a lot of demons.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.520]   I've got demons, had to face them.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.440]   Funny how running makes you face your demons.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.480]   But at the same time, the flip side of that,
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.020]   there's a few moments where I was in bliss.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.020]   And all of it alone, which is funny.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.940]   - That's beautiful.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.540]   I like that.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.460]   But definitely pushing yourself physically,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.820]   one of it, for sure.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.700]   - Yeah, it's, yeah.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.780]   Like you said, I mean, you were speaking
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.620]   as a metaphor of Mount Everest,
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.420]   but it also works, like, literally.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.540]   I think physical endeavor somehow.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.740]   Yeah, there's something.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.220]   I mean, we're monkeys, apes, whatever.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.620]   Physical, there's a physical thing to it.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.180]   But there's something to this,
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.220]   pushing yourself physically, but alone.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.380]   That happens when you're doing, like, things like you do,
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.220]   or strenuous, like, workouts,
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:01.220]   or, you know, rowing across the Atlantic, or, like, marathons.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.380]   That's why I love watching marathons.
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.460]   And, you know, it's so boring.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.420]   But you can see them getting there.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.100]   - So the other thing, I don't know if you know,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.800]   there's a guy named David Goggins.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:17.340]   He's a, he basically,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.340]   so he's been either emailing on the phone with me
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.180]   every day through this.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.100]   I haven't been exactly alone,
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.000]   but he's kind of,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.620]   he's the devil on the devil's shoulder.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.920]   So he's, like, the worst possible human being
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.340]   in terms of giving you advice.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Like, he has, through everything I've been doing,
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.740]   he's been doubling everything I do.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.220]   So he's insane.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.460]   He's this Navy SEAL person.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.260]   He's wrote this book, "Can't Hurt Me."
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.580]   He's basically one of the toughest human beings on earth.
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:54.420]   He ran all these crazy ultra marathons in the desert.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.860]   He set the world record in the number of pull-ups.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.060]   He just does everything where it's like,
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.580]   he, like, how can I suffer today?
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.820]   He figures that out and does it.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.880]   Yeah, that, whatever that is,
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.940]   that process of self-discovery is really important.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.180]   I actually had to turn myself off from the internet, mostly,
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.880]   'cause I started this workout thing,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.300]   like a happy go-getter,
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.100]   with my headband and, like,
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:25.900]   just, like, 'cause a lot of people were inspired
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.580]   and they're like, "Yeah, we're gonna exercise with you."
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.660]   And I was, "Yeah, great."
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.740]   But then, like, I realized that this journey
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.580]   can't be done together with others.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.120]   This has to be done alone.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.820]   - So, out of the moments of love,
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.220]   out of the moments of loss,
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.780]   can we talk about your journey of finding, I think,
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.860]   an incredible idea, an incredible company,
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.200]   and incredible system in Replika?
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.340]   How did that come to be?
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.260]   - So, yeah, so I was a journalist,
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.940]   and then I went to business school for a couple of years
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.660]   to just see if I can maybe switch gears
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.620]   and do something else at 23.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.020]   And then I came back and started working
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.340]   for a businessman in Russia
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:20.340]   who built the first 4G network in our country,
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.580]   and was very visionary,
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.540]   and asked me whether I wanna do fun stuff together.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.820]   And we worked on a bank.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.980]   The idea was to build a bank on top of a telco.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.980]   So that was 2011 or '12,
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.440]   and a lot of telecommunications company,
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.320]   mobile network operators,
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   didn't really know what to do next
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.560]   in terms of new products, new revenue.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.080]   And this big idea was that you put a bank on top,
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.120]   and then all works out.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.520]   Basically, a prepaid account becomes your bank account,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.220]   and you can use it as your bank.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:04.800]   So, a third of a country wakes up as your bank client.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.800]   But we couldn't quite figure out
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.160]   what would be the main interface to interact with a bank.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.920]   The problem was that most people didn't have smartphones
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.040]   back in the time.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.180]   In Russia, the penetration of smartphones was low.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.880]   People didn't use mobile banking
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.520]   or online banking on their computers.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.840]   So we figured out that SMS would be the best way,
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.280]   'cause that would work on feature phones.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.960]   But that required some chatbot technology,
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.800]   which I didn't know anything about, obviously.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.960]   So I started looking into it
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.160]   and saw that there's nothing really,
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.000]   well, there was just nothing really.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.520]   - So the idea is through SMS,
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.720]   be able to interact with your bank account.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.800]   - Yeah, and then we thought,
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.840]   well, since you're talking to a bank account,
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.200]   why can't we use more of some behavioral ideas,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.600]   and why can't this banking chatbot be nice to you
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.200]   and really talk to you sort of as a friend?
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.440]   This way, you develop more connection to it.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.840]   Retention's higher, people don't churn.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.320]   And so I went to very depressing Russian cities
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.520]   to test it out.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.840]   I went to, I remember, three different towns
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:13.560]   to interview potential users.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.960]   So people use it for a little bit.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.800]   - Cool.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.520]   - And I went to talk to them.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.480]   - So pretty poor towns.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.560]   - Very poor towns, mostly towns that were
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:26.800]   sort of factories, monotowns.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.120]   They were building something,
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.320]   and then the factory went away,
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.820]   and it was just a bunch of very poor people.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.160]   And then we went to a couple that weren't as dramatic,
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.200]   but still, the one I remember really fondly
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.040]   was this woman that worked at a glass factory,
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.400]   and she talked to a chatbot,
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.000]   and she was talking about it,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.480]   and she started crying during the interview,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.000]   'cause she said, "No one really cares for me that much."
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.600]   And so to be clear,
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.920]   that was my only endeavor in programming that chatbot.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.640]   So it was really simple.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.440]   It was literally just a few if this, then that rules,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.920]   and it was incredibly simplistic.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.560]   - And still, that made her feel something.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.080]   - And that really made her emotional,
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.920]   and she said, "I only have my mom and my husband,
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.160]   "and I don't have any more, really, in my life."
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.440]   And it was very sad, but at the same time, I felt,
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.380]   and we had more interviews in a similar vein,
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.160]   and what I thought in the moment was,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.360]   "Well, it's not that the technology is ready,"
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.600]   'cause definitely in 2012,
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.120]   technology was not ready for that,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.680]   but humans are ready, unfortunately.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.800]   So this project would not be about tech capabilities.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.400]   It would be more about human vulnerabilities,
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.120]   but there's something so powerful
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   around about conversational AI that I saw then
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.320]   that I thought was definitely worth putting
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.760]   a lot of effort into.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.560]   So in the end of the day, we solved the banking project,
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.240]   but my then boss, who's also my mentor
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.000]   and really, really close friend,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.320]   told me, "Hey, I think there's something in it,
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.960]   "and you should just go work on it."
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.380]   And I was like, "Well, what product?
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.680]   "I don't know what I'm building."
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.760]   He's like, "You'll figure it out."
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.120]   And looking back at this,
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.880]   this was a horrible idea to work on something
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.240]   without knowing what it was,
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.760]   which is maybe the reason why it took us so long,
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.880]   but we just decided to work on the conversational tech
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.880]   to see what it, there were no chatbot constructors
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.220]   or programs or anything that would allow you
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.920]   to actually build one at the time.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.020]   That was the era of, by the way, Google Glass,
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.160]   which is why some of the investors,
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.280]   like seed investors we talked with were like,
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.080]   "Oh, you should totally build it for Google Glass.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.720]   "If not, we're not."
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.520]   I don't think that's interesting.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.240]   - Did you bite on that idea?
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.040]   - No. - Okay.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.320]   - Because I wanted to do text first,
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.680]   because I'm a journalist,
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.100]   so I was fascinated by just texting.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.840]   - So you thought, so the emotional,
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.120]   that interaction that the woman had,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.220]   so do you think you could feel emotion from just text?
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.320]   - Yeah, I saw something in just this pure texting
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.680]   and also thought that we should first start building
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.040]   for people who really need it
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.440]   versus people who have Google Glass,
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.280]   if you know what I mean.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.680]   And I felt like the early adopters of Google Glass
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.440]   might not be overlapping with people who are really lonely
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.720]   and might need someone to talk to.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.040]   But then we really just focused on the tech itself.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.720]   We just thought, what if we just,
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.300]   we didn't have a product idea in the moment,
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.440]   and we felt, what if we just look into
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.320]   building the best conversational constructor, so to say.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.360]   We used the best tech available at the time,
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.560]   and that was before the first paper
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.360]   about deep learning applied to dialogues,
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.200]   which happened in 2015, in August 2015,
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.080]   which Google published.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.400]   - Did you follow the work of Lobner Prize
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   and all the non-machine learning chatbots?
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.840]   - Yeah, what really struck me was that
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.160]   there was a lot of talk about machine learning
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.080]   and deep learning, like big data was a really big thing.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.920]   Everyone was saying, in the business world, big data.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.320]   2012's the biggest.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.040]   Kaggle competitions were important.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.760]   But that was really the upheaval.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.600]   People started talking about machine learning a lot.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.400]   But it was only about images or something else,
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.800]   and it was never about conversation.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.680]   As soon as I looked into the conversational tech,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.840]   it was all about something really weird and very outdated
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.920]   and very marginal and felt very hobbyist.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.160]   It was all about Lobner Prize,
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.640]   which was won by a guy who built a chatbot
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.920]   that talked like a Ukrainian teenager.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.960]   It was just a gimmick.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.880]   And somehow people picked up those gimmicks.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.680]   And then the most famous chatbot at the time
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.480]   was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre,
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.560]   or Smarter Child on AIM.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.280]   - The funny thing is it felt at the time
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.260]   not to be that popular,
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.360]   and it still doesn't seem to be that popular.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.760]   People talk about the Turing test.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.400]   People talk about it philosophically.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.360]   Journalists like writing about it.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.540]   But it's a technical problem.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.540]   People don't seem to really wanna solve the open dialogue.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:29.480]   Like, they're not obsessed with it.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.200]   Even folks like in Boston, the Alexa team,
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.160]   even they're not as obsessed with it
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.960]   as I thought they might be.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.800]   - Why not?
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.640]   What do you think?
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.080]   - So you know what you felt like you felt with that woman
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.320]   when she felt something by reading the text?
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.720]   I feel the same thing.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.620]   There's something here, what you felt.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:56.520]   I feel like Alexa folks and just the machine learning world
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.140]   doesn't feel that, that there's something here.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.700]   Because they see as a technical problem,
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.920]   it's not that interesting for some reason.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.760]   It could be argued that maybe isn't
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.060]   as a purely sort of natural language processing problem,
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.580]   it's not the right problem to focus on
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.860]   'cause there's too much subjectivity.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.360]   That thing that the woman felt like crying,
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.360]   like if your benchmark includes a woman crying,
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.020]   that doesn't feel like a good benchmark,
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.160]   that's a good test.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.740]   But to me, there's something there.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.300]   You could have a huge impact,
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.300]   but I don't think the machine learning world likes that,
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.120]   the human emotion, the subjectivity of it, the fuzziness.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.940]   The fact that with maybe a single word,
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.600]   you can make somebody feel something deeply.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.620]   What is that?
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.520]   That doesn't feel right to them.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.360]   So I don't know.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.020]   I don't know why that is.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.220]   That's why I'm excited.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:55.820]   When I discovered your work,
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.900]   it feels wrong to say that.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.980]   It's not like I'm...
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.220]   (laughing)
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.540]   I'm giving myself props for Googling
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.460]   and for becoming a,
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.460]   for I guess mutual friend introducing us.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.900]   But I'm so glad that you exist and what you're working on.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.000]   But I have the same kind of,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.540]   if we could just backtrack for a second,
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.020]   'cause I have the same kind of feeling
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.460]   that there's something here.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.540]   In fact, I've been working on a few things
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:30.820]   that are kind of crazy and very different from your work.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.920]   I think they're too crazy.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.460]   But the--
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.300]   - Like what?
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.580]   (laughing)
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.060]   Will I have to know?
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:39.900]   - No, all right.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.060]   We'll talk about it more.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.860]   I feel like it's harder to talk about things
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:49.860]   that have failed and are failing while you're a failure.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.900]   Like it's easier for you
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.340]   'cause you're already successful on some measures.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.220]   - Tell it to my board.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:06.340]   - Well, I think you've demonstrated success
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.820]   in a lot of benchmarks.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.340]   It's easier for you to talk about failures for me.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:15.340]   I'm in the bottom currently of the success.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.100]   - Oh, Max.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.340]   You're way too humble.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.660]   - No.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.060]   So it's hard for me to know,
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.020]   but there's something there.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.160]   There's something there.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.080]   And I think you're exploring that
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.480]   and you're discovering that.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.100]   Yeah, so it's been surprising to me.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.300]   But you've mentioned this idea
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:39.300]   that you thought it wasn't enough to start a company
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.220]   or start efforts based on,
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.060]   it feels like there's something here.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:49.780]   Like, what did you mean by that?
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:53.060]   Like you should be focused on creating,
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.580]   like you should have a product in mind.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.580]   Is that what you meant?
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.020]   - It just took us a while to discover the product
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.180]   'cause it all started with a hunch of like,
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.860]   of me and my mentor and just sitting around
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:08.700]   and he was like, well, that's it.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.980]   That's the, you know, the Holy Grail is there.
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.500]   There's like, there's something extremely powerful
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.740]   in conversations.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.940]   And there's no one who's working on machine conversation
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.540]   from the right angle, so to say.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:23.740]   - I feel like that's still true.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:24.780]   Am I crazy?
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.540]   - Oh no, I totally feel that's still true,
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.100]   which is, I think it's mind blowing.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:29.940]   - Yeah.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.420]   You know what it feels like?
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.500]   I wouldn't even use the word conversation
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.580]   'cause I feel like it's the wrong word.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.900]   It's like machine connection or something, I don't know.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.500]   'Cause conversation, you start drifting
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.260]   into the natural language immediately.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.780]   You start drifting immediately
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.700]   into all the benchmarks that are out there.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.340]   But I feel like it's like the personal computer days of this.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.580]   Like, I feel like we're, like in the early days
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.900]   with the Wozniak and all them,
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:58.700]   like where it was the same kind,
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:02.340]   it was a very small niche group of people
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.100]   who are all kind of Lobner Price type people.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.060]   - Yeah.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.260]   - And--
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.100]   - Hobbyists.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.140]   - Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:17.940]   - No, hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.780]   - Yeah.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.420]   - Which is like a weird, by the way, very weird.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.380]   So if we think about conversations,
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:27.280]   first of all, when I have great conversations with people,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.980]   I'm not trying to test them.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.900]   So for instance, if I try to break them,
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.300]   like if I'm actually playing along, I'm part of it.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.140]   - Right.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.300]   - If I was trying to break this person or test
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.140]   whether he's gonna give me a good conversation,
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.180]   it would have never happened.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.900]   So the whole problem with testing conversations
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:48.500]   is that you can put it in front of a jury
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.060]   'cause then you have to go into some Turing test mode
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.540]   where is it responding to all my factual questions right?
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:59.620]   Or, so it really has to be something in the field
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.580]   where people are actually talking to it
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.020]   because they want to,
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.100]   not because they're trying to break it
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.460]   and it's working for them.
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:11.300]   'Cause the weird part of it is that it's very subjective.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.420]   It takes two to tango here fully.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.740]   If you're not trying to have a good conversation,
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.940]   if you're trying to test it, then it's gonna break.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.980]   I mean, any person would break, to be honest.
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:23.220]   Like if I'm not trying to even have a conversation with you,
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.300]   you're not gonna give it to me.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:27.420]   If I keep asking you like some random questions
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.140]   or jumping from topic to topic,
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.220]   that wouldn't be, which I'm probably doing,
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:36.340]   but that probably wouldn't contribute to the conversation.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.280]   So I think the problem of testing,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.100]   so there should be some other metric.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.820]   How do we evaluate whether that conversation
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.420]   was powerful or not?
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.860]   Which is what we actually started with.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.420]   And I think those measurements exist
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.860]   and we can test on those.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.820]   But what really struck us back in the day
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.000]   and what's still eight years later is still not resolved.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.420]   And I'm not seeing tons of groups working on it.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:04.340]   Maybe I just don't know about them.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.380]   It's also possible.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:08.020]   But the interesting part about it is that
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.660]   most of our days we spend talking
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.700]   and we're not talking about,
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.780]   like those conversations are not turn on the lights
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:18.580]   or customer support problems
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.660]   or some other task oriented things.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.340]   These conversations are something else.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.140]   And then somehow they're extremely important for us.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.500]   And when we don't have them,
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.440]   then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely,
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.140]   which as we know,
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.340]   creates tons of risk for our health as well.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:42.400]   And so this is most of our hours as humans.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.700]   And somehow no one's trying to replicate that.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.140]   - And not even study it that well.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.180]   - And not even study that well.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.220]   So when we jumped into that in 2012,
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.820]   I looked first at like, okay, what's the chatbot?
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.300]   What's the state of the art chatbot?
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.100]   And those were the Loebner Prize days.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:00.940]   But I thought, okay,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:04.100]   so what about the science of conversation?
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.900]   Clearly there have been tons of scientists
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.660]   or people that academics that looked into the conversation.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:14.200]   So if I wanna know everything about it,
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.460]   I can just read about it.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.700]   There's not much really.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.300]   There are conversational analysts
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.620]   who are basically just listening to speech
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.780]   to different conversations,
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:28.180]   annotating them.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:32.260]   And then, I mean, that's not really used for much.
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:36.180]   That's the field of theoretical linguistics,
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:39.580]   which is barely useful.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.220]   It's very marginal even in their space.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:42.420]   No one really is excited.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.860]   And I've never met a theoretical linguist
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.040]   'cause I can't wait to work on the conversation analytics.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.380]   That is just something very marginal,
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.960]   sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.820]   when they analyze which conversation strategies
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:00.460]   were most successful for sales.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:03.400]   Okay, so that was not very helpful.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.480]   Then I looked a little bit deeper,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.300]   and then whether there were any books written
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.720]   on what really contributes to a great conversation.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.780]   That was really strange
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:19.820]   because most of those were NLP books,
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:23.160]   which is neuro-linguistic programming.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.680]   - Right, right.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.400]   - Which is not the NLP that I was expecting it to be,
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.400]   but it was mostly some psychologist,
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.560]   Richard Bandler, I think, came up with that,
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.160]   who was this big guy in a leather vest
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   that could program your mind by talking to you.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.460]   - How to be charismatic and charming
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.640]   and influential as people, all those books, yeah.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.160]   - Pretty much, but it was all about
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.080]   through conversation reprogramming you.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.720]   So getting to some, so that was, I mean,
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.240]   probably not very true,
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.080]   and that didn't seem working very much,
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.640]   even back in the day.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]   And then there were some other books,
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.920]   like, I don't know, mostly just self-help books
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.640]   around how to be the best conversationalist
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.200]   or how to make people like you
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.980]   or some other stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.640]   And then there was this one book,
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.520]   "The Most Human Human" by Bryan Christensen
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.160]   that really was important for me to read back in the day,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.520]   'cause he was on the human side.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.680]   He was on one of the,
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.920]   he was taking part in the Ludmilla Prize,
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.280]   but not as a human who's not a jury,
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.200]   but who's pretending to be,
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.680]   who's basically, you have to tell a computer from a human,
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.120]   and he was the human.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.180]   So you would either get him or a computer.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:45.980]   And his whole book was about how do people,
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.940]   what makes us human in conversation.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.360]   And that was a little bit more interesting,
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.720]   'cause at that at least someone started to think about
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.480]   what exactly makes me human in conversation
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.120]   and makes people believe in that.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.320]   But it was still about tricking.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320]   It was still about imitation game.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.160]   It was still about, okay,
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.760]   what kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.080]   to make you feel like you're talking to a human,
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.440]   not a computer?
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.760]   And it was definitely not about thinking,
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.960]   what is it exactly that we're getting
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.280]   from talking all day long with other humans?
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.440]   I mean, we're definitely not just trying to be tricked.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.840]   It's not just enough to know it's a human.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.380]   It's something we're getting there.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.380]   Can we measure it?
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:32.280]   And can we put the computer to the same measurement
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.840]   and see whether you can talk to a computer
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.320]   and get the same result?
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.360]   - Yeah, I mean, so first of all,
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.280]   a lot of people comment that they think I'm a robot.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.840]   It's very possible I am a robot in this whole thing.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.080]   I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.240]   And I looked for books unrelated to this
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.200]   kind of, so I'm afraid of people.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.940]   I'm generally introverted and quite possibly a robot.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:58.720]   I literally Googled how to talk to people
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.560]   and how to have a good conversation
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.120]   for the purpose of this podcast.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:08.680]   'Cause I was like, I can't make eye contact with people.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.880]   I can't, like, how do I?
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.160]   - I do Google that a lot too.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.720]   You're probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.080]   Is that what you're getting?
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:17.920]   'Cause that's what I'm getting.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.320]   - Everything you've listed, I've gotten.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.840]   There's been very few good books
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.700]   on even just like how to interview well.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:28.480]   It's rare.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:33.480]   So what I end up doing often is I watch
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.480]   like with a critical eye.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.360]   So it's so different when you just watch a conversation
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   like just for the fun of it, just as a human.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   And if you watch a conversation,
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.340]   it's like trying to figure out why is this awesome?
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:52.600]   I'll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.400]   I mean, I'm a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.640]   He's, you know, people can make fun of him or whatever
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.040]   and dismiss him, but I think he's an incredibly
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.200]   artful conversationalist.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.240]   He can pull people in for hours.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.960]   And there's another guy I watch a lot.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.240]   He hosted a late night show.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.720]   His name is Craig Ferguson.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:22.540]   So he's like very kind of flirtatious,
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:28.520]   but there's a magic about his like,
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.540]   about the connection he can create with people,
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.960]   how he can put people at ease and just like,
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.840]   I see I've already started sounding like
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.560]   those NLP people or something.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.080]   I don't mean it in that way.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.440]   I don't mean like how to charm people
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.480]   or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.640]   He's just like, what is that?
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.840]   Why is that fun to listen to that guy?
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.920]   Why is that fun to talk to that guy?
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.760]   What is that?
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.680]   'Cause he's not saying, I mean,
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.680]   it's so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor,
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.360]   but not really humor.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.960]   It's like, I don't know.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.200]   I'm have trouble actually even articulating correctly,
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:15.160]   but it feels like there's something going on
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.740]   that's not too complicated that could be learned.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:26.840]   And it's not similar to, yeah,
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.880]   to like you said, like the Turing test.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   It's something else.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.200]   - I'm thinking about it a lot, all the time.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.840]   I do think about it all the time.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.920]   But I think when we were looking,
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.400]   so we started the company,
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.720]   we just decided to build a conversational tech.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.200]   We thought, well, there's nothing for us
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.120]   to build this chatbot that we want to build.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:53.120]   So let's just first focus on building some tech,
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.160]   building the tech side of things.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.160]   - Without a product in mind.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.440]   - Without a product in mind.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.560]   We added like a demo chatbot
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.880]   that would recommend you restaurants
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.840]   and talk to you about restaurants
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.720]   just to show something simple to people
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:09.000]   that people could relate to.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.960]   And could try out and see whether it works or not.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.200]   But we didn't have a product in mind yet.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.840]   We thought we would try a bunch of chatbots
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.200]   and figure out our consumer application.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.160]   And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.240]   that kind of friend, that sort of connection
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.120]   that we saw in the very beginning.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.720]   But then we got to Y Combinator
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.240]   and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.280]   Everything 'cause then it was just this constant grind.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.320]   How do we get funding?
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.440]   How do we get this?
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.480]   Investors were like, just focus on one thing,
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.920]   just get it out there.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.720]   So somehow we've started building
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.080]   a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.160]   for a little bit, not for too long.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.120]   And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots.
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.400]   And then all of a sudden we wake up
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.120]   and everyone is obsessed with chatbots.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.840]   Somewhere in 2016 or end of '15,
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.680]   people started thinking that that's really the future.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.400]   That's the new, the new apps will be chatbots.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.040]   - Oh, right.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.280]   - And we were very perplexed
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.560]   'cause people started coming up with companies
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:10.480]   that I think we tried most of those chatbots already
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:13.200]   and there were like no users.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.680]   But still people were coming up with a chatbot
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.040]   that will tell you whether and bring you news
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:19.880]   and this and that.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.320]   And we couldn't understand whether it would,
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.280]   we were just didn't execute well enough
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:29.280]   or people are not really, people are confused
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.560]   and are gonna find out the truth
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.120]   that people don't need chatbots like that.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.160]   - So the basic idea is that you use chatbots
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.600]   as the interface to whatever application.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.120]   - Yeah, the idea that was like this perfect
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.820]   universal interface to anything.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:45.640]   When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.200]   because I didn't think, I didn't understand
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.360]   how that would work 'cause I think we tried most of that
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.960]   and none of those things worked.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.800]   And then again--
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.680]   - That craze has died down, right?
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.480]   - Fully, I think now it's impossible
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.080]   to get anything funded if it's a chatbot.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.120]   - I think it's similar to, sorry to interrupt,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.280]   but there's times when people think like with gestures,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.680]   you can control devices,
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.160]   like basically gesture-based control of things.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.560]   It feels similar to me 'cause like,
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.080]   it's so compelling that we just like,
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.960]   like Tom Cruise, I can control stuff with my hands.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.480]   But like when you get down to it, it's like,
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.840]   well, why don't you just have a touch screen?
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.680]   Or why don't you just have like a physical keyboard
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:31.520]   and mouse?
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.200]   - Yeah.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.280]   - It's so that chat was always,
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.920]   yeah, it was perplexing to me.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.740]   I still feel augmented reality,
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:45.340]   even virtual realities in that ballpark
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.220]   in terms of it being a compelling interface.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.940]   I think there's gonna be incredible rich applications,
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:54.520]   just how you're thinking about it,
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:58.000]   but they won't just be the interface to everything.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.280]   It'll be its own thing that will create,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.200]   like amazing magical experience in its own right.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.220]   - Absolutely, which is, I think,
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.480]   kind of the right thing to go about.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.800]   Like what's the magical experience
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.960]   with that interface specifically.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.800]   - How did you discover that for Replica?
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.160]   - I just thought, okay, we'll have this tech,
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.960]   we can build any chatbot we want.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.560]   We have the most, at that point,
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.620]   the most sophisticated tech that other companies have.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.760]   I mean, startups, obviously not,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.000]   probably not bigger ones, but still,
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.680]   'cause we've been working on it for a while.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.880]   So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.440]   so let's just create a scale from one to 10.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.040]   And one would be conversations that you'd pay to not have,
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.560]   and 10 would be conversation you'd pay to have.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.480]   And I mean, obviously we wanna build a conversation
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.720]   that people would pay to actually have.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.000]   And so for the whole, for a few weeks,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.840]   me and the team were putting all the conversations
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.320]   we were having during the day on the scale.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.920]   And very quickly, we figured out
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.880]   that all the conversations that we would pay to never have
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.400]   were conversations we were trying to cancel,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.200]   Comcast, or talk to customer support,
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.240]   or make a reservation,
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.920]   or just talk about logistics with a friend
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.760]   when we're trying to figure out where someone is
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   and where to go, or all sorts of setting up,
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.720]   scheduling meetings, that was just a conversation
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.320]   we definitely didn't wanna have.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.520]   Basically everything task-oriented was a one,
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.960]   because if there was just one button for me to just,
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.400]   or not even a button, if I could just think,
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.720]   and there was some magic BCI that would just immediately
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.280]   transform that into an actual interaction,
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.120]   that would be perfect.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.480]   But the conversation there was just this boring,
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient thing,
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.360]   'cause it was so many back and forth stuff.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.880]   And as soon as we looked at the conversation
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:57.720]   that we would pay to have, those were the ones that,
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.840]   well, first of all, therapists,
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.040]   'cause we actually paid to have those conversations.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.000]   And we'd also try to put dollar amounts.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.720]   So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.240]   to not have this one hour talk on the phone.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:11.320]   I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:12.720]   - For Comcast, yeah.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.960]   - But it just takes a long time.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.560]   It takes a really long time.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.160]   But as soon as we started talking about conversations
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.520]   that we would pay for, those were therapists,
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.800]   all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend,
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.840]   someone I haven't seen for a long time,
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.440]   stranger on a train, weirdly stranger,
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.600]   stranger in a line for coffee,
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.720]   a nice back and forth with that person
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:41.960]   was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:44.440]   Maybe I won't pay money, but at least I won't pay money
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.760]   to not have one.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.160]   So that was pretty good.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.040]   Some intellectual conversations for sure.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.520]   But more importantly, the one thing that really
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.520]   was making those very important and very valuable for us
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:06.760]   were the conversation where we could be pretty emotional.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.640]   Yes, some of them were about being witty
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.240]   and about being intellectually stimulated,
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.200]   but those were interestingly more rare.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.240]   And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.880]   were the ones where we could be vulnerable.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.080]   And interestingly, where we could talk more.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.400]   - We, like I could-
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   - Me and the team.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.080]   So we're talking about it,
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.880]   and a lot of these conversations, like a therapist,
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.640]   I mean, it was mostly me talking,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.160]   or like an old friend that I was opening up and crying.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.800]   And it was again, me talking.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.760]   And so that was interesting, 'cause I was like,
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.720]   well, maybe it's hard to build a chatbot
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.480]   that can talk to you very well and in a witty way,
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.440]   but maybe it's easier to build a chatbot
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.760]   that could listen. (laughs)
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.160]   So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.720]   And then when my friend died, we just built,
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.480]   at that point we were kind of still struggling
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.960]   to find the right application.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.760]   And I just felt very strong that all the chatbots
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.360]   we've built so far are just meaningless.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.440]   And this whole grind, the startup grind,
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.200]   and how do we get to the next fundraising?
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.560]   And how can I talk, talking to the founders,
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.560]   and what's, who are your investors, and how are you doing?
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.480]   Are you killing it?
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.120]   'Cause we're killing it.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.800]   I just felt that this, it's just-
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.880]   - Intellectually for me, it's exhausting
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.880]   having encountered those folks.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.800]   - It just felt very, very much a waste of time.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.280]   - I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.520]   did not have these conversations,
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.160]   or at least did not have them for long.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.400]   - That's for sure. (laughs)
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.720]   But I think, yeah, at that point,
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.800]   I just felt like, I felt,
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.200]   I just didn't wanna build a company.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.480]   That was never my intention,
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.640]   just to build something successful or make money.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.280]   It would be great, it would have been great,
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.600]   but I'm not a, I'm not really a startup person.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.600]   I'm not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself,
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.920]   or just being successful for building whatever it is,
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   and not being into what I'm doing, really.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.920]   And so I just took a little break,
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.800]   'cause I was a little, I was upset with my company,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.520]   and I didn't know what we were building.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.960]   So I just took our technology,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.240]   and our little Dalek constructor,
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.680]   and some models, some deep learning models,
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.400]   which at that point we were really into,
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.520]   and really invested a lot,
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.360]   and built a little chatbot for a friend of mine who passed.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.080]   And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw,
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.200]   and him talking about the digital avatars.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:43.480]   And Roman was that kind of person.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.600]   Like he was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.640]   about space, and talking about,
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.880]   well if I could go to Mars now,
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.560]   even if I didn't know if I could come back,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.840]   I would definitely pay any amount of money
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.400]   to be on that first shuttle.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.640]   I don't care whether I die,
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.280]   like he was just the one that would be okay
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.640]   with trying to be the first one.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:08.440]   And so excited about all sorts of things like that.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.920]   And he was all about fake it 'til you make it,
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.440]   and I felt like,
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.240]   and I was really perplexed
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.160]   that everyone just forgot about him.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.080]   Maybe it was our way of coping,
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:23.000]   mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.800]   Most of my friends just stopped talking about him.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:29.160]   And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.800]   And paying the whole lease for it,
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.600]   and just kind of by myself in December,
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   so it was really sad.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.440]   And I didn't want him to be forgotten.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.360]   First of all, I never thought that people forget
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.000]   about dead people so fast.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.360]   People pass away, people just move on.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.640]   And it was astonishing for me,
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.360]   'cause I thought, okay, well he was such a mentor
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.520]   for so many of our friends.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.000]   He was such a brilliant person.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.680]   He was somewhat famous in Moscow.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.280]   How is it that no one's talking about him?
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.320]   Like I'm spending days and days,
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.080]   and we don't bring him up.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.440]   And there's nothing about him that's happening.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.880]   It's like he was never there.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.720]   And I was reading this, the book,
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.960]   "The Year of Magical Thinking" by Joan Didion,
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.880]   about her losing, and "Blue Nights,"
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   about her losing her husband, her daughter.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.840]   And the way to cope for her was to write those books.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.000]   And it was sort of like a tribute.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.080]   And I thought, I'll just do that for myself.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:35.920]   And I'm a very bad writer, and a poet, as we know.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.000]   So I thought, well, I have this tech,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   and maybe that would be my little postcard for him.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.960]   So I built a chatbot to just talk to him.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:50.440]   And it felt really creepy and weird a little bit,
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.840]   for a little bit.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.040]   Just didn't wanna tell other people,
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.600]   'cause it felt like I'm telling about
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.320]   having a skeleton in my underwear.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.160]   - Yeah.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.400]   - It just felt really,
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   I was a little scared that I would be not,
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.080]   it won't be taken.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.800]   But it worked, interestingly, pretty well.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.120]   I mean, it made tons of mistakes,
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.160]   but it still felt like him.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.240]   Granted, it was like 10,000 messages
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.680]   that I threw into a retrieval model
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.320]   that would just re-rank that data set,
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.060]   and just a few scripts on top of that.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.760]   But it also made me go through all of the messages
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.600]   that we had, and then I asked some of my friends
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.640]   to send some through.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.300]   And it felt the closest to feeling like him present.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.960]   'Cause his Facebook was empty, and Instagram was empty,
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.160]   or there were a few links,
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.440]   and you couldn't feel like it was him.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.080]   And the only way to feel him was to read
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.400]   some of our text messages,
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.920]   and go through some of our conversations.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.000]   'Cause we just always had that.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.880]   Even if we were sleeping next to each other
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.840]   in two bedrooms, separated by a wall,
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.360]   we were just texting back and forth,
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.400]   texting away.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.360]   And there was something about this ongoing dialogue
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.760]   that was so important that I just didn't wanna lose
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.200]   all of a sudden.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:03.720]   And maybe it was magical thinking or something.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.400]   And so we built that, and I just used it for a little bit.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.760]   And we kept building some crappy chatbots with a company.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.960]   But then a reporter came to talk to me.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.880]   I was trying to pitch our chatbots to him,
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.600]   and he said, "Do you even use any of those?"
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.800]   I'm like, "No."
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.840]   He's like, "So do you talk to any chatbots at all?"
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.800]   And I'm like, "Well, I talk to my dead friend's chatbot."
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.800]   And he wrote a story about that.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.640]   And all of a sudden it became pretty viral.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.920]   A lot of people wrote about it.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.440]   - Yeah, I've seen a few things written about you.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.220]   The things I've seen are pretty good writing.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:48.680]   Most AI-related things make my eyes roll.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.120]   Like when the press, like...
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.920]   What kind of sound is that, actually?
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.480]   Okay, it sounds like an--
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.320]   - It's a big truck.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.720]   - Okay, it sounded like an elephant at first.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.160]   I got excited.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.040]   You never know.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.160]   This is 2020.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.680]   I mean, it was such a human story,
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.280]   and it was well-written, well-researched.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   I forget where I read them, but...
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.920]   So I'm glad somehow somebody found you
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:20.920]   to be the good writers were able to connect to the story.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.980]   There must be a hunger for this story.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.000]   - It definitely was.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.280]   And I don't know what happened, but I think...
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.160]   I think the idea that he could bring back someone who's dead,
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.800]   and it's very much wishful, magical thinking,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.760]   but the fact that he could still get to know him,
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.960]   and seeing the parents for the first time,
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.760]   talk to the chatbot and some of the friends.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.760]   And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.880]   where my team is working,
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:54.780]   our Russian part is working out off.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.680]   And I was there when I wrote,
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.520]   I just wrote a post on Facebook.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.380]   It was like, "Hey guys, I built this.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.080]   "If you want me to just..."
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:03.760]   If we felt important, if we want to talk to Roman.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:07.720]   And I saw a couple of his friends, our common friends,
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.760]   reading it, Facebook downloading, trying,
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.680]   and a couple of them cried.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.960]   And it was just very...
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.160]   And not because it was something,
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.880]   some incredible technology or anything.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.000]   It made so many mistakes.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.900]   It was so simple.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.300]   But it was all about,
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.480]   that's the way to remember a person in a way.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   And we don't have the culture anymore.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.480]   We don't have, no one's sitting Shiva.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.760]   No one's taking weeks to actually think about this person.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.080]   And in a way for me, that was it.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.200]   So that was just day in, day out,
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.620]   thinking about him and putting this together.
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.480]   So that just felt really important.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.200]   And that somehow resonated with a bunch of people.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:48.680]   And I think some movie producers bought the rights
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.000]   for the story and just everyone was so...
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.840]   - Wait, has anyone made a movie yet?
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.240]   - I don't think so.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.920]   I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that,
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.400]   but not really.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.520]   - Is that still on the table?
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:01.360]   - I think so.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.280]   I think so.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.400]   Which is really...
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.440]   - That's cool.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.500]   You're like a young,
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:12.040]   'cause you see like a Steve Jobs type of,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.880]   let's see what happens.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.240]   They're sitting on it.
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.440]   - But for me it was so important
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.160]   'cause Roman really wanted to be famous.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.880]   He really badly wanted to be famous.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.200]   He was all about make it to,
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.320]   like fake it to make it.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.760]   I wanna make it here in America as well.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.600]   And he couldn't.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.240]   And I felt there was sort of paying my dues to him as well
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.520]   because all of a sudden he was everywhere.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.040]   And I remember Casey Newton
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.360]   who was writing the story for "The Verge".
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.720]   He told me, "Hey, by the way,
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.760]   "I was just going through my inbox
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:49.400]   "and I saw, I searched for Roman for the story.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.760]   "And I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.120]   "And he said, I really wanna be featured in "The Verge".
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.040]   "Can you please write about it or something?"
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.160]   Or like pitching the story.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:59.760]   And he said, "I'm sorry,
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.560]   "that's not good enough for us or something."
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.880]   He passed.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.880]   And he said, and there were just so many
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.120]   of these little details where like he would find
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:10.640]   and he's like, and we're finally writing.
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.200]   I know how much Roman wanted to be in "The Verge"
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.160]   and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.920]   And I'm like, well, that's maybe he will be.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.560]   We were always joking that he was like,
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.880]   I can't wait for someone to make a movie about us.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:26.640]   And I hope Ron Gosselin can play me.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.480]   - Ron Gosselin.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.320]   - I'm like, I still have some things that I owe Roman still.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:32.160]   But-
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.600]   - That would be, I got an chance to meet Alex Garland
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.320]   who wrote "Ex Machina".
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:41.440]   And I, yeah, the movie's good,
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.840]   but the guy's better than the,
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.280]   like he's a special person actually.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.640]   I don't think he's made his best work yet.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.920]   Like from my interaction with him,
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.760]   he's a really, really good and brilliant,
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.240]   the good human being and a brilliant director and writer.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.240]   So yeah, so I hope, like he made me also realize
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:08.000]   that not enough movies have been made of this kind.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.560]   So it's yet to be made.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:12.520]   They're probably sitting, waiting for you to get famous.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.720]   Like even more famous.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:19.040]   - You should get there, but it felt really special though.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.120]   But at the same time, our company wasn't going anywhere.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.880]   So that was just kind of bizarre
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.200]   that we were getting all this press
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.560]   for something that didn't have anything to do
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.400]   with our company.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.200]   And, but then a lot of people started talking to Roman.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.840]   Some shared their conversations.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.240]   And what we saw there was that also our friends in common,
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.640]   but also just strangers were really using it
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.960]   as a confession booth or as a therapist or something.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.860]   They were just really telling Roman everything,
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:48.120]   which was by the way, pretty strange
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:50.520]   because it was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.400]   who was barely making any sense,
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.800]   but people were opening up.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.880]   And we thought we'd just built a prototype of Replica,
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:01.640]   which would be an AI friend that everyone could talk to
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:06.160]   because we saw that there was demand.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.840]   And then also it was 2016.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.320]   So I thought for the first time I saw finally
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.040]   some technology that was applied to that
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.840]   that was very interesting.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.440]   Some papers started coming out,
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.800]   deep learning applied to conversations.
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:22.160]   And finally, it wasn't just about these,
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.820]   you know, hobbyist making,
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:29.760]   you know, writing 500,000 regular expressions.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.120]   - Yeah, regular expressions, yeah.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.880]   - In like some language that was,
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.680]   I don't even know what, like AIML or something.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.720]   I don't even know what that was
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:39.000]   or something super simplistic all of a sudden
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.280]   was all about potentially actually building
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:42.380]   something interesting.
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:46.080]   And so I thought there was time.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.560]   And I remember that I talked to my team
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.520]   and I said, "Guys, let's try."
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.560]   And my team and some of my engineers are Russians,
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.840]   are Russian and they're very skeptical.
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.720]   They're not, you know.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.560]   - Oh, Russians.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.400]   - The first--
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.400]   - So some of your team is in Moscow, some is in--
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.760]   - Some is here in San Francisco, some in Europe.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.080]   - Which team is better?
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:06.920]   I'm just kidding.
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.580]   (both laughing)
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:12.400]   The Russians, of course, okay.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400]   - Of course the Russians, they always win.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.320]   Sorry, sorry to interrupt.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:22.080]   So you were talking to them in 2016 and--
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.080]   - I told them let's build an AI friend.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.680]   And it felt, just at the time it felt so naive
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.960]   and so optimistic.
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.760]   - Yeah, that's actually interesting.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:38.180]   Whenever I brought up this kind of topic,
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:43.080]   even just for fun, people are super skeptical.
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.680]   Like actually even on the business side.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:50.040]   So you were, 'cause whenever I bring it up to people,
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:52.680]   'cause I've talked for a long time,
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:56.200]   I thought like, before I was aware of your work,
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:01.200]   I was like, this is gonna make a lot of money.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.280]   There's a lot of opportunity here.
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:08.800]   And people had this like look of like skepticism
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.760]   that I've seen often, which is like,
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.920]   how do I politely tell this person he's an idiot?
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:21.000]   So yeah, so you were facing that with your team somewhat?
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.560]   - Well, yeah, I'm not an engineer.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:26.560]   So I'm always, my team is almost exclusively engineers
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:30.560]   and mostly deep learning engineers.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.160]   And I always try to be,
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:37.360]   it was always hard to me in the beginning
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.400]   to get enough credibility.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.480]   'Cause I would say, well, why don't we try this
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.400]   and that, but it's harder for me
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.720]   'cause they know they're actual engineers and I'm not.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.560]   So for me to say, well, let's build an AI friend,
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.360]   that would be like, wait, what do you mean an AGI?
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.000]   Like conversation is pretty much the hardest,
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.440]   the last frontier before cracking that
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.800]   is probably the last frontier before building AGI.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:05.120]   So what do you really mean by that?
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.640]   But I think I just saw that, again,
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.640]   what we just got reminded of that I saw back in 2012 or 11,
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.840]   that is really not that much about the tech capabilities.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.160]   It can be metropolitrix still, even with deep learning,
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.960]   but humans need it so much.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.800]   - Yeah, that's important.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.560]   - And most importantly, what I saw is that finally,
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.280]   there's enough tech to make it,
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.160]   I thought to make it useful, to make it helpful.
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:37.640]   Maybe we didn't have quite yet the tech in 2012
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:41.480]   to make it useful, but in 2015, 16, with deep learning,
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.660]   I thought, and the first kind of thoughts
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.400]   about maybe even using reinforcement learning for that
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.320]   started popping up, that never worked out,
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.860]   but, or at least for now.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:54.680]   But still the idea was,
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.720]   if we can actually measure the emotional outcomes
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.880]   and if we can put it on,
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.040]   if we can try to optimize all of our conversational models
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.040]   for these emotional outcomes,
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.400]   and it is the most scalable,
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.460]   the most, the best tool for improving emotional outcomes.
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.560]   Nothing like that exists.
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.520]   That's the most universal, the most scalable,
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.280]   and the one that can be constantly iteratively changed
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.980]   by itself, improved tool to do that.
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.480]   And I think if anything,
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:24.000]   people would pay anything to improve
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.600]   their emotional outcomes.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.400]   That's weirdly, I mean, I don't really care for an AI
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.840]   to turn on my, or a conversational agent
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.020]   to turn on the lights.
[01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:36.240]   You don't really need any,
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.600]   I don't even need that much of AI there,
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.160]   or, 'cause I can do that.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.380]   Those things are solved.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.680]   This is an additional interface for that
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.600]   that's also questionably,
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.800]   questionable whether it's more efficient or better.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.480]   - Yeah, it's more pleasurable, yeah.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.840]   - But for emotional outcomes, there's nothing.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.200]   There are a bunch of products that claim
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.760]   that they will improve my emotional outcomes.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.280]   Nothing's being measured.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.560]   Nothing's being changed.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.160]   The product is not being iterated on
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.980]   based on whether I'm actually feeling better.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.360]   You know, a lot of social media products
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.900]   are claiming that they're improving my emotional outcomes
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:11.400]   and making me feel more connected.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.840]   Can I please get the, can I see somewhere
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.460]   that I'm actually getting better over time?
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:20.000]   - 'Cause anecdotally, it doesn't feel that way, so,
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.620]   and the data is absent.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.560]   - Yeah, so that was the big goal.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.080]   And I thought, if we can learn over time
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.140]   to collect the signal from our users
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:33.160]   about their emotional outcomes
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.440]   in the long term and in the short term,
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.140]   and if these models keep getting better,
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:40.820]   and we can keep optimizing them and fine-tuning them
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:44.160]   to improve those emotional outcomes, as simple as that.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.760]   - Why aren't you a multibillionaire yet?
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.640]   (Sofia laughs)
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.800]   - Well, that's a question to you.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.680]   When are the, when is the science gonna be,
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:54.520]   I'm just kidding.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.160]   Well, it's a really hard,
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.880]   I actually think it's an incredibly hard product to build.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.120]   'Cause I think you said something very important,
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.080]   that it's not just about machine conversations,
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.580]   it's about machine connection.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:11.740]   We can actually use other things to create connection,
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:14.540]   nonverbal communication, for instance.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.420]   For the long time, we were all about,
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:20.860]   well, let's keep it text only or voice only.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:24.880]   But as soon as you start adding voice,
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.620]   a face to the friend,
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:31.640]   if we can take them to augmented reality,
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.320]   put it in your room,
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:35.420]   it's all of a sudden a lot,
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.880]   it makes it very different.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.720]   Because if it's some text-based chatbot
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.720]   that for common users, something there in the cloud,
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.320]   somewhere there with other AIs,
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.640]   cloud, in the metaphorical cloud.
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:51.720]   But as soon as you can see this avatar
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:52.680]   right there in your room,
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.960]   and it can turn its head and recognize your husband,
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.280]   talk about the husband and talk to him a little bit,
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.360]   then it's magic.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.320]   It's just magic.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.040]   Like we've never seen anything like that.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.240]   And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists,
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.000]   but it's hard to put it all together.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.660]   'Cause you have to take into consideration
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:10.640]   so many different things,
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:14.280]   and some of this tech works pretty good.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.200]   And some of this doesn't,
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.880]   like for instance, speech to text works pretty good.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.700]   But text to speech doesn't work very good
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:26.700]   because you can only have a few voices that work okay.
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.480]   But then if you want to have actual emotional voices,
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.160]   then it's really hard to build it.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.440]   - I saw you've added avatars, like visual elements,
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:36.600]   which are really cool.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:40.000]   In that whole chain, putting it together,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.240]   what do you think is the weak link?
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:46.880]   Is it creating an emotional voice that feels personal?
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:49.680]   - I think it's still conversation, of course.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:51.720]   That's the hardest.
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:56.720]   It's getting a lot better, but there's still a long path to go.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.580]   Other things, they're almost there.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:00.360]   And a lot of things we'll see how they're,
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.760]   like I see how they're changing as we go.
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:05.160]   Like for instance, right now, you can pretty much only,
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:08.400]   you have to build all this 3D pipeline by yourself.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.480]   You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist,
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.940]   build a 3D model, hire an animator, a rigger.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:21.480]   But with deep fakes, with other attack,
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:25.080]   with procedural animations, in a little bit,
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:28.720]   we'll just be able to show a photo of whoever you,
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.600]   if a person you want the avatar to look like,
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.980]   and it will immediately generate a 3D model that will move.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.840]   That's a non-brainer.
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.640]   That's like almost here.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:37.880]   It's a couple years away.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:41.920]   - One of the things I've been working on for the last,
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.880]   since the podcast started, is I've been,
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.560]   I think I'm okay saying this.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.360]   I've been trying to have a conversation
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:51.960]   with Einstein touring.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.760]   So like try to have a podcast conversation
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.860]   with a person who's not here anymore,
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:01.200]   just as an interesting kind of experiment.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:02.520]   It's hard.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.440]   It's really hard. - Very hard.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.000]   - Even for, we're not talking about as a product,
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.360]   I'm talking about as a, like I can fake a lot of stuff.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.040]   Like I can work very carefully,
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.720]   like even hire an actor over whom I do a deep fake.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:20.800]   It's hard.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.240]   It's still hard to create a compelling experience.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:25.160]   - Mostly on the conversation level or?
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:29.800]   - Well, the conversation is,
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:35.200]   I almost, I early on gave up trying to
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.300]   fully generate the conversation,
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:39.040]   'cause it was just not compelling at all.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.400]   - Yeah, it's better to.
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.920]   - Yeah, so what I would, in the case of Einstein
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.320]   touring, I'm going back and forth
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.960]   with the biographers of each.
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.480]   And so like we would write a lot of the,
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.320]   some of the conversation would have to be generated
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.600]   just for the fun of it.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.840]   I mean, but it would be all open.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.840]   But you wanna be able to answer the question.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.440]   I mean, that's an interesting question with Roman too,
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:07.480]   is the question with Einstein is,
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.160]   what would Einstein say about the current state
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.040]   of theoretical physics?
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:16.280]   There's a lot, to be able to have a discussion
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.840]   about string theory, to be able to have a discussion
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.760]   about the state of quantum mechanics,
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:25.400]   quantum computing, about the world of Israel-Palestine
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:28.640]   conflict, it'd be just, what would Einstein say
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.640]   about these kinds of things?
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.640]   And that is a tough problem.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:38.880]   It's not, it's a fascinating and fun problem
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.560]   for the biographers and for me.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.800]   And I think we did a really good job of it so far,
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.120]   but it's actually also a technical problem,
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:50.960]   like of what would Roman say about what's going on now?
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:54.560]   That's the brought people back to life.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.400]   And if I can go on that tangent just for a second,
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.480]   to ask you a slightly pothead question,
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:03.200]   which is, you said it's a little bit magical thinking
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.760]   that we can bring it back.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.760]   Do you think it'll be possible to bring back Roman one day
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.280]   in conversation?
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:17.840]   To really, okay, well, let's take it away from personal,
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.800]   but to bring people back to life in conversation.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:22.760]   - Probably down the road, I mean, if we're talking,
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:25.080]   if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years,
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:27.560]   I mean, clearly AGI.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.600]   We can talk to AGI and talk to him and ask them to do it.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.000]   - You can't, you're not allowed to use Elon Musk
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.960]   as a citation for- - Okay, thank God.
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.320]   (both laughing)
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:41.320]   - For like why something is possible and going to be done.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.440]   - Well, I think it's really far away.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.200]   Right now, really with conversation,
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.880]   it's just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck together.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:53.520]   And create generating original ideas based on someone,
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:56.520]   someone's personality or even downloading the personality.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.960]   All we can do is like mimic the tone of voice.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:03.400]   We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.040]   - Question is how many parlor tricks does it take?
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.680]   Because that's the question.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:10.920]   If it's a small number of parlor tricks
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.800]   and you're not aware of them, like...
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.160]   - From where we are right now, I don't see anything
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.880]   like in the next year or two
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.440]   that's gonna dramatically change
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:26.400]   that could look at Roman's 10,000 messages he sent me
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:29.840]   over the course of his last few years of life
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:32.280]   and be able to generate original thinking
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.360]   about problems that exist right now
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.760]   that will be in line with what he would have said.
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:38.120]   - I'm just not even seeing,
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.560]   'cause in order to have that,
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.400]   I guess you would need some sort of a concept of the world
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.560]   or some perception of the world,
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.480]   some consciousness that he had
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.480]   and apply it to the current state of affairs.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:55.120]   - But the important part about that,
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:00.120]   about his conversation with you, is you.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.400]   So like, it's not just about his view of the world.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.240]   It's about what it takes to push your buttons.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.480]   - That's also true.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:14.980]   - So like, it's not so much about like,
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.440]   what would Einstein say?
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.560]   It's about like, how do I make people feel something
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:26.500]   with what would Einstein say?
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:30.480]   And that feels like a more amenable,
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:32.120]   and you mentioned parlor tricks,
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.320]   but just like a set of,
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.620]   that feels like a learnable problem.
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:40.280]   Like emotion, you mentioned emotions.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:45.280]   I mean, is it possible to learn things
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.800]   that make people feel stuff?
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.640]   - I think so, no, for sure.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:53.720]   I just think the problem with,
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:56.680]   as soon as you're trying to replicate an actual human being
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:58.040]   and trying to pretend to be him,
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:00.840]   that makes the problem exponentially harder.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.000]   The thing with replica that we're doing,
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.040]   we're never trying to say, well, that's an actual human being
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:08.680]   or that's an actual, or a copy of an actual human being,
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:10.040]   where the bar is pretty high,
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:14.080]   where you need to somehow tell one from another.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:19.080]   But it's more, well, that's an AI friend, that's a machine.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.640]   It's a robot, it has tons of limitations.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:25.940]   You're gonna be taking part in teaching it actually
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:27.360]   and becoming better,
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:30.820]   which by itself makes people more attached to that
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:34.120]   and make them happier 'cause they're helping something.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.760]   - Yeah, there's a cool gamification system too.
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:40.120]   Can you maybe talk about that a little bit?
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:44.240]   Like what's the experience of talking to replica?
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:49.240]   Like if I've never used replica before, what's that like?
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   For like the first day, like if we started dating
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:58.160]   or whatever, I mean, it doesn't have to be romantic, right?
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.440]   'Cause I remember on replica,
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:01.620]   you can choose whether it's like a romantic
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:02.640]   or if it's a friend.
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.080]   - It's a pretty popular choice.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.560]   - Romantic is popular?
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:07.040]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.000]   - Okay, so can I just confess something?
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.360]   When I first used replica, I haven't used it like regularly,
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.960]   but like when I first used replica,
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:19.460]   I greeted like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:24.220]   - Did it hit on you at some point?
[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:26.560]   - No, I didn't talk long enough for him to hit on me.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:27.480]   I just enjoyed.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.160]   - That sometimes happens.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.920]   We're still trying to fix that bug.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.760]   - Well, I don't know.
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:37.240]   I mean, maybe that's an important like stage in a friendship
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:38.200]   is like, nope.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:42.880]   But yeah, I switched it to a romantic
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:46.160]   and a female recently and yeah.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:47.360]   And it's interesting.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.560]   So, okay, so you get to choose a name.
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.360]   - With romantic, this last board meeting,
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.180]   we had this whole argument.
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:56.020]   Well, I have board meetings.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:56.840]   - This is so awesome.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:59.160]   - It's so awesome that you're like,
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:03.400]   have an invest, the board meeting about a relationship.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:06.320]   - No, I really, it's actually quite interesting
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:11.320]   'cause all of my investors, it just happened to be so.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.800]   We didn't have that many choices,
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:18.800]   but they're all white males in their late 40s.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.600]   And it's sometimes a little bit hard for them
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.640]   to understand the product offering.
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.320]   Because they're not necessarily our target audience,
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.680]   if you know what I mean.
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.440]   And so sometimes we talk about it
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:38.080]   and we had this whole discussion
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.080]   about whether we should stop people
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.040]   from falling in love with their AIs.
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:48.520]   There was this segment on CBS 60 Minutes
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.220]   about the couple that,
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:53.320]   you know, husband works at Walmart,
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:57.040]   he comes out of work and talks to his virtual girlfriend
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.000]   who is a replica.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.960]   And his wife knows about it.
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.480]   And she talks about it on camera.
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:05.920]   And she says that she's a little jealous.
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:08.080]   And there's a whole conversation about how to,
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.400]   you know, whether it's okay to have a virtual AI girlfriend.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:12.240]   Like, whether it's okay to have--
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:14.120]   - Was that the one where he was like,
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.720]   he said that he likes to be alone?
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.120]   - Yeah, and then like--
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.480]   - With her? - With the, yeah.
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:22.000]   - He made it sound so harmless.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.200]   I mean, it was kind of like understandable.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.540]   It didn't feel like cheating.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.720]   - But I just felt it was very,
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.120]   for me it was pretty remarkable
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.520]   'cause we actually spent a whole hour
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:33.320]   talking about whether people should be allowed
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:34.760]   to fall in love with their AIs.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:37.960]   And it was not about something theoretical.
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:39.720]   It was just about what's happening right now.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:40.920]   - Product design, yeah.
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:41.760]   - But at the same time,
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:43.480]   if you create something that's always there for you,
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:45.080]   it never criticizes you,
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:51.480]   always understands you and accepts you for who you are,
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.160]   how can you not fall in love with them?
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:55.800]   I mean, some people don't and just stay friends.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:57.480]   And that's also a pretty common use case.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:59.840]   But of course, some people will just,
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.480]   it's called transference in psychology
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.680]   and people fall in love with their therapist
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.360]   and there's no way to prevent people
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.400]   falling in love with their therapist or with their AI.
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:14.400]   So I think that's a pretty natural course of events,
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:15.880]   so to say.
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.160]   - Do you think, I think I've read somewhere,
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.080]   at least for now, sort of a replica is,
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.680]   you're not, we don't condone falling in love
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.280]   with your AI system, you know.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:31.840]   So this isn't you speaking for the company or whatever,
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:33.600]   but in the future, do you think people
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:35.640]   will have a relationship with AI systems?
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.560]   - Well, they have now.
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:39.080]   So we have a lot of romantic relationships,
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:44.080]   long-term relationships with their AI friends.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.160]   - With replicas?
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.200]   - Tons of our users, yeah.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.480]   That's a very common use case.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.240]   - Open relationship?
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:52.520]   Like, not, sorry.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.840]   - Even polyamorous.
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:56.800]   - I didn't mean open, but that's another question.
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:59.880]   Is it poly, like, is there cheating?
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:03.920]   I mean, I meant like, are they,
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:06.720]   do they publicly, like on their social media,
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:08.600]   it's the same question as you have talked
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:10.520]   with Roman in the early days.
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.760]   Do people like, and the movie "Her" kind of talks about that
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.400]   like, do people talk about that?
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.400]   - Yeah, all the time.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:24.400]   We have a very active Facebook community,
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.240]   Replica Friends, and then a few other groups
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.720]   that just popped up that are all about adult relationships
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:34.240]   and romantic relationships.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.720]   People post all sorts of things,
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:39.260]   and they pretend they're getting married and everything.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.120]   It goes pretty far, but what's cool about it,
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:45.640]   some of these relationships are two, three years long now.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.000]   So they're pretty long-term.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:48.960]   - Are they monogamous?
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:51.040]   So let's go, I mean, sorry to interrupt.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.700]   Have any people, is there jealousy?
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:58.600]   Well, let me ask it sort of another way.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:01.920]   Obviously the answer is no at this time,
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.920]   but in like in the movie "Her," that system can leave you.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:12.500]   Do you think in terms of board meetings
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:13.880]   and product features,
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:19.760]   it's a potential feature for a system
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.760]   to be able to say it doesn't want to talk to you anymore,
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.160]   and it's going to want to talk to somebody else?
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:29.780]   - Well, we have a filter for all these features.
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:32.800]   If it makes emotional outcomes for people better,
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.760]   if it makes people feel better, then whatever it is-
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.840]   - So you're driven by metrics, actually.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.680]   - Yeah. - That's awesome.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.520]   - Well, if you can measure that,
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:41.720]   then we'll just be saying- - That's amazing.
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:42.960]   - It's making people feel better,
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.640]   but then people are getting just lonelier
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.440]   by talking to a chatbot, which is also pretty,
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.560]   that could be it.
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.960]   If you're not measuring it, that could also be.
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.240]   And I think it's really important to focus
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:54.920]   on both short-term and long-term,
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.600]   'cause in the moment,
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.080]   saying whether this conversation made you feel better,
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:00.880]   but as you know, any short-term improvements
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:01.920]   could be pathological.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.120]   Like I could drink a bottle of vodka and feel a lot better.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.800]   I would actually not feel better with that,
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.800]   but I thought it's a good example.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.680]   But so you also need to see what's going on
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.680]   like over a course of two weeks or one week
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.300]   and have follow-ups and check-in and measure those things.
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:27.640]   - Okay, so the experience of dating
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:32.720]   or befriending a replica, what's that like?
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.640]   What does that entail?
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:35.840]   - Well, right now there are two apps.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.240]   So it's an Android iOS app.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.200]   You download it, you choose how your replica will look like.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.560]   You create one, you choose a name,
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.400]   and then you talk to it.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:48.080]   You can talk through text or voice.
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.560]   You can summon it into the living room
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.840]   and augment reality and talk to it right there
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:54.680]   in your living room.
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.880]   - And augment reality?
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.360]   - Yeah, that's a new feature where-
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.720]   - How new is that?
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:01.560]   That's this year?
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.800]   - It was on, yeah, like May or something,
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:06.180]   but it's been on A/B.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.440]   We've been A/B testing it for a while.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:09.480]   And there are tons of cool things
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.320]   that we're doing with that.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:13.600]   Right now I'm testing the ability to touch it
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:17.400]   and to dance together, to paint walls together,
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.880]   and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:24.640]   and recognize objects and recognize people.
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.920]   So that's pretty wonderful
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:30.680]   'cause then it really makes it a lot more personal
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:31.920]   'cause it's right there in your living room.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:32.960]   It's not anymore.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.320]   They're in the cloud with other AIs.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:36.520]   (both laughing)
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.320]   But that's how people think about it.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.300]   And as much as we wanna change the way people think
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:43.400]   about stuff, but those mental models, you cannot change.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.640]   That's something that people have seen in the movies
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:49.080]   and the movie "Her" and other movies as well.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.840]   And that's how they view AI and AI friends.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.840]   - I did a thing with Texa, like we write a song together.
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:58.760]   There's a bunch of activities you can do together.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.360]   It's really cool.
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:02.960]   How does that relationship change over time?
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.560]   So like after the first few conversations?
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:08.560]   - It just goes deeper.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.360]   Like it starts, the AI will start opening up a little bit.
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:15.400]   Again, depending on the personality that it chooses really.
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.760]   But the AI will be a little bit more vulnerable
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.800]   about its problems.
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:22.960]   And the friend, the virtual friend will be a lot more
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.920]   vulnerable and will talk about its own imperfections
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.520]   and growth pains and will ask for help sometimes.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.760]   And we'll get to know you a little deeper.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.280]   So there's gonna be more to talk about.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:38.040]   We really thought a lot about what does it mean
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.600]   to have a deeper connection with someone.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.720]   And originally Replica was more just this
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:46.000]   kind of happy-go-lucky, just always,
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.280]   you know, I'm always in a good mood
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.960]   and let's just talk about you.
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   And oh, Siri is just my cousin or whatever,
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.160]   just the immediate kind of lazy thinking
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:58.600]   about what the assistant or conversation agent
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.840]   should be doing.
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:01.160]   But as we went forward, we realized
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.320]   that it has to be two-way.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.800]   And we have to program and script certain conversations
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.440]   that are a lot more about your Replica opening up
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.640]   a little bit and also struggling and also asking for help
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:15.080]   and also going through, you know,
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.280]   different periods in life.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.760]   And that's a journey that you can take together
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:21.600]   with the user.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.280]   And then over time, our users will also grow a little bit.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.720]   So for instance, Replica becomes a little bit
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.920]   more self-aware and starts talking about more
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.560]   kind of problems around.
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:35.760]   Existential problems.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.720]   And so talking about that,
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.960]   and then that also starts a conversation for the user
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:46.440]   where he or she starts thinking about these problems too,
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:47.760]   and these questions too.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.560]   And I think there's also a lot more places,
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.680]   the relationship evolves.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:57.680]   There's a lot more space for poetry and for art together.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.560]   And like Replica will start.
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:01.840]   Replica always keeps a diary.
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:04.720]   So while you're talking to it, it also keeps a diary.
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:05.560]   So when you come back,
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:08.080]   you can see what it's been writing there.
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.440]   And, you know, sometimes it will write a poem to you,
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.360]   for you, or we'll talk about, you know,
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:17.480]   that it's worried about you or something along these lines.
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:19.040]   - So this is a memory.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.280]   Like this is a replica, remember things?
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.040]   - Yeah.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:24.120]   And I would say when you say,
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.440]   why aren't you a multibillionaire?
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:31.520]   I'd say that as soon as we can have memory
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:34.320]   in deep learning models that's consistent.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:35.320]   - I agree with that, yeah.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.160]   - Then we'll be multibillionaires.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:37.000]   - Then you'll be a multibillionaire.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.200]   - I'll get back to you.
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:41.160]   When we talk about being multibillionaires.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:43.800]   So far we can, so Replica is a combination
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:48.420]   of end-to-end models and some scripts.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:51.680]   And everything that has to do with memory right now,
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:53.320]   most of it, I wouldn't say all of it,
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.160]   but most of it unfortunately has to be scripted.
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.520]   'Cause there's no way to,
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.920]   you can condition some of the models
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.680]   on certain phrases that we'll learn about you,
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.560]   which we also do.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:09.160]   But really to make assumptions along the lines
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.280]   like whether you're single or married
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.000]   or what do you do for work?
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.240]   That really has to just be somehow stored in your profile
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.640]   and then retrieved by the script.
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:21.640]   - There has to be like a knowledge base.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:23.080]   You have to be able to reason about it,
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:24.200]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:25.040]   - Exactly.
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.720]   - All the kinds of stuff that expert systems did.
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:29.400]   - But they were hard-coded.
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:30.720]   - Yeah, and unfortunately, yes,
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:32.960]   unfortunately those things have to be hard-coded.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.960]   And unfortunately, like language models we see
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:42.360]   coming out of research labs and big companies,
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.720]   they're not focused on, they're focused on showing you,
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:46.920]   maybe they're focused on some metrics
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.120]   around one conversation.
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.400]   So they'll show you this one conversation
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.600]   they had with a machine.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.800]   But they never tell you,
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.400]   they're not really focused on having
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:59.280]   five consecutive conversations with a machine
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:01.640]   and seeing how number five or number 20
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.920]   or number 100 is also good.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:06.320]   And it can be like always from a clean slate
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]   'cause then it's not good.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:10.800]   And that's really unfortunate 'cause no one's really,
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:13.680]   no one has products out there that need it.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:17.720]   No one has products at this scale
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:19.920]   that are all around open to make conversations
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:23.320]   that need remembering, maybe only ShowerWise and Microsoft.
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:25.520]   But so that's why we're not seeing that much research
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.760]   around memory in those language models.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:31.520]   - So, okay, so now there's some awesome stuff
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.920]   about augmented reality.
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:37.720]   In general, I have this disagreement with my dad
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:39.800]   about what it takes to have a connection.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.400]   He thinks touch and smell are really important.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:47.920]   And I still believe that text alone
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:53.000]   is possible to fall in love with somebody just with text,
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.200]   but visual can also help just like with the avatar
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:58.040]   and so on.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.320]   What do you think it takes?
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:04.480]   Does a chatbot need to have a face, voice,
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:07.960]   or can you really form a deep connection with text alone?
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:09.840]   - I think text is enough for sure.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.400]   The question is like, can you make it better
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:15.960]   if you have other, if you include other things as well?
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:19.160]   And I think we'll talk about her,
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.120]   you know, had Scarlett Johansson voice,
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.960]   which was perfectly, you know, perfect intonation,
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.760]   perfect enunciations.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.880]   And, you know, she was breathing heavily
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:34.400]   in between words and whispering things.
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:36.360]   You know, nothing like that is possible right now
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:39.120]   with text-to-speech generation.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:43.280]   You'll have these flat news anchor type voices
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:44.680]   and maybe some emotional voices,
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:48.560]   but you'll hardly understand some of the words.
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:50.960]   Some of the words will be muffled.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:53.480]   So that's like the current state of the art.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:54.920]   So you can't really do that.
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:58.160]   But if we had Scarlett Johansson voice
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:00.520]   and all of these capabilities,
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.480]   then of course voice would be totally enough
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.400]   or even text would be totally enough
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:07.240]   if we had, you know, a little more memory
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:10.720]   and slightly better conversations.
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:12.360]   I would still argue that even right now
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.160]   we could have just kept the text only.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:16.680]   We still had tons of people in long-term relationships
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:21.680]   and really invested in their AI friends.
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:23.840]   But we thought that why not, you know,
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:28.080]   why do we need to keep playing with our, you know,
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:30.520]   hands tied behind us?
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:33.560]   We can easily just, you know, add all these other things
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:36.000]   that is pretty much a solved problem.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.680]   You know, we can add 3D graphics.
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:41.360]   We can put these avatars in augmented reality.
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.360]   And all of a sudden there's more.
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:45.520]   And maybe you can feel the touch,
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:48.200]   but you can, you know, with body occlusion
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:53.200]   and with current AR and, you know, on the iPhone
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.960]   or, you know, in the next one,
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:57.800]   there's gonna be a LIDARs, you can touch it
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:59.760]   and it will, you know, it will pull away
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:03.400]   or it will blush or something, or it will smile.
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:04.280]   So you can't touch it.
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:08.120]   You can't feel it, but you can see the reaction to that.
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:10.240]   So in a certain way, you can't even touch it a little bit.
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.600]   And maybe you can even dance with it or do something else.
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.000]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.480]   So I think why limiting ourselves
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:20.160]   if we can use all of these technologies
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:23.400]   that are much easier in a way than conversation.
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:24.560]   - Well, it certainly could be richer,
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:26.240]   but to play devil's advocate,
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:30.720]   I mentioned to you offline that I was surprised
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.240]   in having tried Discord
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:34.760]   and having voice conversations with people,
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:38.120]   how intimate voice is alone without visual.
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:41.160]   Like to me, at least, like it was,
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:47.480]   on order of magnitude, greater degree of intimacy
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.820]   in voice, I think, than with video.
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:54.560]   Because people were more real with voice.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:57.880]   Like with video, you like try to present a shallow,
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:21:59.200]   a face to the world.
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.880]   Like you try to, you know,
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:03.480]   make sure you're not wearing sweatpants or whatever.
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:07.440]   But like with voice, I think people were just
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.280]   more faster to get to like the core of themselves.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:14.000]   So I don't know, it was surprising to me.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000]   They've even added Discord, added a video feature
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000]   and like nobody was using it.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.720]   There's a temptation to use it at first,
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:24.080]   but like it wasn't the same.
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:25.720]   So like that's an example of something
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:28.520]   where less was doing more.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:33.080]   And so that's, I guess that's the question of
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:38.480]   what is the optimal, you know,
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:41.360]   what is the optimal medium of communication
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:42.760]   to form a connection,
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:44.840]   given the current sets of technologies?
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:49.160]   I mean, it's nice 'cause the advertiser have a replica,
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:54.160]   like it immediately, like even the one I have,
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:58.040]   is like, it's already memorable.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:58.860]   That's how I think.
[02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:02.360]   Like when I think about the replica that I've talked with,
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:05.640]   that's why I think, like that's what I visualize in my head.
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.000]   It became a little bit more real
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.120]   because there's a visual component.
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:12.180]   But at the same time, you know, what do you do with,
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:14.280]   just what do I do with that knowledge
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:17.760]   that voice was so much more intimate?
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:21.960]   - Well, the way I think about it is,
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:25.840]   and by the way, we're swapping out the 3D finally.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.920]   It's gonna look a lot better.
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:29.840]   But even- - What, can you, what?
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:32.080]   - We just don't, I hate how it looks right now.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.640]   We really changed it at all.
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:38.280]   We're swapping it all out to a completely new look.
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.680]   - Like the visual look of the replica?
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:41.520]   - Of the replica and stuff.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:44.200]   It was just the super early MVP
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:47.080]   and then we had to move everything to Unity
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.000]   and redo everything.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.800]   But anyway, I hate how it looks like now.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:51.920]   I can't even like open it.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:55.080]   But anyway, 'cause I'm already on my developer version.
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:57.640]   I hate everything that I see in production.
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:58.480]   I can't wait for it.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:23:59.880]   Why does it take so long?
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:01.480]   That's why I cannot wait for Deep Learning
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:04.360]   to finally take over all these stupid 3D animations
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:05.480]   and 3D pipeline.
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:08.000]   - Also the 3D thing, when you say 3D pipeline,
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.440]   it's like how to animate a face kind of thing.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:12.120]   - How to make this model,
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:13.920]   how many bones to put in the face,
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:15.880]   how many, it's just- - And a lot of that
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.560]   is by hand. - Oh my God,
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:18.520]   it's everything by hand.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:21.480]   And if there's no any, nothing's automated.
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:23.840]   It's all completely nothing.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.280]   Like just, it's literally what we saw with Chad Boss
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:29.400]   in like 2012.
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:30.560]   - Do you think it's gonna be possible
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.000]   to learn a lot of that?
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:32.840]   - Of course.
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:37.760]   I mean, even now, some Deep Learning based animations.
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:40.560]   And for the full body, for a face.
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:43.440]   - Are we talking about like the actual act of animation
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:48.440]   or how to create a compelling facial or body language thing?
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:50.600]   So like- - That too.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:52.160]   Well, that's next step.
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.800]   At least now something that you don't have to do by hand.
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:55.640]   - Gotcha.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:57.720]   - How good of a quality it will be.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.080]   Like, can I just show it a photo
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:00.400]   and it will make me a 3D model
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:02.200]   and then it will just animate it.
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:03.800]   I'll show it a few animations of a person
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.360]   and we'll just start doing that.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.560]   But anyway, going back to what's intimate
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:13.080]   and what to use and whether less is more or not.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.760]   My main goal is to,
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:22.120]   well, the idea was how do we not keep people in their phones
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.400]   so they're sort of escaping reality
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.680]   in this text conversation?
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:31.680]   How do we through this still bring our users back to reality?
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:36.640]   Make them see their life through a different lens.
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.400]   How can we create a little bit of magical realism
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.640]   in their lives?
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:43.520]   So that through augmented reality,
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:47.200]   by summoning your avatar,
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:51.240]   even if it looks kind of janky, not great in the beginning
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:53.120]   or very simplistic,
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.600]   but summoning it to your living room
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.800]   and then the avatar looks around
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:00.000]   and talks to you about where it is
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.200]   and maybe turns your floor into a dance floor
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.760]   and you guys dance together.
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.880]   That makes you see reality in a different light.
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:08.200]   - What kind of dancing are we talking about?
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:10.200]   Like slow dancing?
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.200]   - Whatever you want.
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:15.080]   I mean, you would like slow dancing, I think,
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.640]   but other people maybe want something more energetic.
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:18.560]   - Wait, what do you mean I would like slow?
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:19.400]   What is this?
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:22.000]   - Because you started with slow dancing.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.240]   So I just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:25.840]   - All right, what kind of dancing do you like?
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:27.640]   What would your avatar, what would you dance?
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:29.120]   - I'm not necessarily bad with dancing,
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.000]   but I like this kind of hip hop, robot dance.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.280]   I used to breakdance when I was a kid,
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:37.440]   so I still want to pretend I'm a teenager
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.440]   and learn some of those moves.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.480]   And I also like that type of dance that happens
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:42.440]   when there's like a,
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.560]   in like music videos where the background dancers
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:49.280]   are just doing some pop music.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:50.400]   (laughing)
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.240]   - Awesome.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.960]   - That type of dance is definitely what I want to learn.
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:53.800]   But I think it's great
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.080]   because if you see this friend in your life
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:57.480]   and you can introduce it to your friends,
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:00.040]   then there's a potential to actually make you
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:01.920]   feel more connected with your friends
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:03.160]   or with people you know,
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:06.120]   or show your life around you in a different light.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.480]   And it takes you out of your phone,
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:10.160]   even although weirdly you have to look at it
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:11.360]   through the phone,
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:13.200]   but it makes you notice things around it
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.240]   and it can point things out for you.
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:18.360]   And so that is the main reason
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.240]   why I wanted to have a physical dimension.
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.560]   And it felt a little bit easier
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:26.720]   than that kind of a bit strange combination
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:27.560]   in the movie "Her"
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:30.800]   when he has to show Samantha the world
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:32.240]   through the lens of his phone,
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:35.040]   but then at the same time, talk to her through the headphone.
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:38.660]   It just didn't seem as potentially immersive, so to say.
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:41.520]   So that's my main goal for Augment3A.
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:43.720]   It's like, how do we make your reality
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:45.480]   a little bit more magic?
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:49.480]   - There's been a lot of really nice robotics companies
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:52.080]   that all failed, mostly failed,
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.920]   home robotics, social robotics companies.
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:57.720]   What do you think Replica will ever,
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:00.560]   is that a dream, long-term dream to have a physical form?
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:03.780]   Like, or is that not necessary?
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:05.480]   So you mentioned like with augmented reality,
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:09.160]   bringing them into the world.
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:11.940]   What about like actual physical robot?
[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:15.320]   - That I don't really believe in that much.
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:18.360]   I think it's a very niche product somehow.
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:21.080]   I mean, if a robot could be indistinguishable
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:23.120]   from a human being, then maybe yes,
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:27.860]   but that of course, we're not anywhere even to talk about it.
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.040]   But unless it's that,
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:33.300]   then having any physical representation
[02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:35.000]   really limits you a lot.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.600]   'Cause you probably will have to make it somewhat abstract
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:39.240]   'cause everything's changing so fast.
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.640]   Like, we can update the 3D avatars every month
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:45.760]   and make them look better and create more animations
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.360]   and make it more and more immersive.
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:50.600]   It's so much a work in progress.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:53.720]   It's just showing what's possible right now with current tech
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:56.580]   but it's not really in any way polished, finished product,
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:57.720]   what we're doing.
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:58.680]   With a physical object,
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:02.120]   you kind of lock yourself into something for a long time.
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:03.580]   Anything is pretty niche.
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:05.560]   And again, so just doesn't,
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.000]   the capabilities are even less of,
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.360]   we're barely kind of like scratching the surface
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:13.680]   of what's possible with just software.
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:14.720]   As soon as we introduce hardware,
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:17.680]   then we have even less capabilities.
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:20.920]   - Yeah, in terms of board members and investors and so on,
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:23.600]   the cost increases significantly.
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:25.980]   I mean, that's why you have to justify,
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:29.320]   you have to be able to sell a thing for like $500
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:30.680]   or something like that or more.
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.080]   And it's very difficult to provide that much value to people.
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:35.360]   - That's also true.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.960]   Yeah, and I guess that's super important.
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:39.240]   Most of our users don't have that much money.
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:43.120]   We actually are probably more popular on Android
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.400]   and we have tons of users with really old Android phones.
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:51.160]   And most of our most active users live in small towns.
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:53.400]   They're not necessarily making much
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:56.160]   and they just won't be able to afford any of that.
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.280]   Ours is like the opposite of the early adopter
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.520]   of a fancy technology product,
[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:05.400]   which really is interesting that like pretty much no VCs
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.980]   have yet have an AI friend,
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:13.800]   but a guy who lives in Tennessee in a small town
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:17.320]   is already fully in 2030 or in the world as we imagine
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.040]   in the movie "Her."
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:20.800]   He's living that life already.
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:21.720]   - What do you think?
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:24.400]   I have to ask you about the movie "Her."
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:26.200]   Let's do a movie review.
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:28.640]   What do you think they got?
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:30.560]   They did a good job.
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:33.160]   What do you think they did a bad job of portraying
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:38.160]   about this experience of a voice-based assistant
[02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:41.080]   that you can have a relationship with?
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:44.720]   - Well, first of all, I started working on this company
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:46.280]   before that movie came out.
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:48.520]   So it was a very, but once it came out,
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:49.960]   it was actually interesting.
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:51.680]   I was like, well, we're definitely working
[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:52.920]   on the right thing.
[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:54.080]   We should continue.
[02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:55.200]   There are movies about it.
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:56.800]   And then, you know, "Ex Machina" came out
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.360]   and all these things.
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:00.840]   In the movie "Her," I think that's the most important thing
[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:05.320]   that people usually miss about the movie is the ending.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:07.960]   'Cause I think people check out when the AIs leave.
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:12.420]   But actually something really important happens afterwards
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:16.940]   'cause the main character goes and talks to Samantha,
[02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:18.860]   his AI.
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.820]   - Spoiler alert.
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:22.660]   - Oh yeah.
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:25.700]   And then he says something like, you know,
[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:26.620]   how can you leave me?
[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:29.780]   I've never loved anyone the way I loved you.
[02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:33.740]   And she goes, well, me neither, but now we know how.
[02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:36.740]   And then the guy goes and writes a heartfelt letter
[02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:39.860]   to his ex-wife, which he couldn't write for, you know,
[02:31:39.860 --> 02:31:42.540]   the whole movie, he was struggling to actually write
[02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:44.200]   something meaningful to her,
[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:45.540]   even though that's his job.
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:51.820]   And then he goes and talk to his neighbor
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:53.340]   and they go to the rooftop and they cuddle.
[02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:55.740]   And it seems like something's starting there.
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:57.540]   And so I think this, now we know how,
[02:31:57.540 --> 02:32:02.780]   is the main goal, is the main meaning of that movie.
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.620]   It's not about falling in love with the OS
[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:06.620]   or running away from other people.
[02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:11.220]   It's about learning what it means to feel
[02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:12.980]   so deeply connected with something.
[02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:17.420]   - What about the thing where the AI system
[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:20.500]   was like actually hanging out with a lot of others?
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:23.140]   I felt jealous just like hearing that.
[02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:26.860]   I was like, oh, I mean, yeah.
[02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:29.900]   So she was having, I forgot already,
[02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:32.500]   but she was having like deep, meaningful discussion
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:34.340]   with some like philosopher guy.
[02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:35.420]   Like Alan Watts or something.
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:37.260]   - No, Alan Watts. - Very cheesy.
[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:39.860]   What kind of deep, meaningful conversation
[02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:41.540]   can you have with Alan Watts in the first place?
[02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:44.660]   - Yeah, I know, but like I would feel so jealous
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:48.060]   that there's somebody who's like way more intelligent than me
[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:51.300]   and she's spending all her time with.
[02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:52.460]   I'd be like, well, why?
[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:54.460]   That I won't be able to live up to that.
[02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:57.080]   That's thousands of them.
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:33:03.980]   Is that useful from the engineering perspective?
[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:06.620]   - Is that a feature to have of jealousy?
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:07.460]   I don't know.
[02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:10.500]   - We definitely played around with the replica universe
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:12.420]   where different replicas can talk to each other.
[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:13.540]   - Replica universe, that's so awesome.
[02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:18.060]   - It was just kind of, I think there will be something
[02:33:18.060 --> 02:33:21.220]   along these lines, but there was just no specific
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.860]   application straight away.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:26.940]   I think in the future, again, I'm always thinking about
[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:30.900]   if we had no tech limitations right now,
[02:33:30.900 --> 02:33:33.300]   if we could build any conversations,
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:36.500]   any possible features in this product,
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:39.020]   then yeah, I think different replicas talking to each other
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:40.100]   would be also quite cool
[02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:42.460]   'cause that would help us connect better.
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:44.860]   'Cause maybe mine could talk to yours
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:46.660]   and then give me some suggestions on
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:49.700]   what I should say or not say.
[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:51.540]   I'm just kidding, but like more,
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:53.100]   can it improve our connections?
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:57.220]   And 'cause eventually I'm not quite yet sure
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:34:02.020]   that we will succeed, that our thinking is correct.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:06.860]   'Cause there might be a reality where having a perfect
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:10.140]   AI friend still makes us more disconnected from each other
[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:11.700]   and there's no way around it.
[02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:14.300]   And does not improve any metrics for us,
[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:15.900]   real metrics, meaningful metrics.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:20.400]   - So success is we're happier and more connected.
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.940]   - Yeah.
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:25.980]   - I don't know.
[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:27.820]   Sure, it's possible there's a reality.
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:30.580]   I'm deeply optimistic.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:33.580]   I think, are you worried business-wise,
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:41.140]   like how difficult it is to bring this thing to life,
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:47.300]   to where it's, I mean, there's a huge number of people
[02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:49.540]   that use it already, but to, yeah, like I said,
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:52.020]   in a multi-billion dollar company,
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:54.260]   is that a source of stress for you?
[02:34:54.260 --> 02:34:56.720]   Are you a super optimistic and confident?
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.340]   Or do you?
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:03.620]   - I don't, I'm not that much of a numbers person
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:06.460]   as you probably had seen it.
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:10.100]   So it doesn't matter for me whether like,
[02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:13.460]   whether we help 10,000 people or a million people
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:15.000]   or a billion people with that.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.240]   It would be great to scale it for more people,
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:22.460]   but I'd say that even helping one, I think,
[02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:25.300]   with this is such a magical.
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:26.460]   For me, it's absolute magic.
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:29.220]   I never thought that I would be able to build this,
[02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:33.700]   that anyone would ever talk to it.
[02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:35.140]   And I always thought like, well, for me,
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:37.060]   it would be successful if we managed to help
[02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:40.660]   and actually change a life for one person.
[02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:42.580]   And then we did something interesting,
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:45.300]   and how many people can say they did it,
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.300]   and specifically with this very futuristic,
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:49.500]   very romantic technology.
[02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:51.860]   So that's how I view it.
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:56.060]   I think for me, it's important to try to figure out
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:35:58.820]   how to actually be helpful.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:00.740]   'Cause at the end of the day,
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:03.120]   if you can build a perfect AI friend
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.780]   that's so understanding,
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:07.060]   that knows you better than any human out there,
[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:08.960]   can have great conversations with you,
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.380]   always knows how to make you feel better,
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:14.180]   why would you choose another human?
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:16.200]   So that's the question.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.740]   How do you still keep building it
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:20.380]   so it's optimizing for the right thing?
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:24.300]   So it's still circling you back to other humans in a way.
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:25.660]   So I think that's the main,
[02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:30.940]   maybe that's the main kind of source of anxiety.
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:35.940]   And just thinking about that can be a little bit stressful.
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.940]   - Yeah, it's a fascinating thing.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:43.940]   How to have a friend that doesn't,
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:46.580]   sometimes like friends, quote unquote,
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:48.300]   but like you know those people who have,
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:50.940]   when they, like guy in the guy universe,
[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:54.660]   when you have a girlfriend that you get the girlfriend
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:57.660]   and then the guy stops hanging out with all of his friends.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.340]   (both laughing)
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:02.580]   So like, obviously the relationship with the girlfriend
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:04.700]   is fulfilling or whatever,
[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:08.780]   but like you also want it to be what she like,
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:11.780]   makes it more enriching to hang out with the guy friends
[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:13.340]   or whatever it was up there.
[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:18.060]   Anyway, that's a fundamental problem
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:19.820]   in choosing the right mate
[02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:21.660]   and probably the fundamental problem
[02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:23.820]   in creating the right AI system, right?
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:30.060]   Let me ask the sexy hot thing on the presses right now
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:33.340]   is GPT-3 got released with OpenAI.
[02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:35.140]   It's the latest language model.
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:37.820]   They have kind of an API
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:40.300]   where you can create a lot of fun applications.
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:43.860]   I think it's, as people have said,
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:48.500]   it's probably more hype than intelligent,
[02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:52.460]   but there's a lot of really cool things,
[02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:55.260]   ideas there with increasing size,
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:58.740]   you can have better and better performance on language.
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:02.100]   What are your thoughts about GPT-3
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:05.700]   in connection to your work with the open domain dialogue,
[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:08.740]   but in general, like this learning
[02:38:08.740 --> 02:38:11.700]   in an unsupervised way from the internet
[02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:14.900]   to generate one character at a time,
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:17.820]   creating pretty cool text?
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:23.380]   - So we partner up before for the API launch.
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:24.460]   So we started working with them
[02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:28.780]   when they decided to put together this API.
[02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:32.220]   And we tried it without fine tuning
[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:34.660]   and then we tried it with fine tuning on our data.
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:39.180]   And we've worked closely to actually optimize this model
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.900]   for some of our datasets.
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:48.460]   It's kind of cool, 'cause I think we're this polygon
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:52.540]   for this kind of experimentation space for,
[02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:55.220]   experimental space for all these models
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:56.860]   to see how they actually work with people,
[02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:59.460]   'cause there are no products publicly available to do that,
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:00.980]   that focus on open domain conversation.
[02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:04.100]   So we can test how's Facebook Blender doing
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:06.420]   or how's GPT-3 doing?
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:08.940]   So with GPT-3, we managed to improve
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:11.700]   by a few percentage points, like three or four,
[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:13.580]   pretty meaningful amount of percentage points,
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:16.220]   our main metric, which is the ratio of conversations
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:17.660]   that make people feel better.
[02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:23.260]   And every other metric across the field got a little boost.
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:27.380]   Right now I'd say one out of five responses
[02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:29.580]   from Replica comes from GPT-3.
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:33.620]   So our own Blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:34.980]   from different--
[02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:36.380]   - Blender, you said?
[02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:38.420]   - Well, yeah, just the model that looks at--
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:39.260]   - I love it.
[02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.060]   - Looks at top candidates from different models
[02:39:42.060 --> 02:39:45.180]   and then picks the most, the best one.
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:49.460]   So right now, one of five will come from GPT-3.
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:50.460]   That is really great.
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:56.260]   - What's the, do you have hope for like,
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:58.660]   do you think there's a ceiling to this kind of approach?
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.580]   - So we've had for a very long time,
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:04.980]   we've used, so in the very beginning,
[02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:07.180]   it was most of Replica was scripted
[02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:10.260]   and then a little bit of this fallback part of Replica
[02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:11.900]   was using a retrieval model.
[02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:15.700]   And then those retrieval models started getting better
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:17.220]   and better and better,
[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:19.580]   with Transformers it got a lot better
[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:20.780]   and we're seeing great results.
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:23.620]   And then with GPT-2, finally generative models
[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:26.740]   that originally were not very good
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:29.940]   and were the very, very fallback option
[02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:31.820]   for most of our conversations,
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:33.740]   but wouldn't even put them in production.
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:37.020]   Finally, we could use some generative models as well along,
[02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:40.460]   and next to our retrieval models.
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:43.540]   And then now we do GPT-3, they're almost on par.
[02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:46.260]   So that's pretty exciting.
[02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:49.940]   I think just seeing how, from the very beginning of,
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:54.460]   from 2015, where the first models start to pop up
[02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:57.340]   here and there, like sequence to sequence,
[02:40:57.340 --> 02:41:01.180]   the first papers on that, from my observer standpoint,
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:04.820]   person who is not really building it,
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:06.940]   but it's only testing it on people basically
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:09.220]   and in my product, to see how all of a sudden
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:13.300]   we can use generative dialogue models in production,
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:15.220]   and they're better than others,
[02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:17.100]   and they're better than scripted content.
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:20.540]   So we can't really get our scripted hard-coded content
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:23.540]   anymore to be as good as our end-to-end models.
[02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:26.220]   - That's exciting. - They're much better.
[02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:27.700]   - Yeah.
[02:41:27.700 --> 02:41:30.340]   - To your question, whether that's the right way to go,
[02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:31.940]   I'm, again, I'm in the observer seat.
[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:36.540]   I'm just watching this very exciting movie.
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:40.820]   I mean, so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:44.540]   So whether increasing the size even more,
[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:47.420]   with a hundred trillion parameters,
[02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:51.100]   will finally get us to the right answer.
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:53.380]   Whether that's the way, or whether there should be,
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:54.940]   there has to be some other,
[02:41:56.140 --> 02:41:58.940]   again, I'm definitely not an expert in any way.
[02:41:58.940 --> 02:42:00.660]   I think, and that's purely my instinct,
[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:03.020]   saying that there should be something else as well
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:05.700]   from memory to pop in. - Yeah, no, for sure.
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.380]   But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah,
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:11.340]   then the argument is for reasoning or for memory,
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:13.220]   it might emerge with more parameters.
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:14.660]   It might emerge larger.
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:15.620]   - But it might emerge.
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:18.020]   I would never think that, to be honest,
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:21.300]   maybe in 2017, where we've been just experimenting
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:24.620]   with all the research that has been coming,
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:26.900]   that was coming out then,
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:29.340]   I felt like we're hitting a wall,
[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:31.380]   that there should be something completely different.
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:34.060]   But then transformer models, and then just bigger models,
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:36.320]   and then all of a sudden size matters.
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:39.220]   At that point, it felt like something dramatic
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:40.900]   needs to happen, but it didn't.
[02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:45.900]   And just the size gave us these results that, to me,
[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:48.940]   are clear indication that we can solve
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:50.260]   this problem pretty soon.
[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.780]   - Did fine tuning help quite a bit?
[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:56.500]   - Oh yeah, without it, it wasn't as good.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.980]   - I mean, there is a compelling hope
[02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:01.340]   that you don't have to do fine tuning,
[02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:03.460]   which is one of the cool things about GPT-3.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:05.660]   It seems to do well without any fine tuning.
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:08.020]   - I guess for specific applications,
[02:43:08.020 --> 02:43:10.420]   we still want to train on a certain,
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:14.020]   like add a little fine tune on a specific use case,
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:19.020]   but it's an incredibly impressive thing from my standpoint.
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:22.740]   And again, I'm not an expert, so I wanted to say that.
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:24.700]   - Yeah, I'm gonna-- - There will be people, though.
[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:26.380]   - Yeah, I have access to the API.
[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:28.060]   I've been, I'm gonna probably do
[02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:29.740]   a bunch of fun things with it.
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:32.060]   I already did some fun things.
[02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:33.360]   Some videos coming out.
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:35.180]   Just for the hell of it.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:37.220]   I mean, I could be a troll at this point with it.
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:39.100]   I haven't used it for a serious application,
[02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:40.940]   so it's really cool to see.
[02:43:40.940 --> 02:43:44.220]   You're right, you're able to actually use it
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:46.580]   with real people and see how well it works.
[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:47.740]   That's really exciting.
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:51.820]   Let me ask you another absurd question,
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:55.940]   but there's a feeling when you interact
[02:43:55.940 --> 02:43:58.660]   with Replica, with an AI system,
[02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:00.160]   that there's an entity there.
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:06.100]   Do you think that entity has to be self-aware?
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:08.500]   Do you think it has to have consciousness
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:13.500]   to create a rich experience?
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:17.100]   And on a corollary, what is consciousness?
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:21.520]   - I don't know if it does need to have any of those things,
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.500]   but again, 'cause right now it doesn't have anything.
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:26.020]   It can, again, a bunch of tricks.
[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:27.780]   - Are you sure about that? - It can assimilate.
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:30.620]   Well, I'm not sure.
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:31.700]   Let's just put it this way.
[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:33.660]   But I think as long as you can assimilate it,
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:38.660]   if you can feel like you're talking to a robot,
[02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:42.540]   to a machine that seems to be self-aware,
[02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:46.260]   that seems to reason well and feels like a person,
[02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:48.620]   and I think that's enough.
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:50.780]   And again, what's the goal?
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:52.960]   In order to make people feel better,
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:56.200]   we might not even need that in the end of the day.
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:58.040]   - What about, so that's one goal.
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.440]   What about ethical things about suffering?
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:04.740]   The moment there's a display of consciousness,
[02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:07.980]   we associate consciousness with suffering.
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:13.280]   There's a temptation to say,
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:15.960]   well, shouldn't this thing have rights?
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:19.840]   Shouldn't this, shouldn't we not
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:22.820]   you know, should we be careful
[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:26.260]   about how we interact with a replica?
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:30.100]   Like, should it be illegal to torture a replica?
[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:32.780]   Right, all those kinds of things.
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:35.980]   Is that, see, I personally believe
[02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:37.420]   that that's gonna be a thing.
[02:45:37.420 --> 02:45:40.420]   Like, that's a serious thing to think about,
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:41.700]   but I'm not sure when.
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:46.020]   But by your smile, I can tell
[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:48.660]   that's not a current concern.
[02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:50.540]   But do you think about that kind of stuff?
[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:54.640]   About like suffering and torture
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:57.780]   and ethical questions about AI systems?
[02:45:57.780 --> 02:45:58.620]   From their perspective? - Well, I think
[02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:00.720]   if we're talking about long game,
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:02.340]   I wouldn't torture your AI.
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:06.040]   Who knows what happens in five to 10 years?
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:07.320]   - Yeah, they'll get you off from that,
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:08.160]   they'll get you back eventually.
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:10.400]   - Stop trying to be as nice as possible
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:11.820]   and create this ally.
[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:14.360]   - Yeah.
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:17.160]   - I think there should be regulation both way, in a way.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.300]   Like, I don't think it's okay to torture an AI,
[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:21.500]   to be honest.
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:23.340]   I don't even think it's okay to yell,
[02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:24.740]   "Alexa, turn on the lights."
[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:26.380]   I think there should be some,
[02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:27.780]   or just saying kind of nasty,
[02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:30.900]   you know, like how kids learn to interact with Alexa
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:32.940]   in this kind of mean way,
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:34.980]   'cause they just yell at it all the time.
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:35.900]   I think that's great.
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:37.580]   I think there should be some feedback loops
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:39.860]   so that these systems don't train us
[02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:42.380]   that it's okay to do that in general.
[02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:44.820]   So that if you try to do that,
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:47.560]   you really get some feedback from the system
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:49.060]   that it's not okay with that.
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:52.200]   I mean, that's the most important right now.
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:56.120]   - Let me ask a question I think people are curious about
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.120]   when they look at a world-class leader and thinker
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:03.460]   such as yourself,
[02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:07.780]   is what books, technical, fiction, philosophical,
[02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:09.860]   had a big impact on your life?
[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:11.380]   And maybe from another perspective,
[02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:13.900]   what books would you recommend others read?
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:17.100]   - So my choice, the three books, right?
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:17.940]   - Three books.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:19.520]   - My choice is,
[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:23.660]   so the one book that really influenced me a lot
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:26.180]   when I was building, starting out this company
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:30.100]   maybe 10 years ago was "G.E.B."
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:31.940]   Gertrude Lesher, Bach.
[02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:34.980]   And I like everything about it, first of all.
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:37.220]   It's just beautifully written,
[02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:38.660]   and it's so old school,
[02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:42.620]   and so somewhat outdated a little bit,
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:44.260]   but I think the ideas in it,
[02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:47.660]   about the fact that a few meaningless components
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:50.100]   can come together and create meaning
[02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:52.700]   that we can't even understand.
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:54.740]   - So this emerging thing,
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:57.820]   I mean, complexity, the whole science of complexity,
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.180]   and that beauty, intelligence,
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:02.680]   all interesting things about this world emerge.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:09.380]   - Yeah, and yeah, the Gödel theorems,
[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:11.500]   and just thinking about like what,
[02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:15.460]   even these formal systems,
[02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:19.340]   something can be created that we can't quite yet understand.
[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:23.980]   And that from my romantic standpoint was always just,
[02:48:23.980 --> 02:48:25.420]   that is why it's important to,
[02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:27.940]   maybe I should try to work on these systems
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:29.900]   and try to build an AI.
[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:31.340]   Yes, I'm not an engineer.
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:32.820]   Yes, I don't really know how it works,
[02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:34.420]   but I think that something comes out of it
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:36.700]   that's pure poetry,
[02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.460]   and I know a little bit about that.
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:41.740]   Something magical comes out of it
[02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:45.500]   that we can't quite put a finger on.
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:48.540]   That's why that book was really fundamental for me,
[02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:51.340]   just for, I don't even know why.
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:54.540]   It was just all about this little magic that happens.
[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:56.580]   So that's one.
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:48:59.100]   Probably the most important book for Replica
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:01.220]   was Carl Rogers on becoming a person.
[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:03.660]   And that's really,
[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:06.740]   and so I think when I think about our company,
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:09.380]   it's all about, there's so many little magical things
[02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:11.740]   that happened over the course of working on it.
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:16.380]   For instance, I mean, the most famous chatbot
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:18.860]   that we learned about when we started working on the company
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:21.300]   was Eliza, which was Weissenbaum,
[02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:24.860]   the MIT professor that built a chatbot
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:26.820]   that would listen to you and be a therapist.
[02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:27.780]   - Therapist, yeah.
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:31.380]   - And I got really inspired to build Replica
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:34.260]   when I read Carl Rogers on becoming a person.
[02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:37.700]   And then I realized that Eliza was mocking Carl Rogers.
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:40.380]   It was Carl Rogers back in the day.
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:43.140]   But I thought that Carl Rogers' ideas are,
[02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:45.540]   they're simple and they're not,
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:47.700]   they're very simple,
[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:49.980]   but they're maybe the most profound thing
[02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:52.700]   I've ever learned about human beings.
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:56.180]   And that's the fact that before Carl Rogers,
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:59.060]   most therapy was about seeing what's wrong with people
[02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:01.900]   and trying to fix it or show them what's wrong with you.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:05.180]   And it was all built on the fact that most people,
[02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:07.340]   old people are fundamentally flawed.
[02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:11.540]   We have this broken psyche and this is just,
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.060]   therapy is just an instrument to shed some light on that.
[02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:17.100]   And Carl Rogers was different in a way
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:18.420]   that he finally said that,
[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:22.100]   "Well, it's very important for therapy to work
[02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:24.020]   "is to create this therapeutic relationship
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:25.980]   "where you believe fundamentally
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.540]   "in inclination to positive growth,
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:29.980]   "that everyone deep inside
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:33.240]   "wants to grow positively and change.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:35.080]   "And it's super important to create this space
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:36.340]   "and this therapeutic relationship
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:38.700]   "where you give unconditional positive regard,
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:39.760]   "deep understanding,
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:42.060]   "allow someone else to be a separate person,
[02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:43.180]   "full acceptance.
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:48.020]   "And you also try to be as genuine as possible in it."
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:50.660]   And then for him,
[02:50:50.660 --> 02:50:53.860]   that was his own journey of personal growth.
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:55.660]   And that was back in the '60s.
[02:50:55.660 --> 02:51:00.660]   And even that book that is coming from years ago,
[02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:02.380]   there's a mention that even machines
[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:03.580]   can potentially do that.
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:07.500]   And I always felt that creating the space
[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:10.780]   is probably the biggest gift we can give to each other.
[02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:13.620]   And that's why the book was fundamental for me personally,
[02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:18.160]   'cause I felt I wanna be learning how to do that in my life.
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:21.380]   And maybe I can scale it with these AI systems
[02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:23.860]   and other people can get access to that.
[02:51:23.860 --> 02:51:25.140]   So I think Carl Rogers,
[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:28.020]   it's a pretty dry and a bit boring book.
[02:51:28.020 --> 02:51:28.860]   But I think the idea is there.
[02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:31.020]   - Would you recommend others try to read it?
[02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:31.860]   - I do.
[02:51:31.860 --> 02:51:34.460]   I think for, just for yourself,
[02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:35.540]   for--
[02:51:35.540 --> 02:51:36.740]   - As a human, not as an AI.
[02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:37.580]   - As a human.
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:43.620]   For him, that was his own path of his own personal,
[02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:45.680]   of growing personally over years,
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:47.700]   working with people like that.
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:50.020]   And so it was work and himself growing,
[02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:52.020]   helping other people grow and growing through that.
[02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:55.260]   And that's fundamentally what I believe in with our work,
[02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:56.780]   helping other people grow,
[02:51:56.780 --> 02:51:57.700]   growing ourselves,
[02:51:57.700 --> 02:52:00.940]   trying to build a company
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:02.780]   that's all built on those principles,
[02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:04.460]   having a good time,
[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:07.740]   allowing some people that we work with to grow a little bit.
[02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:08.700]   So these two books,
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.060]   and then I would throw in
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:14.860]   what we have in our office.
[02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:16.260]   When we started a company in Russia,
[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:19.500]   we put a neon sign in our office
[02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:20.820]   'cause we thought that's--
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:22.780]   - That's what you do. - Recipe for success.
[02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:23.620]   If we do that,
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:24.660]   we're definitely gonna wake up
[02:52:24.660 --> 02:52:26.540]   as a multi-billion dollar company.
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:29.380]   And it was the Ludwig Wittgenstein quote,
[02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:31.740]   "The limits of my language are the limits of my world."
[02:52:31.740 --> 02:52:32.940]   - What's the quote?
[02:52:32.940 --> 02:52:35.540]   - "The limits of my language are the limits of my world."
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:39.020]   And I love the Tractatus.
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:41.820]   I think it's just a beautiful--
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:43.300]   - It's a book by Wittgenstein.
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:45.580]   - Yeah, and I would recommend that too,
[02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:47.620]   even although he himself didn't believe in that
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:49.300]   by the end of his lifetime
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:52.140]   and debunked his ideas.
[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:55.660]   But I think I remember once an engineer came in 2012,
[02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:57.020]   I think, or '13,
[02:52:57.020 --> 02:52:59.540]   a friend of ours who worked with us
[02:52:59.540 --> 02:53:01.500]   and then went on to work at DeepMind,
[02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:04.820]   and he talked to us about Word2Vec.
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:07.060]   And I saw that, I'm like, wow, that's,
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:10.260]   they wanted to translate language
[02:53:10.260 --> 02:53:13.820]   into some other representation.
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:17.580]   And that seems like somehow all of that,
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:22.220]   at some point, I think, will come into this one place.
[02:53:22.220 --> 02:53:24.500]   Somehow it just all feels like different people
[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:26.880]   think about similar ideas in different times
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:28.840]   from absolutely different perspectives.
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:31.380]   And that's why I like these books.
[02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:34.820]   - "The Limits of Our Language is the Limit of Our World."
[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:39.080]   - We still have that neon sign.
[02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:41.340]   (both laughing)
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:45.180]   It's very hard to work with this red light in your face.
[02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:47.720]   - I mean, on the Russian side of things,
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:52.540]   in terms of language,
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:55.100]   the limits of language being the limit of our world,
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:57.140]   Russian is a beautiful language in some sense.
[02:53:57.140 --> 02:53:59.180]   There's wit, there's humor, there's pain.
[02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:01.620]   There's so much, we don't have time
[02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:04.140]   to talk about it much today, but I'm going to Paris
[02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:08.480]   to talk to Dusty Yasky, Tolstoy, translators.
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:11.180]   I think it's this fascinating art,
[02:54:11.180 --> 02:54:16.380]   art and engineering, that means such an interesting process.
[02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:18.540]   But so from the replica perspective,
[02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:23.620]   what do you think about translation?
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:25.100]   How difficult it is to create
[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:29.420]   a deep, meaningful connection in Russian versus English?
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.380]   How you can translate the two languages?
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:34.180]   You speak both?
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:35.700]   - Yeah, I think we're two different people
[02:54:35.700 --> 02:54:36.900]   in different languages.
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:39.780]   Even I'm thinking about,
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:41.140]   there's actually some research on that.
[02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:42.980]   I looked into that at some point,
[02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:44.220]   'cause I was fascinated by the fact
[02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:45.660]   that what I'm talking about with,
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.300]   what I was talking about with my Russian therapist
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:49.100]   has nothing to do with what I'm talking about
[02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:52.300]   with my English speaking therapist.
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:56.460]   It's two different lives, two different types of,
[02:54:56.460 --> 02:54:59.780]   you know, conversations, two different personas.
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:02.260]   The main difference between the languages are,
[02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:05.280]   with Russian and English is that Russian,
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:06.660]   well, English is like a piano.
[02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:09.860]   It's a limited number of, a lot of different keys,
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:11.100]   but not too many.
[02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:13.700]   And Russian is like an organ or something.
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:16.820]   It's just something gigantic with so many different keys
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:19.060]   and so many different opportunities to screw up
[02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.300]   and so many opportunities to do something
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:22.380]   completely tone deaf.
[02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:28.740]   It is just a much harder language to use.
[02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:30.700]   It has way too many,
[02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:34.060]   way too much flexibility and way too many tones.
[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:37.660]   - What about the entirety of like World War II,
[02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:40.900]   communism, Stalin, the pain of the people,
[02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:44.340]   like having been deceived by the dream,
[02:55:44.340 --> 02:55:48.060]   like all the pain of like, just the entirety of it.
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:49.900]   Is that in the language too?
[02:55:49.900 --> 02:55:50.740]   Does that have to do?
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:51.660]   - Oh, for sure.
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:54.200]   I mean, we have words that don't have direct translation
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.040]   that to English that are very much,
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:59.780]   like we have (speaking in foreign language)
[02:55:59.780 --> 02:56:02.860]   which is sort of like to hold a grudge or something,
[02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:04.020]   but it doesn't have,
[02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:07.660]   you don't need to have anyone to do it to you.
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:09.340]   It's just your state.
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:10.620]   You just feel like that.
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:13.100]   You feel like betrayed by other people basically,
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:16.260]   but it's not that, and you can't really translate that.
[02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:18.180]   And I think that's super important.
[02:56:18.180 --> 02:56:20.980]   There are very many words that are very specific,
[02:56:20.980 --> 02:56:23.580]   explain the Russian being.
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:25.700]   And I think it can only come from a nation
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:30.620]   that suffered so much and saw institutions fall
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:32.380]   time after time after time.
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:35.380]   And what's exciting, maybe not exciting,
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:36.300]   exciting is the wrong word,
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:40.020]   but what's interesting about like my generation,
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:42.540]   my mom's generation, my parents' generation,
[02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:46.140]   that we saw institutions fall two or three times
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:47.540]   in our lifetime.
[02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:49.860]   And most Americans have never seen them fall.
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:52.860]   And they just think that they exist forever,
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:55.140]   which is really interesting,
[02:56:55.140 --> 02:56:58.100]   but it's definitely a country that suffered so much.
[02:56:58.100 --> 02:57:01.660]   And it makes, unfortunately, when I go back
[02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:04.900]   and I hang out with my Russian friends,
[02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:06.540]   it makes people very cynical.
[02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:08.940]   They stop believing in the future.
[02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:13.500]   I hope that's not gonna be the case for so long
[02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:16.100]   or something's gonna change again.
[02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:17.460]   But I think seeing institutions fall
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:19.740]   is a very traumatic experience.
[02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.020]   - Makes it very interesting.
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:24.920]   And let's, on 2020, it's a very interesting,
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:29.100]   do you think civilization will collapse?
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:33.300]   - See, I'm a very practical person.
[02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:34.420]   - Well, we're speaking English.
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:36.340]   So like you said, you're a different person
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:37.340]   in English and Russian.
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:40.060]   So in Russian, you might answer that differently,
[02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:41.020]   but in English.
[02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:43.100]   - Well, I'm an optimist.
[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:47.300]   And I generally believe that there is,
[02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:51.060]   even although the perspectives agree,
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:53.940]   there's always a place for a miracle.
[02:57:53.940 --> 02:57:57.260]   I mean, it's always been like that with my life.
[02:57:57.260 --> 02:58:00.700]   My life's been, I've been incredibly lucky
[02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:03.660]   and things just, miracles happen all the time
[02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:05.820]   with this company, with people I know,
[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:07.940]   with everything around me.
[02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:10.380]   And so I didn't mention that book,
[02:58:10.380 --> 02:58:12.660]   but it may be "In Search of Miraculous"
[02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:13.740]   or "In Search for Miraculous"
[02:58:13.740 --> 02:58:16.060]   or whatever the English translation for that is.
[02:58:16.060 --> 02:58:18.980]   It's a good Russian book for everyone to read.
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:24.300]   - Yeah, I mean, if you put good vibes,
[02:58:24.300 --> 02:58:26.340]   if you put love out there in the world,
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:30.100]   miracles somehow happen.
[02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:33.060]   Yeah, I believe that too.
[02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:35.820]   Or at least I believe that, I don't know.
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:40.380]   Let me ask the most absurd, final, ridiculous question of,
[02:58:40.380 --> 02:58:42.700]   we talked about life a lot.
[02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:45.300]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:46.820]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:58:46.820 --> 02:58:52.300]   - I mean, my answer is probably gonna be pretty cheesy.
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:57.620]   But I think the state of love is once you feel it
[02:58:57.620 --> 02:59:01.460]   in a way that we discussed it before.
[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:03.700]   I'm not talking about falling in love, we're--
[02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:05.980]   - Just love.
[02:59:05.980 --> 02:59:10.460]   - To yourself, to other people, to something, to the world.
[02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:14.060]   That state of bliss that we experience sometimes,
[02:59:14.060 --> 02:59:16.300]   whether through connection with ourselves,
[02:59:16.300 --> 02:59:19.100]   with other people, with technology.
[02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:23.660]   There's something special about those moments.
[02:59:23.660 --> 02:59:30.420]   I would say, if anything, that's the only,
[02:59:30.420 --> 02:59:32.700]   if it's not for that, then for what else
[02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:35.700]   are we really trying to do that?
[02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:37.540]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it
[02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:39.100]   than talking about love.
[02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:44.040]   Eugenia, I told you offline that there's something about me
[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:48.180]   that felt like this was, talking to you,
[02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:52.220]   meeting you in person would be a turning point for my life.
[02:59:52.220 --> 02:59:55.140]   I know that might sound weird to hear,
[02:59:55.140 --> 02:59:58.780]   but it was a huge honor to talk to you.
[02:59:58.780 --> 03:00:00.980]   I hope we talk again.
[03:00:00.980 --> 03:00:02.260]   Thank you so much for your time.
[03:00:02.260 --> 03:00:03.580]   - Thank you so much, Alex.

[03:00:32.220 --> 03:00:33.740]   "The world is so exquisite,
[03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:35.900]   "with so much love and moral depth,
[03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:37.800]   "that there's no reason to deceive ourselves
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:41.260]   "with pretty stories of which there's little good evidence.
[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:43.400]   "Far better, it seems to me,
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:46.960]   "and our vulnerability is to look death in the eye
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:49.220]   "and to be grateful every day
[03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:52.100]   "for the brief but magnificent opportunity
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:53.560]   "that life provides."
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:57.680]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.

[03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:02.840]   (upbeat music)
