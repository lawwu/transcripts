[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to talk about the
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.320]   real estate market and the mortgage industry.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.640]   The bottom line is that the real estate market is hot, and the mortgage industry is doing
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.040]   very well.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.400]   Refinancing is through the roof.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.720]   Purchases, purchases look very strong.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.400]   If you look at the May mortgage purchase applications index, it closed at close to 11-year high.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   11-year high, because there's a lot of pent up demand after sheltering in place for so
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.800]   long.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120]   And I think this is interesting data, because this is what we've been talking about somewhere
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.720]   around the end of March and in April, looking for deals, trying to look for real estate
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.720]   deals because the stock market bottomed out at the end of March and started to recover.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.280]   So I was thinking to myself, well, let's go look for real estate deals from sellers who
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280]   are thinking the end is near.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.040]   And frankly right now, even in June, end of June, things are looking still very, very
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.520]   dicey.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.760]   But real estate tends to outperform when the stock market is down about 10-15%, because
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.440]   money flows into a more stable asset class such as real estate, and mortgage rates start
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   declining.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   And right now we're basically at all time lows, with a 10-year bond yield at about .7%.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.520]   The 15-year fixed rate is very low.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.440]   The average rate is around 2.5%.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.720]   If you want to refinance to a mortgage or get a new mortgage, a 15-year is not a bad
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   idea.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   It's probably a great idea.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.840]   Personally, I'm biased towards the 7-1 and the 10-1 arm, because the average ownership
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.680]   duration is about nine years in America.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.520]   So it makes no sense to get a 30-year fixed and pay a higher rate if you're going to pay
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.320]   it off or sell it or own the home for nine years.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.400]   So this demand, this surge in demand for real estate is very interesting.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.360]   It's because mortgage rates have hit all time lows.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   There's pent up demand, three to four months of demand for real estate, because not a lot
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.760]   of transactions happened at the end of March, April, May, and in June so far.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   Transactions are way down.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.520]   So that's not great for the real estate brokerage industry, because they make their money on
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   commissions.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.200]   However, from a buyer's point of view, I think there's an opportunity.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.320]   There's always an opportunity if you look hard enough.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.040]   And when there is a lot of fear and panic, there's opportunity if you have the cash and
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   you can get pre-qualified.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.080]   So the demand for real estate goes up also because there's a realization that having
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.720]   a home is more valuable, because more time is spent at home.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.480]   I realized this in 2012 when I left my day job.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.760]   So instead of being away from the home for 12 to 14 hours a day, I was suddenly stuck
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.320]   at home, well not stuck at home, just spending more time at home reading, writing, relaxing.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   So I was much more willing to spend money on remodeling, building out a deck, getting
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.240]   a hot tub.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.720]   I knew I would enjoy these things much more because I was simply home much longer.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.480]   And I think the world is recognizing this truth that the more you spend time at home,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.100]   the more valuable it gets.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.520]   And there's also this desire to have a nicer home, because we are spending more time at
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   home.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.880]   So in the past, maybe you were okay with renting a one bedroom apartment in a not so nice area,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.000]   a noisy area, because it was temporary.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.440]   And you were out for 14 hours a day, so all that noise and the smells and the crime didn't
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   really bother you.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.640]   But now that you're at home, hey, let's make it nicer.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.960]   Let's paint the walls.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.360]   Let's get that hot tub.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.260]   Let's get that $1,000 Toto washlet bidet, which heats the seat and shoots warm water
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.260]   at you.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.600]   I mean, that's wonderful if you're going to be going to the bathroom five more times,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.080]   10 more times a day, right?
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.520]   So it's just really logical that the demand for real estate has increased.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.780]   But before you buy a home, I think it's very, very important to understand what's going
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.320]   on in the mortgage industry, because the mortgage industry is very tight in terms of its lending
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.960]   standards right now.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.460]   And the reason why it's very tight is because it has liquidity and profitability concerns.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.360]   There's forbearance programs right now where people don't have to pay their mortgages,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.780]   people aren't paying their rents, so landlords have a difficult time paying their mortgage
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.780]   as well.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.980]   And so banks are being very cautious.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.100]   They went through 2008 and 2009.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.660]   A lot was learned.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.260]   And the lending standard dramatically increased post 2009, which is why I'm quite sanguine
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.800]   this time around that the housing market isn't going to implode, because a lot of people
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.020]   have a lot more equity piled up in their home, especially after a strong run since about
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.100]   2012.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.260]   But the mortgage industry is the key to keeping the housing market strong and upwards if you
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.660]   are bullish.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.860]   Because without that capital, the housing market is going to be really suspect, because
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.780]   there are so many people unemployed.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.020]   So the mortgage industry, the lending industry is really important.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.220]   And I talked to my lending officer for about an hour the other day, and I wanted to just
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.720]   share some key points with all of you.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.380]   So the first thing, like I said, was that there are liquidity or profitability concerns
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.780]   amongst all the banks.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.700]   They're wondering, OK, what can we do to protect profitability, improve shareholder value,
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.000]   and make sure everybody keeps their jobs in this uncertain time?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.660]   Because they don't know when the economy is going to come back.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.700]   They don't know when forbearance rules are going to be fixed or changed.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.180]   There's just a lot of uncertainty.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.240]   So the banks are doing the best they can for themselves and for their shareholders.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.680]   And at the same time, they're trying to be competitive, because inevitably, there will
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.940]   be a recovery.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   And consumers don't want to hear news headlines saying, this bank denied me of this mortgage
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.720]   because X, Y, and Z, especially in this environment.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   Because when there's a recovery, you could see banks who are uncompetitive during bad
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   times or unfeeling or uncaring will probably lose out on many, many customers to competing
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   banks.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.000]   So profitability, liquidity concerns, and social concerns, top of mind.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.900]   And so if you are a borrower, you're just going to have to find that lender who's going
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.720]   to be a little bit more aggressive during this uncertain time for that best loan.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.420]   The second point is obviously stricter lending standards.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.280]   Due to liquidity and profitability concerns, banks have significantly tightened lending
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   standards.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.320]   And here are some interesting points that you should know.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.640]   One, cash out refinances, that's going away.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.760]   At least this bank is not allowing cash out refinances anymore.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   Two, banks are no longer fully counting RSUs.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.840]   Those are restricted stock unit values when calculating how much a person can borrow.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.920]   So if those RSUs are not counted, then the person cannot borrow as much.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.880]   If you work at a tech company, for example, and you have $500,000 in RSUs that suddenly
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.960]   are not counted, well, you're definitely not going to be able to borrow as much.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.120]   Three, this is the most interesting thing that I got out of talking to my mortgage lender.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.280]   He said that his bank is no longer including Schedule E income.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   That's all the rental income you earn if you're a landlord.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.620]   So they're not including Schedule E income when calculating how much a person can borrow.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.280]   That is a big shocker, and I don't think I've ever heard of that before.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.040]   Because hey, look, if you're gaining $40,000 a year from your rental property, that's $40,000
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   a year.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.200]   Why would you discount that completely?
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.960]   Underwriters have traditionally discounted rental income by about 30%.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.100]   I know through all my previous refinances, they would only assign a 70% value to any
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.480]   rental income I had.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.540]   So $70,000 instead of, let's say, $100,000, because they wanted it to be conservative.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.400]   They wanted to account for vacancies and maintenance expenses and so forth.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.200]   And I understand that 70%, that's about right.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.960]   I guess I would probably do the same if I was a lender.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.000]   But to discount 100% of all rental income, that is pretty extreme.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.940]   So you can take this both ways, in a positive or negative way.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.080]   The positive is that there's so much demand for property right now with mortgage rates
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:27.100]   so low that despite not including Schedule E income, rental income, mortgages are still
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.300]   going through.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.500]   So when banks finally do allow for Schedule E income, which my mortgage loan officer said
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.940]   is coming over the next one or two months, it's kind of like rolling lockdowns, phase
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.560]   one, phase two, phase three.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.860]   Slowly getting released, it's getting a little bit better and looser.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.500]   That could very well unleash a lot more capital into the system.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:54.300]   On the negative side, I would just say that lenders are perhaps exacerbating the situation.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.200]   Unemployment, tough to get credit and all that.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.580]   And so there's going to be a bifurcation of who will get mortgages and who will not.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.760]   And then over the coming years, I think if things recover right, there's going to be
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.700]   a widening of the wealth gap spread once again.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.380]   All right, let's continue on other tightening lending standards.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.220]   This bank, it's a top five bank in the country.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.220]   Everybody's heard of it.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.580]   It's no longer approving home equity lines of credit.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.960]   They have raised the minimum down payment to 20% and they've raised the minimum credit
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.060]   score to qualify for a mortgage to 680.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.260]   And for the jumbo loans, I think they raised it to 740 and above.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.820]   So anything above 720, 740 is considered excellent credit.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.420]   So the bank is only lending to people with large down payments and excellent credit.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.620]   So again, this, if it continues, it could be good in terms of the people getting the
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.600]   loans, the capital are going to have a lower chance of defaulting.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.020]   Right now, the default rate, well, as of October 2019, the research that I saw was about 1.9%.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.540]   I think the default rate might be higher now, but I'm not so sure because the government
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.140]   has implemented, you know, you can't default because there's forbearance rules and you
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.780]   can't go bankrupt because of COVID-19 and all that stuff.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.820]   So everything is kind of suspended in air with a lot of uncertainty.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.060]   So the bottom line is lending standards are strict and everybody is feeling the crunch,
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.800]   including the banks, and they don't know exactly what the future holds.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.220]   In terms of jumbo loans, jumbo loans are loans that are above the conforming loan limit.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.660]   So nationwide, the conforming loan limit, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.900]   is $510,400.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:46.280]   However, in different states and cities, the conforming loan limit is different because
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.680]   housing prices cost more.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:55.100]   So in San Francisco, for example, the conforming loan limit is $765,600 for single family home
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.100]   or condo.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.180]   And it's different all throughout, but that is one of the top conforming loan limits in
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.180]   the country.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.660]   So it is much easier to get a conforming loan than a jumbo loan.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.620]   Conforming loans can be sold off to government-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.420]   So what happens is the bank gets the loan, they underwrite it, it's good to go, they
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.940]   sell it to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and offload that risk off their books so they
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.660]   can do more loans.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.180]   However, there's something really interesting that I heard from my mortgage loan officer
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.260]   and he said that there's new regulation that states if you sell a mortgage to Fannie Mae
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.860]   and if the borrower of that mortgage was late on even a single payment or is in forbearance,
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.780]   his bank would be required to not only buy back the entire mortgage but also pay an 11
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.780]   point penalty.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.540]   An 11 point penalty is 11%, folks.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:55.260]   So an 11 point penalty is equivalent to $77,000 penalty on a $700,000 loan.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.060]   And I have never heard of that before.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.340]   And whoa, no wonder if this is true, which it has to be true because he told me it's
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.820]   true that banks are being much, much more stringent.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.220]   And to clarify, these are for new loans.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.360]   These aren't the past loans.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.660]   These are new originated loans that they sell to Fannie or Freddie.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.820]   This rule isn't enforced.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.060]   So you can see from a lender's perspective how they are much, much more stringent because
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.100]   paying that 11% penalty is massive compared to the spread that they earn on these loans
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.700]   because the interest rates are so low.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.700]   11%, wow.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.140]   Jumbo loans cannot be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.300]   They can be sold and bundled to the private mortgage market, secondary market.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.980]   However, my lender was saying due to more regulations, his bank is keeping most of the
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.900]   jumbo loans on its book.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.940]   Therefore, they've got to be very, very stringent on their lending standards.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.020]   Another interesting thing I learned from my lender is that small business owners are getting
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.580]   more scrutinized and they seem to be getting more penalized than normal W-2 earners.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:06.020]   In other words, the PPP loan, the Paycheck Protection Program loan, could be a red flag.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:13.360]   He was saying that when the bank takes a look at a small business owner's books and does
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   the thorough P&L calculation and whatnot, if the bank sees a PPP loan, that could be
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.380]   a red flag regarding the viability of the business.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.100]   I think this is an interesting stance because you can also make the argument that a small
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.300]   business has a greater chance of surviving because it has received a PPP loan.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.020]   If the loan is forgivable, which the government says it is, why wouldn't more money be more
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.340]   beneficial to the business?
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:44.300]   But banks, again, really conservative right now, are just looking at everything and wondering,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.700]   "Hmm, maybe we shouldn't lend to a small business owner because it may never recover.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.700]   He may never recover."
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.740]   Whereas, in contrast, there continues to be only a routine concern about the W-2 employee
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.940]   loan applicant potentially losing his or her job.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.740]   But that is probably elevated too because there are tens of millions of people unemployed
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.740]   right now.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.420]   And if you are a small business owner or if you're thinking about creating a small business,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.500]   it is important.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.340]   It's important for you to make your business unshutdownable.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:22.060]   The government has forced shutdowns for three to four months of millions of small businesses
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.620]   because of the lockdowns.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.060]   So in other words, you should really think about a business that's online, that will
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.740]   go and operate regardless of whether there's a pandemic or whether there's a government
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   directive.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.740]   So long as you're not doing anything shady and wrong online, it can continue to operate
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.180]   and grow.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.840]   Not only should you have higher operating profit margins, the value of your online business
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.020]   should grow as well because the sustainability and the security of those future earnings
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.560]   and cash flow are stronger and higher.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.100]   So there's something interesting to note and something that I'm very appreciative about
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.260]   with Financial Samurai as I try to run it more like a small business now to take care
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.620]   of my family.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.220]   And that is, gosh, yeah, traffic could be down, revenues down or whatever.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.080]   But so long as Financial Samurai stays up, it's fine.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.620]   And I am, interestingly enough, fielding a lot more inquiries about buying Financial
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:22.900]   Samurai and I myself am looking for online businesses to buy because valuations are relatively
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.660]   low, especially compared to the S&P 500.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.620]   And these businesses are very, very defensible.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:34.020]   And I'm seeing a lot of online businesses do very well in this time because more dollars
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.380]   are directed for certain types of products like hot tubs, like home gardening and landscaping
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.460]   and so forth.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.780]   It's just a really, really interesting time right now.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.940]   So if you have some capital and you think the stock market is overvalued and maybe you
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.700]   don't want to invest in real estate property, I would look at online real estate.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.260]   Frankly, I've talked about this in the past.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.020]   You can check out my archives.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:02.060]   But online real estate to me is, I think it's number one asset class right now.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.860]   So let's put all this together regarding how a tighter mortgage industry will affect housing.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:14.780]   Well, it's logical to conclude that a tighter mortgage industry will negatively affect the
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.020]   housing market.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:22.340]   However, as I spoke earlier, there's an overwhelming amount of demand to purchase property due
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.060]   to confluence of all the reasons I stated in my introduction, right, lower mortgage
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.340]   rates, the desire for better property, because you're spending more time, the desire for
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.220]   investing in a more stable asset that you can actually enjoy, and so forth.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.900]   I say that the real estate segment that's doing the best is the price point where you
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.340]   can buy with a conforming loan.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.060]   So what is the conforming loan limit again?
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:57.020]   $510,400 nationwide up to $765,600 for expensive cities like San Francisco.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:04.140]   So assuming an 80% loan to value ratio, which is putting 20% down, there is a strength in
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.460]   the 638,000 to about 960,000 price point.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:15.880]   Obviously, if you put more down, you can still borrow a conforming loan limit.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:23.260]   So for example, a person can afford a $2.765 million home using a conforming loan if he
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:32.100]   or she puts down $2,010,000, right, so a 72.5% down payment with a loan to value ratio of
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.340]   about 28%.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.020]   Conforming loans are easier to get than jumbo loans.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:44.460]   Therefore, the housing price point that is going to do relatively well is where conforming
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.760]   loans are able to be used to buy this price point.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.120]   So the higher you go, the harder it is to get a loan, and once you get into the jumbo
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.220]   loan, this is where borrowing gets more difficult.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.940]   In other words, if you want to find a real estate deal, and if you can afford it, obviously
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.720]   if you can afford it, then you want to look at that price point where jumbo loans start
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.180]   getting into the equation.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:13.060]   And the higher the price point, the more deals will be had.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:19.360]   Because in this environment, extraneous stuff, vacation properties, mansions, whatever it
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.840]   is that you don't really need are probably going to be the weakest, because those are
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.220]   the types of property that will be sold off first, and those are the properties that are
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:35.080]   not going to be desired by people the most, because you don't need all that extra space,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.320]   nor do you want to spend as much money during this time of uncertainty.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.480]   It's really up to you to find that higher price point in your city where there are more
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.960]   deals to be had.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.680]   If you're looking for property deals near your city's median home price, let's say plus
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:56.080]   or minus 25%, maybe plus or minus 30 to 40%, it's tough right now, because a lot of people
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.600]   can afford that price point, which is why it's the median price point of your city.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.320]   To find value, you've got to go up the price point, which is going to entail obviously
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.600]   more risk and more expenses and more costs, but if you've got the cash and the income
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.040]   and so forth, you're going to find much better deals.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.800]   There's one last thing I want to leave you with, and that is this.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.640]   If you get pre-approved for a jumbo mortgage in this tight lending environment, you can
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.880]   pat yourself on the back.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.920]   Congratulations to you, it's not easy.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   However, you need to immediately turn that feeling of triumph into caution.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.800]   Caution, caution, caution when it comes to buying anything with debt.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.000]   Remember, leverage always enhances returns on the way up, but destroys returns on the
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.800]   way down.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.960]   Leverage is very dangerous, and right now is a time of uncertainty, so you probably
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.440]   don't want to take too much leverage.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.800]   Turn your feeling of triumph into caution.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.000]   Getting pre-approved for a mortgage today is like being a part of a small team of soldiers
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.040]   landing on the beaches of your enemy.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.000]   Just think about that a little bit.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.120]   The beaches are there, you can't see your enemy, but they're there in the hills behind
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.920]   the trees ready for you.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.340]   Your combat skills and artillery may be top-notch, but your enemy will still wipe you out simply
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.360]   because it outnumbers you 10 to 1.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.880]   In order to win the war, which is to have the property market go up, you would rather
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.080]   have 100 times more people on your side with fighter jets and warships as well.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.720]   Maybe this analogy is getting a little out of hand, but the point is you'd rather have
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.480]   everybody qualified for a mortgage instead of only a small few.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.440]   You don't want the small few to represent the whole.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.560]   Remember during the last downturn, let's say you owned a condo and you were diligent in
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.640]   paying your mortgage and everything was good, but a couple people in your building decided
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.080]   to foreclose or short sale or whatever because of whatever reason they want.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.480]   That negatively impacts everybody's valuations and that's really, really tough.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.300]   You can talk about the guy in your block, single family home, foreclosing and that hurting
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.440]   neighborhood property values as well.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.800]   It's the small few during a downturn that can really hurt the overall property market.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.720]   At the same time, it's the small few.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   If you can get a win, it's just not strong enough.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.200]   You need the masses, the majority, the vast majority to do well for the property market
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.880]   to do well.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:40.240]   Just because you've locked down an ultra low mortgage rate that's burning a desire in your
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.340]   heart to buy property, you shouldn't do it.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.720]   That's like the tail wagging the dog.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.400]   Instead, you should buy property if you've identified the ideal home, can afford the
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:55.240]   payments, have run various scenario analysis and plan to live or own the home for years
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.960]   and years to come.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.560]   The unemployment market is scary and I think the longer that it lasts, there's going to
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.620]   be a bigger and bigger fallout.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.680]   Right now, we're hoping for the good graces of the federal government and the federal
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.920]   reserve to save us, to save us from falling into the abyss.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.740]   There needs to be hopefully another round of PPP loans, for example.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.460]   There probably needs to be another round of stimulus checks and there needs to be an extension
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:27.400]   of enhanced unemployment benefits because fighting this virus is taking a long time
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.640]   and I don't know if we're going to be able to completely fight it off by July 31st when
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.340]   the enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 more a week are set to expire.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.920]   I'm always trying to throw caution in the wind, especially when it comes to buying property
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.080]   and getting into debt.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.120]   So just take it for what it is and run the numbers and be cautious.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.640]   My lender said the demand he is seeing for purchase applications is the strongest he's
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.940]   seen all year.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.380]   His business is booming because refinancing continues to be super strong as well.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.280]   I was able to lock in a 7-1 arm jumbo at 2.125%.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.460]   2.125% is ridiculous.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.200]   It is so cheap.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.280]   I just want to buy up everything that I can, but you know, I'm trying to be reserved and
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.840]   be measured because buying a home is a very big decision.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.680]   So please talk to your lender.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   Ask him or her what he or she is seeing in the market, what they are doing, when do they
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.160]   expect to return to its pre-pandemic lending standards.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.520]   I mean, pre-pandemic lending standards were already pretty strict, but now it's super
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   strict, right?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.180]   No Schedule E, no RSUs, credit scores high, down payments and so forth.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:47.480]   What you have to think about as a home investor and a home buyer is when the standards will
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   be loosened.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:54.340]   If it's by the end of the year and we expect the Federal Reserve and the Federal Government
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.880]   to have more stimulus, I think real estate is probably going to continue to do fine.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.800]   The desire for real estate, because we're spending more time in our homes, is overwhelming.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.060]   At this moment, the fear of losing your job and your income, and I think a lot of people
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.520]   are thinking, "Well, I can afford it right now because interest rates are so low, and
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   worst case, if I lose my job or whatever, I can hang out and hold out for one or two
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.480]   years while enjoying a nicer piece of property, and I want to live my life now."
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.880]   And this is something that I've been thinking about a lot that I'll talk about in the next
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:34.480]   episode or write about in a new post, and that is whether to stack cash and not utilize
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.040]   my hard-earned savings and earnings, or actually spend the money to try to make a better life.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.360]   And this is something that I think a lot of people are thinking about, and buying real
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.200]   estate is something where a lot of people think could help improve the quality of their
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   life.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.920]   And if the real estate market starts going down, and there's going to be more price cuts,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.400]   which there are at higher price points, and if the lending standards continue to be tight
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.480]   well into 2021 and so forth, then we should expect property prices to fade.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.720]   And that's not going to feel good if you buy the property, but at least you'll be able
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.280]   to enjoy your home, which is again what I think most people are thinking about right
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   now.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.480]   Let's buy a home to live a better life today because tomorrow is not guaranteed.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.840]   I would say this if you want to buy a property.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   One, you should try to get a discount of between 5 to 10% from pre-pandemic levels.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.120]   So February 2020, for example.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:40.000]   This 5 to 10% buffer is necessary, I think, just in case everything drags on for longer.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Second, I think you've got to promise yourself that you're going to own the property for
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.200]   at least 5 years, if not 10 years, because of transaction costs and so forth.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.080]   Those transaction costs really eat things up.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.200]   It's probably going to cost 5 or 6% to sell a property.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.240]   Hopefully not in 10 years as the internet reduces friction in selling costs.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.200]   But still, let's say it still costs 2 to 3%, you've got to hold on to that property for
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   a while.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:11.000]   Another criteria I urge you guys to follow if you want to buy a property is to not borrow
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   more than 3 times your annual household gross income.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.320]   So if your annual household gross income is $200,000, try not to borrow more than $600,000,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.200]   despite rates being so low.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.280]   Okay, fine.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:30.760]   If you really, really want to push that multiple as 5x, definitely don't borrow more than 5x
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.120]   your annual household income.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.160]   And it's gone to 5x because mortgage rates are so low right now.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   In the past when it cost 5%, 6% to get a mortgage, yeah, the 3x multiple is probably more appropriate.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.960]   But now I guess you can go to 5x, but I personally am not going more than 3x.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.280]   It is really interesting time to buy right now because there are no open houses.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   Open houses, I think that's one of the biggest contributor to bidding war because people
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.600]   see other people like it.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   And as soon as you see someone else like it, you start feeling this FOMO, this frenzy.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.080]   And that's what happens at least here in San Francisco.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:16.120]   I remember buying my property in 2000, I put an offer in end of 2004, early 2005, because
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.200]   I saw another couple sitting in the living room during the open house and I was thinking
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.720]   to myself, "No, you can't buy this house.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   This is my house.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   I got to buy it."
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.740]   So I ended up offering about $25,000 more than I wanted to, which in retrospect, fine.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.660]   It turned out okay because I sold it in 2017 for a good profit.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.280]   But not having to deal with the emotional buying aspect of it by seeing other people
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.400]   competing for a property you want is actually really powerful.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.540]   It's very powerful if you're a buyer right now because you can really get better deals.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.840]   You can offer more rational pricing.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.760]   I promise you this, folks, because I have seen private open houses, I've done like four
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.120]   or five over the past two months on properties I really, really like.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   And it's just a different feeling.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.400]   I'm just thinking to myself, "Much more rational.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.120]   I'm much more calm when I'm thinking about the numbers."
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.600]   And as a result, I'm going to be able to get a better deal.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.240]   So I think once open houses start becoming commonplace again, let's say everybody has
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.920]   to wear a mask and let's say it's only 10 at a time or five at a time, whatever, that
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.620]   emotional frenzy, folks, I promise you is going to come back.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.960]   And I think that could really ignite the housing market again, besides all the pent-up demand,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.440]   lower interest rates, and so forth.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   All right.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.980]   I'm rambling on a long time, but I'm very passionate about this.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.960]   And I really want you guys to get this right because a lot of us didn't get this right.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.880]   And I didn't get this right in 2007 when I bought my vacation property.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.200]   That was a terrible, terrible investment and idea.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.600]   You got to get this right.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.340]   Understand the mortgage market.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.440]   Do your best to understand the housing market.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.720]   Be rational.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.040]   If you have not found the ideal property, move on.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.200]   It's okay.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.320]   You deserve to buy the ideal property.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.420]   There's always going to be another one coming along.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.280]   So you just got to be patient.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   Be wise.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   All right, everyone.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.120]   If you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive review.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.360]   I'd love a share.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   Stay safe.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.920]   Let me know how your property hunting is going.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.720]   And let's all hope for the best.
