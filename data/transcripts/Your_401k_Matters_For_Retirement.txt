[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the 401k
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.360]   One leg of the three-legged stool for retirement in the past those three legs consisted of pension
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560]   Social security and personal savings now
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.580]   I believe there is a new three-legged retirement stool the three legs are one personal pre-tax savings
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040]   That's you
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.660]   To personal after-tax savings that's up to you and then three personal hustle and that's also up to you
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.700]   Social security it'll probably be there right just not in its current form and pensions just forget about it
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.400]   You've really got to depend on yourself to have that retirement that you've always dreamed of
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.840]   So with regards to the personal savings part the pre-tax savings part and the 401k good news
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.520]   It just got a little bit easier for everyone under 40 to become a 401k millionaire by the time you turn 60
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.300]   I strongly believe and I encourage all financial samurai listeners and readers to become 401k millionaires
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.260]   I know it'll happen if you continue to max out your 401k
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.080]   Every single year the maximum 401k contribution limit for 2020 goes up to nineteen thousand five hundred from nineteen thousand in
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.920]   2019
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.160]   According to the IRS. Meanwhile, the combined employer and employee contribution limit rises by a thousand to fifty seven thousand folks
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.000]   Fifty seven thousand that's a lot of money. In other words your employer in 2020 can contribute up to
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.840]   Thirty-seven thousand five hundred to your 401k in terms of a match or a profit share
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.240]   So when you hear you know an employer say they offer a three percent match or up to three thousand dollars
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960]   It's actually not so good
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.800]   They can do more but it's just they don't want to because look they're trying to make money as well
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Or maybe they're just not that profitable
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.300]   So for those of you who like to job hop every six months to a year
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.900]   I think that's pretty common among young folks nowadays who like to roll the dice with a startup
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.080]   Realize that you're potentially missing out on a lot of employer profit sharing or matching
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.280]   You know when I left my firm in 2012, I forsook twenty thousand plus a year in annual employer contributions
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.560]   So it's been over seven years now. Wow. I gave up a hundred forty thousand dollars, man
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.280]   I need to go back to work. So just kidding
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.560]   Well, actually maybe not and for participants ages 50 and over the additional catch-up contribution limit will rise to sixty five hundred
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.020]   That's up by another five hundred dollars
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.720]   Curiously the limit on annual contributions to an IRA for 2020 remains unchanged at six thousand dollars. What's up with that?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.000]   Government the additional catch-up contribution limit to an IRA for individuals age 50 and over remains
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.440]   $1,000 so according to Fidelity investments one of the largest administers of 401k plans in America
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.280]   Employees average 401k contribution rate is now 8.8 percent of their pay
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.720]   That's nearly a full percentage point higher than ten years ago. Wow
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.260]   one full percentage point higher in
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.500]   Contribution. All right, if we use the median household income of roughly sixty three thousand dollars in America that equates to about fifty five hundred
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.080]   Dollars an annual 401k contribution per household add on an average three percent salary match and we're talking another
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.580]   1900 employer 401k contribution for a total of about
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.500]   $7,400 so contributing between five thousand to eight thousand a year in household for one case not bad
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.460]   however, I
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.100]   Strongly encourage folks to force yourself to contribute the maximum amount allowed to your 401k each month
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.220]   You will learn to live on less or figure out new ways to make more money if necessary
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.620]   Always pay yourself first by at least
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.980]   Maxing out your 401k it should be a default automatic assumption
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.180]   So you can then aggressively build your critical after-tax retirement portfolio for passive income
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.000]   Ideally you want to accumulate an after-tax retirement portfolio
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.860]   That is at least three times your pre-tax retirement portfolio more and that retirement portfolio that pre-tax retirement portfolio
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.360]   Should be pretty good by the time you're 50
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.460]   I'm talking a base case of about a million dollars in your 401k plus IRA or
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.100]   750,000 by age 45 and as a result if you're gonna have three times the after-tax accounts
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.660]   Well, that's gonna be about 1.9 million at age 45 and 3 million at age 50. It does sound aggressive. I
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.940]   Understand that but if you can ultimately build a net worth
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.180]   Investable net worth of between 1.5 million to 4 million by the time you hit 50
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.620]   You should be good to go for the rest of your life
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.020]   The net worth spread accounts for varying costs of living and lifestyles, of course
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.300]   And of course, we've been through a 10 plus year bull market
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.860]   Who's to say we won't decline by 20% over the next two three years
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.700]   But chances are good over the next 20 years
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.540]   The markets are gonna be higher and if you're not regularly investing and saving you're gonna miss out
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.060]   Alright, let's say you're just
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.100]   Flabbergasted you're like there's no way I'm gonna be able to save that much money
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.080]   Well, if you compare yourself to the median and average person in America
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.820]   It's probably a legitimate concern by age 50. The median 401k balance is
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:34.340]   $63,000 and the average 401k balance is about a hundred eighty thousand dollars according to Fidelity by age 60
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.540]   The median 401k balance only increases by $300 to sixty three thousand and the average 401k balance increases
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.180]   by nineteen thousand five hundred to about two hundred thousand dollars as
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.700]   Of the second quarter of 2019 the overall average 401k balance is a hundred six thousand
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.100]   That's up 2% from a year ago
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.980]   Now why the median and average 401k balance hardly grows between the ages of 50 and 60. It's hard to say
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.660]   But I postulate that it's probably due to increased medical expenses and skyrocketing educational expenses
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.780]   Particularly college because when you're 50 to 60
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.860]   Okay, your your kids are college age and it's probably gonna put a dent in your retirement savings plans
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.900]   But there is some good news and it's good to know that
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.620]   Participants who have been in their 401k plan for 10 years straight the average balance reached
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.820]   305,900 dollars that's more than five times the average balance of fifty nine thousand nine hundred for this group ten years ago
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.340]   So what's the key?
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.900]   Longevity and consistency ten years of maxing out your 401k
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.460]   You are gonna be shocked and pleasantly surprised how much you will accumulate
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.180]   I promise you folks because it's not just the returns and you're maxing out if you have a decent company
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.100]   You're gonna get these matches too. And if you're at the company for ten years your profit sharing percentage is probably gonna go up as well
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.180]   But if we go back to the median and average balances
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.980]   Not so good. You don't want to be the median or average American
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:12.100]   Not only does the typical American have an underfunded retirement account, but the typical American is also quite unhealthy
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.180]   You can be broke and healthy. That's alright. A lot of young folks are broke and healthy. That's good
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.700]   Or you can be rich and unhealthy
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.940]   It's kind of stupid because if you're rich and you won the lottery you want to live as long as possible
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.460]   But you definitely don't want to be broke and unhealthy
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.700]   That's a bad combination that you've got to get out of you got to fix one or the other
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.660]   And I'm confident if you listen to financial samurai or read the post
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.340]   You should be able to fix at least your finances or make it better and with food and eating
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.820]   Well, we know it's just eating less and more exercise
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.540]   Finally, I just want to leave some historical perspective on what the historical 401k contribution limits were
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.660]   Because nineteen thousand five hundred is pretty darn good for 2020
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.900]   Back when I first started contributing to my 401k it was in 1999 and that limit was ten thousand
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.500]   So it's steadily increased by about five hundred dollar increments every one to two years
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.140]   sometimes a thousand dollar increments
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.180]   but it's generally been five hundred dollars and I
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.140]   expect this increase should continue as the government wants us all to keep up with inflation and
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.740]   Inflation is a dirty and a good word
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:31.220]   inflation helps those of us with assets get wealthier because our assets inflate with inflation and hopefully quicker and
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:38.300]   Those who don't have assets like real estate and stocks are going to get poorer because inflation is going to eat into your purchasing power
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.700]   So if you want to retire comfortably, please at least max out your 401k each year
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.980]   After ten years, you're gonna be pumped after 30 years
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.740]   I think you're gonna reach a million dollar status if you continue to max it out
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.980]   And that's fine work until 60 have your 401k have some of your social security
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.700]   Maybe you might have a pension you're gonna be okay
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.180]   You're gonna do great if you can max out your 401k and you know, it's not gonna be a lavish retirement lifestyle
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.460]   But it's gonna be a comfortable retirement lifestyle, especially if you pay off all your debt
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.340]   Now if you want to retire early like in your 40s or 50s
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.060]   You must really focus on building that after-tax
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:26.940]   Investment portfolio it can be in stocks bonds real estate private equity venture debt or whatever
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.180]   You just really need to focus on building this after-tax portfolio because it is this portfolio
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.720]   That's gonna spit out a livable passive income stream
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.100]   So hopefully after this podcast
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:45.620]   Everybody is motivated to max out their 401k and do some investigating on what other company benefits you have whether it's tuition
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.860]   Reimbursement benefits understand your health benefits because health care is very expensive if you don't have any benefits
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.060]   And I think you'll learn to appreciate your company more
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.540]   Look what type of profit sharing arrangement there could be if you stay at your firm for another three to five to ten years
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.860]   Who knows it could be really good
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.660]   Thanks so much everyone and happy savings. If you enjoyed this podcast, please share and subscribe
