[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.560]   All right, I think we have time for one more
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.960]   question about deep work.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.760]   And this one comes from Rachel.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   Rachel asks, hi, Cal.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240]   I'm an undergraduate student.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.120]   And I realized recently that I want
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.680]   to follow an academic career.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.560]   Do you have any tips for a novice researcher?
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   Which skills are the most important
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   in the academic field?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640]   Thanks.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.400]   Well, Rachel, as an undergraduate,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.280]   if you want an academic career-- and I'm
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.800]   assuming you're thinking about a traditional academic career,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.760]   a tenure-track job at a university,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760]   maybe a research-focused university,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.880]   the classical idea of what it's like to be a professor--
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.280]   by far, the most important thing you should think about right
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.880]   now is being the best student in your major, in your grade.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.640]   Being a star in your field is going
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.360]   to be your first step of many steps towards becoming
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.440]   a professor, a classical tenure-track professor.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   If you are one of the best students in your program,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.520]   in your grade, that is what's going to get you
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.240]   the type of recommendation letters that will put you
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.800]   into a top graduate program, because that's
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   going to be step two.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.560]   You want to get into the absolute best graduate program
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.120]   possible.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.640]   The academic market is incredibly competitive.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.600]   If you want a tenure-track job, you essentially
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.000]   need to be a star on the market, which
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.960]   means if you're not coming from a top school,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.480]   you're basically already out of luck.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.960]   So you have to be a star at your department as an undergrad
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.680]   to get the letters that get you into a school that gives you
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.400]   the chance of being a really strong grad student
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.600]   at a very strong program.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.980]   Once you're in grad school, that's
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.240]   where really the research is going to very much matter,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.560]   and you're going to have to pick up what is my specialty
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.800]   and pick up the skills, et cetera.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.200]   But let's put that aside for now.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.960]   So that's your goal number one, become a star in your field.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   How do you do it?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.080]   I used to write about this on my blog.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   Under schedule.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.720]   Now, it's very important for what you're trying to do
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.160]   to make sure that you have more than enough time
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.760]   for your major classes.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.560]   Don't double major.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   Don't triple major.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.400]   Don't do seven minors.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.540]   Don't join 19 clubs.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.560]   If you want to be an academic, there is no admissions officer
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.400]   in your future that's going to say,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.040]   I love the diverse amount of activities that this person did
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.700]   and they seem like a really hard worker.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.720]   They don't care.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.400]   If you're going to apply to grad school,
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.240]   the officer is looking at your application.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.320]   Is this person a star?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.760]   So get rid of all the other stuff.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.520]   Focus on your main major.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.760]   Make your schedule easy.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520]   So the courses outside of your majors,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   make sure that they're of a completely different character
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.720]   so you don't overload or burn out.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.480]   If you have credits that you can deploy here,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.680]   maybe AP credits, for example, that
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.320]   would allow you to essentially buy out of some classes,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   take a lighter than normal load some semesters, do that.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.800]   Maybe do an independent study.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.920]   Give yourself excess amounts of time for your classes
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.360]   so that you can get it done, then go back and look
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.480]   at your work, and then read some stuff on your own,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.760]   and just really be someone who stands out.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   That is the most important thing you can do.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.560]   Two, depending on the field you want
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280]   to go to graduate school for, some demonstration
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.440]   that you are capable of self-directed research
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   is important.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.120]   So get involved with undergraduate research
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.200]   with the best person you can in your department.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.240]   And this is not so much about the specific work
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.360]   I'm going to do is going to convince the grad school,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   like, oh, we want, in this case, Rachel
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.720]   to come do this same work.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.800]   It's showing them I was able to work with a professor.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.200]   They could give me things to do, and I did it.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.580]   You want one of your letters when you apply to grad school
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.280]   to say, Rachel worked with me on this project.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   This is an advanced project.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.660]   She was doing graduate-level work.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.540]   I could count on her.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.720]   She did high-quality work.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.760]   That's what they want to see.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.480]   And they want to see that you are a star.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   So those are my two main points of advice.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.040]   The third thing I would say is care about, of course,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.680]   your GREs if you're applying to a program where that matters.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.000]   When I was applying for computer science grad schools
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.160]   for the top schools that cared about GREs,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.360]   basically what we were told is you
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.880]   need very close to a perfect score on the math GRE.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.720]   Don't forget-- don't worry about the writing.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.920]   Don't worry about the verbal.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   But you need 7.7, 7.80, 7.90, preferably an 800 on the math.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.520]   That's just a cost of doing business.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.480]   So there's just a step of just doing that studying,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.900]   that familiarity with the GREs so you can hit those scores.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.240]   So become a star.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.280]   Do research, not to change the world,
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.160]   but to prove that you can take directions and are responsible.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.920]   And figure out what GRE score you
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.340]   need to get to the schools you want to get to.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.160]   Do those things, Rachel, and you're
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.600]   giving yourself the best possible chance of kicking off
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   an academic career.
