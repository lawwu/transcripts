[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.140]   They have two commands. One, obey your parents in the Lord.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.280]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.780]   Let's go together. Obedience is an action and honor is an attitude.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.960]   Teach your children the gospel. Who is God? Who is Christ?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.300]   What is sin? Teach them to repent.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.420]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.900]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.340]   Open your Bible to Ephesians 6.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.140]   Ephesians 6 and we come now to God's design for the family.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.560]   Now when we talk about the divine design for the family, it's really summed up in four verses.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.500]   They're really very simple and direct.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.220]   Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600]   Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   so that it may be well with you and that you may...
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140]   live long on the earth.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.300]   Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.140]   but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.380]   That is a minimalist approach to the family, and yet it covers everything.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.820]   There are plenty of places you can go and get bad advice about the family.
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.560]   This is the foundation of all God's...
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.400]   design for the family, directed at children and at parents.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   Now in order to successfully carry out the responsibility of raising children,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.680]   there are two duties here.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.920]   One on the part of the children, verses 1 to 3,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.380]   and then on the part of the parents in verse 4.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.620]   And as I said, there's so much more that can be said.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.360]   I'm just going to give you an overview with a few select emphases.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.560]   So let's look at verse 1, the duty of the children.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.860]   This is obviously children who are old enough to understand obedience
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.940]   and to take responsibility for acting in an obedient way
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.940]   and acting in honor of their parents.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.180]   So we're not talking here about infants.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.080]   Children is ta tekna.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.280]   There is a Greek word for infants that's not used here.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.820]   This is the word just generally,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.340]   the offspring, children.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.880]   It has reference to anyone from small children
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.420]   through young people before they start their own adult life.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.720]   Any who are still under the care of their parents,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.820]   all inclusive.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.360]   And they have two commands.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.640]   One, obey your parents in the Lord.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.400]   Obey, verse 2, honor your father and mother.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.020]   Obey and honor.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.920]   Those go together.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.100]   Obedience is an action and honor is an attitude.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.540]   The parent is in the position of the commander.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.160]   That is parental responsibility.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.800]   And children are to obey.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.940]   Now this is a challenging reality.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.080]   And there's a good summarization of the challenge of this in Luke chapter 2,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.720]   and it's related to our Lord.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.780]   Luke 2.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.580]   And verse 52 says concerning Jesus,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.280]   "He kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men."
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.860]   Now without sin, perfectly righteous, as a man, nonetheless,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.960]   he needed to increase in wisdom.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.660]   He needed to increase in stature.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.840]   He needed to increase in favor with God.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.720]   He needed to increase in favor with men.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.820]   He needed to increase in favor with God and to increase in favor with men.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.160]   Now these are the four categories in which children develop.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.800]   Wisdom is mental.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.760]   Stature is physical.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.540]   Favor with men is social.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.800]   And favor with God is spiritual.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.880]   Now our children are not perfect.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.680]   Our children are not righteous.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.080]   They are not sinless like the Son of God.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.640]   So we have to take on this reprobate that showed up
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.340]   disguised as a tender baby.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.280]   And we have to understand what we're dealing with.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.780]   They have to grow mentally, physically, socially, spiritually.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.660]   And we have to care for them in all four categories.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.060]   We teach them how to think.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.300]   We teach them how to work.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.960]   We teach them how to relate to people.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.240]   And we teach them how to relate to God.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.900]   We make a place for them in the world in this instruction.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.200]   This is our responsibility.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.000]   You have the responsibility to teach your children to be obedient.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.600]   That's also in Colossians 3:20, obedient because it's pleasing to the Lord.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.140]   This is what parenting is.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.940]   It's not developing their fashion sense.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.040]   It's not turning them into some kind of highly motivated
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.340]   scholar.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.940]   It's not making them into some kind of a great athlete.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.460]   It is to elevate them mentally, physically, socially,
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.300]   and spiritually by training them with the full faculties
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.100]   that you have, confronting the full faculties that they have.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.400]   And you are all those things.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.860]   You are mature physically.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.200]   You are mature mentally.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.160]   You are mature spiritually.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.860]   You are mature physically.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.860]   You are the model.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.860]   You are the example.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.860]   You get it.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.860]   You understand it.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.780]   And your job is to pass that on to your children.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.980]   And it starts with teaching them to obey, hupakouo, from which we get acoustic.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.840]   It starts with them listening.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.980]   Teach your children to listen and to submit to what you say.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.460]   It's a present imperative.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.680]   Keep on doing this.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.280]   Keep on obeying.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.560]   Obey your parents all the time in everything.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.180]   And then it adds, "In the Lord."
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.700]   In other words, because this is what pleases the Lord.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.700]   The same thing is said about submitting to the government in 1 Peter 2:13.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.300]   "Do it as unto the Lord."
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.100]   The same thing is said about slaves in Colossians 3 and their masters.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.100]   "Slaves, serve your masters in the Lord."
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.500]   This is because all of this is God's will.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.100]   This is God's design for the most productive life.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.640]   And you do it without any caveats.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.180]   You just obey all the time in the Lord.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.020]   Why?
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.580]   This is so good.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.580]   For this is right.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:49.920]   Can I stop here for a minute and say, your children need to know what's right.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.320]   That's the best answer you'll ever give your child
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.920]   when your child asks, "Why do I have to do that?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.420]   Why do I have to do this?
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.520]   Why don't I get to do this?"
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.360]   It's right or it's wrong.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.860]   That's all.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.860]   That's enough.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:14.600]   What you're doing is showing them that in the world in which they live, there are absolutes.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.620]   You don't need to give a philosophical defense of any behavior you require
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.140]   if it's consistent with the Word of God.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.840]   And having your children obey is consistent with the Word of God.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.880]   I remember my father saying to me many times when I said, "Why, Dad, why?"
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.120]   He said, "Because I'm in charge, because it's right.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.900]   It's right.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.100]   All you need to know is this is right."
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.960]   So the assumption then is that children are to obey their parents in the Lord because their parents are in the Lord.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:09:02.000]   You don't obey parents who are defying the commandments of Scripture.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.980]   So what is the child's responsibility?
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:15.520]   To obey because the parents are passing down the Lord's commands.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.080]   And then in verse 2, "Honor your father and mother."
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.780]   That is the attitude that corresponds
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.620]   to the act of obedience.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.060]   It's not reluctant.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.660]   It's not rebellious.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.560]   It's not unwilling.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.160]   It's with honor, tamao.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.040]   It actually can be used to mean awe or respect.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:51.600]   It's used in John 5:23 of honoring God and honoring Christ.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:57.440]   So this is how you obey, with honor.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.980]   This means the attitude and the action.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.460]   And then the apostle Paul says, "This is the first commandment with a promise."
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.880]   This is the fifth of the Ten Commandments.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:21.460]   But this is the first one with a promise because it's unique, and it's the first one in the human relationship section.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.020]   The first four commandments have to do with your relationship to God.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.400]   The last six commandments have to do with your relationship to each other.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   The first of those human relationship commandments has a promise.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.680]   And what is the promise?
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   Verse 3, "So that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth."
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.260]   That's quoted right out of Exodus 20:1.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.980]   Verse 12, the Ten Commandments.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:01.580]   That God wrote in stone on Mount Sinai.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:10.500]   It's absolutely essential that children both obey and honor their parents.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.800]   Absolutely essential.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.700]   Now, it's not natural.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.900]   It is not natural.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.140]   They are born reprobates.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.060]   They are born rebellious.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.900]   They are born with a fallen nature.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.400]   They have to be taught obedience and honor.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.460]   So what do you do?
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:35.040]   How do you train the child to obey and honor?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.980]   With discipline.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.040]   What does that discipline look like?
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.980]   It looks like telling them what is right and forcing them to conform to what is right,
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.880]   both in attitude and action, by discipline that is painful.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.260]   It's not sending your child to your room to think about something.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.280]   You don't want to prolong it.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.520]   A few whacks and it's over.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.260]   But they remember.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.060]   If you don't discipline your child, and by the way, this is where, again,
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.200]   you don't want to medicate a child because you never, ever get to the issue
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.640]   of being able to correct them in their worst moments.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.240]   Why do you do this?
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.720]   Verse 3, "Because you want it to be well with them
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.940]   and you want them to live long on the earth."
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.480]   Godly children will be living a blessed life.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.980]   That's quality.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.780]   And they will be living a long life.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.940]   That's quantity.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:39.460]   If you want your children to have a rich, full, joyous, happy, peaceful, rewarding life,
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.320]   then discipline them to obedience and honor.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.520]   And if you want them to live long, a long, full life, not short-cutting life,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:57.000]   but a life that is not haunted because of their sin and transgression
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.100]   and lack of self-control, then you discipline them.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:10.480]   And we see that explicitly then in verse 4, don't we?
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.280]   "The parents, what is your job?
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.340]   Do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.340]   in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   This is the duty of the parents.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:30.220]   It is essential to raise a child with truth and discipline, truth and discipline,
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:38.720]   so that the promise of a blessed life may become a reality, truth and discipline,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:47.660]   so that the sins of the fathers aren't passed on to corrupt the subsequent generations.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.160]   And he gives you two positive, or two positive,
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.760]   approaches, one positive and one negative.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.200]   The first is negative, but let's look at the word "fathers."
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.340]   That's patera in the Greek, and it can be fathers as it's translated.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.440]   But it also can mean parents.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.880]   The same exact word is used in Hebrews 11:23 to speak of the parents of Moses.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.040]   So I think we can embrace parents in this.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.360]   Parents, here's the negative, do not provoke your children to anger.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.980]   Don't make your children mad.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.980]   Don't make them angry.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.680]   That's an abuse.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.660]   That's a terrible thing to do to a child, make a child angry.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.360]   How do you make your child angry?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.400]   Well, you know the ways you can do that.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:49.800]   But let me remind you, you can make a child angry by overprotection, by fencing them in, confining them,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:15:01.780]   distrusting them, never allowing them any freedom so that the relationship becomes a kind of bondage that is irritating.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:08.320]   You can make them angry by favoritism.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.260]   Why don't you act like your sister?
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.660]   Don't compare them with each other to defend a preference.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.620]   You can make them angry by unrealistic
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   expectations.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.620]   This is huge.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.300]   Don't crush them under the weight of your own pride and ambition, because you want somebody
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:35.700]   to know that you have a scholar for a child or a great musician for a child or a good athlete for a child.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:42.580]   You set standards so high that they never feel like they can ever attain it, and that turns into deep bitterness
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.040]   and feelings of failure and rejection.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.440]   You can cause your child to be angry by discouragement,
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.720]   by negative reinforcement, no thanks, no rewards, no approval, no honor.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.420]   It destroys motivation.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.120]   Make them feel like they have to earn your love.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.960]   It's a terrible thing.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.260]   You're supposed to love with grace like God loves you.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.860]   You can make a child angry by selfishness, failing to sacrifice for them.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:19.260]   Children can become bitter when they feel like they're an intrusion into your life or a bother to your parents.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.240]   You need to help them, serve them, do the things that communicate sacrificial love.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:33.840]   You can make a child angry through impatience, failure to allow for childish behavior, for mistakes, for foolish things,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.540]   for spilling things, breaking things, sharing ridiculous ideas and desires.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.360]   Don't condemn them.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.560]   Don't be impatient in their development.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.080]   You can irritate them.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:58.160]   You can irritate and make your children angry by neglect, so much of that.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.000]   Mother not in the home, father's not in the home.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   Neglect turns to bitterness and anger.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:17.900]   And you can do that by verbal abuse, failure to restrain your very advanced vocabulary, which you use to crush a child with sarcasm,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   ridicule, cutting, swearing,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.700]   name-calling, whatever.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.500]   If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condemn.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.320]   If a child lives with hostility, he learns to fight.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.320]   If a child lives with ridicule, he learns to be shy.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.480]   If a child lives with shame, he learns to feel guilty.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.860]   If a child lives with tolerance, he learns to be patient.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.820]   If a child lives with encouragement, he learns to have confidence.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.720]   If a child lives with praise, he learns to be patient.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.820]   If a child lives with love, he learns to appreciate.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.220]   If a child lives with fairness, he learns justice.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.860]   If a child lives with security, he learns to trust.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.400]   If a child lives with approval, he learns to like himself.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:10.640]   If a child lives with acceptance and friendship, he learns to love.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:18.540]   So this is the challenge that parents have.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.380]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.540]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.120]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.260]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.520]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.560]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.440]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.360]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.460]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.460]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.460]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.480]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.380]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.180]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.280]   If a child lives with a sense of self-worth, he learns to be patient.
