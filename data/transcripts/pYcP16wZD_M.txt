[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.120]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the fourth chapter, reading from verse 27 to verse 30.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.400]   Verse 27 to verse 30, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.160]   And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.240]   But no man said, What seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her?
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.360]   The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.200]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.840]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.240]   Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.920]   I want in particular to deal with the twenty-ninth verse.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.160]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.800]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.240]   Now these, as you recall, are the words spoken by the woman of Samaria.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.400]   She hurried back to the town in which she lived, and invited the men who lived there
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   to come out, and to see this strange and wonderful person whom she had just met herself, the
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.760]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.760]   Now we are looking at this incident with a very definite object and purpose in view,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.920]   and that is not merely to consider the history.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   We are looking at it as indeed we are looking at the whole of this Gospel according to St.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.520]   John, from the standpoint of discovering how it is that we can avail ourselves of all that
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   is offered us in this glorious, marvellous Gospel.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.760]   That is the whole point of this Gospel, as it is of the other Gospels.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   It is the whole point of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.320]   Now John makes this especially his great theme.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.760]   He has said in the first chapter that as many as believed in the Lord Jesus Christ have
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.960]   the right or the authority to become the sons of God.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.400]   And he has said, "Of his fullness of all we received, and grace upon grace."
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.280]   Now that is what we are concerned about, for that is Christianity.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.680]   That is the only Christianity.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.320]   There is much that passes as Christianity, which patently is not that at all.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.640]   As you look at it and know it and compare it and contrast it with what you find in the
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.280]   New Testament, you see at a glance that it is something quite different.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.200]   It is religion, but it is not Christianity.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.520]   And therefore our great endeavour should be this, to know and to be certain that we have
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.400]   received and are receiving of his fullness, and grace upon grace.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Not that we had something once, and that we have just gone on with that ever since.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   No, grace upon grace, a development, a growth.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.520]   Now this is the great theme of this epistle.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.560]   "I am come," says our Lord, "that they might have life, and that they might have
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.360]   it more abundantly."
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.480]   This is the essence of true Christianity.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.880]   Now it is obvious as we examine ourselves that there are obvious hindrances and obstacles
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840]   to our obtaining this.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.920]   Are we rejoicing in this or are we not?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.960]   That is the question.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.600]   And what we are trying to do is to discover some of these hindrances and obstacles and
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.680]   to see how they are to be dealt with.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.520]   And there is very rich teaching about that in the whole of this Gospel.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.400]   And we have seen that there is tremendous teaching about this in this one incident of
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   this woman of Samaria.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.080]   It is a wonderful story, isn't it, how a woman like this, of all women, should end
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.840]   face to face with the glorious truth of the Son of God, the Saviour of the world.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   So there is every encouragement to us.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.600]   We meet together to find out the way positively, to remove the hindrances and the obstacles,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.920]   to see what it is that is robbing us of all that God has purposed and planned for us in
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.240]   the Son of His love.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   Now we saw last Sunday morning as we resumed these studies that we have got to start always
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.960]   with the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.840]   If we don't do that we are inevitably doomed to go wrong, because everything is in him.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.320]   In other words, we must cease to think of it as but some teaching which we dare up and
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   apply.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.560]   No, it is essentially a personal relationship to him, and a personal communion with him,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.800]   and a receiving of him.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.840]   Now he, as I say, he is everything, and that is why John puts it like that in that sixteenth
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.320]   verse of the first chapter, "It is of his fullness that we have all received, and grace
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   upon grace."
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.240]   Or as the Apostle Paul likes to put it, he likes to compare the Christian Church to a
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.640]   body, and we individually are members of this body which is the body of Christ.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.880]   And he is the head, and we all receive from that head, the fullness is in him.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.800]   He is the fullness that filleth all and in all, in the Church, says the Apostle.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.400]   He is the head over all, and all comes from him.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.360]   It is all derived from him.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.280]   Or again, as he puts it, you remember in a very pregnant statement in the Epistle to
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   the Colossians.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.920]   He is always concerned about this.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.040]   This is the great theme of all the epistles in a sense.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.960]   He says, "I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at Laodicea,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.760]   and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh."
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   What is he concerned about?
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.320]   "Well, that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.480]   riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:16.960]   and of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   That's it.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.440]   "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the body of Godhead Babylon."
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.160]   And you, he says, are complete in him.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   So we've got to start with him, and we did so last Sunday morning.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.880]   Well now then, the great question is, as I say, have we received of this fullness?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.520]   If not, why are we lacking?
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.040]   What's the matter?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   What's the obstacle?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   What's the hindrance?
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   It's all there.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.000]   Now everything that the greatest saints that the Church has ever known was all derived
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.120]   from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.640]   The saints were not what they were because of some natural powers and faculties.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.480]   That comes in in ministry and so on, but in and of itself, in the life they had, in the
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.720]   experiences they had, it was nothing in them.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.800]   Because you read about them before their conversion, before they were born again, and you see that
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.480]   they were failures like everybody else in spite of their shining gifts.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.760]   No, the whole secret was that they were in this communion and fellowship with him and
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.840]   they were receiving this fullness from him.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.040]   So what was possible to them is possible to us.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   And therefore, the first thing we have to do is to discover the blockages, the hindrances,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:45.080]   the obstacles that are preventing our experiencing all this fullness that is there.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.600]   And now we will find that we are given much further instruction as we examine the case
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.080]   of this woman of Samaria.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   We've already seen many of them, but here there is a new one and there is a fresh one.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.760]   And I find it in this statement that she made to the people of her city.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.680]   "Come," she said, "see a man which told me all things that ever I did."
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.120]   Now that's the thing that she says first about him.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.200]   And what I want to direct your attention to is just that very thing, and to ask a question.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.920]   Why did she say that?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.840]   Why was that the particular way in which she issued her invitation to them to come and
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   see the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.960]   Why didn't she talk about his personality?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.400]   Why didn't she describe his physical appearance?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.760]   Why didn't he say some of these wonderful things that he taught her about worship and
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   things like that?
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.680]   No, the thing that she singles out is this.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.080]   "Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did."
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   What is this?
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.160]   Well, this is what we call conviction of sin.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.080]   And what I want to try to show you this morning is the primacy of this.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.480]   That unless we are clear about this, it's not surprising that we know nothing else.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.840]   There are certain rules in this spiritual life, and they're rules that have got to
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   be observed.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.920]   There are no shortcuts in the spiritual realm.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.440]   There are certain things that are absolutes, and unless we conform to them, we shall never
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   know much about this fullness that is in him.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.280]   And so, you see, the first thing is conviction of sin.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.920]   "A man that told me all things that ever I did."
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   This is the thing that is uppermost and most prominent in our mind.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:51.280]   Now you notice that there is on the surface what appears to be an element of exaggeration
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.800]   in what this woman said.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.480]   She says, "He's told me all things that ever I did."
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   That's hyperbole.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.360]   It's not a lie, it's hyperbole.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.240]   What our Lord had actually told her, of course, was that he knew all about the immoral life
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.880]   she was living, and the fact that she had had five husbands and that the man she was
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   now living with was not her husband.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.760]   That's all he actually said about her life.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.080]   But she says, "He's told me all things that ever I did."
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   Which means this, that as our Lord revealed to her his knowledge of her present life and
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.440]   what she was actually guilty of at the moment and had been guilty of in the recent past,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   he made her feel that he knew everything.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.560]   And her past life rolls up before her.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   And though our Lord hasn't put it into words, he's produced it, he's resurrected it, and
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.240]   as it were, she saw on a screen, flashing past her eye, the whole of her life and all
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   her misdeeds and sins.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:59.920]   Now, this is something you will find not at all infrequently in the testimonies that many
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.280]   saints of God have left before them.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:08.440]   Some people have testified to this kind of thing when their conversion has been due to
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.640]   some crisis or some accident.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   I've read of men, I remember one in particular, who was converted as the result of a terrible
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.200]   accident, an explosion in a mine.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.780]   He suddenly heard the noise and he saw a flash, and he realized that his end may be at hand,
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.960]   and he testified that immediately there passed before him the whole of his life, as it were,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   and individual misdeeds.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.840]   Now, it's difficult to understand this, isn't it?
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.040]   It's difficult for us to accept that.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.200]   And yet we know that even in the natural realm, this whole problem of time is a very strange
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.920]   one, and there can be a foreshortening which we don't understand.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   This kind of thing happens.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   We are so ignorant, we think so much in terms of clocks and watches and seconds and minutes
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.000]   and hours, but there is this extraordinary capacity of seeing a whole, as it were, in
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.720]   a flash.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.680]   And when you bring in the spiritual, this of course is still easier to understand and
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.120]   to comprehend, and there is no doubt at all that that is precisely what happened in the
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.920]   case of this woman.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.900]   He only mentions one thing, but that brings it all up.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.240]   And she is face to face with herself and of life and of misdeeds.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.440]   So she says, and says quite truly, therefore, "See a man which told me all things that ever
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.120]   I did."
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   You can tell he told her these things not in words, but in this other way as well.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.160]   So her statement is one that we can easily understand.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.320]   And therefore this is the thing that is clear, that the thing that this woman was most conscious
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.000]   of was conviction of sin.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.880]   And it is in terms of this that she invites her fellow townspeople to come and see our
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Lord.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.460]   Well now, this to me is the most important matter.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.480]   If I were asked to say what in my opinion is most lacking in the life of the Christian
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.320]   Church at the present time, without any hesitation, I should answer that it is just this.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:21.760]   This is the thing that is most lacking, conviction of sin.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.200]   A sense of our unworthiness and a sense of the glory of God.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   We are too healthy.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   We are too satisfied.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.280]   We are too pleased with ourselves.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   We are not sufficiently humble.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.480]   And therefore if we are to know individual revival or general revival, we've got to
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.080]   start with this.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.280]   This is one of these absolute rules, I say in connection with the whole of our spiritual
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   life.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.760]   When you contrast the state of the Church today with what you can read of in past ages,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.000]   and I should refer to this God willing, this is the thing that strikes one immediately.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.080]   There's an absence of humility, an absence of repentance, an absence of this sense of
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   unworthiness.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.440]   And this of course is vital.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.840]   Take it, let me give you one example of how this kind of thing works out.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.880]   Here it is, Harvest Thanksgiving.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.360]   Is the world interested in Harvest Thanksgiving?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.680]   Why doesn't the world thank God?
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.280]   Why don't we all always realize our indebtedness to God?
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:39.640]   Now you know the answer of the New Testament to that is that it is all due to the fact
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.680]   that we have never realized the truth about ourselves and the truth about God.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.360]   Now this is the great argument of the Apostle Paul in the second half of the first chapter
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.520]   of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.480]   He says, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.440]   of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.920]   Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has showed it unto
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   them.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.800]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.080]   by the things that are made, even his eternal power are guarded, so that they are without
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.720]   excuse, because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.400]   but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.520]   Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.440]   God into an image made like to corruptible men, and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   creeping things, etc."
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:49.480]   Now all that just means this, that the world doesn't realize the truth about creation
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.720]   and about daily life and living, and the very means whereby we go on living.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.320]   The world doesn't realize this.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   Why?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.120]   Well, because of its ungodliness and its unrighteousness.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:10.840]   In other words, you'll never persuade men to realize the truth about creation, nor about
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.720]   their daily life and living, until they're in the right relationship to God, until they're
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.840]   godly, until they're righteous.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.400]   In other words, they need to be convicted of their sin, they need to repent, they need
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   to turn to God.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.760]   It is then and only then that they shall be able to see things truly.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   Now this is the most important point, because there are those who think that you can persuade
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.560]   men and women about these things by sheer argumentation.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.840]   The answer is you can't.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:48.760]   No man can even see the universe and creation truly, unless he has new life in him.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.920]   The natural man is incapable of this.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.280]   He sees the creature rather than the Creator.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.000]   "A primrose by a river's brim, a yellow primrose was to him, and it was nothing more."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.680]   That's all he sees.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.320]   He can't see anything more.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:15.480]   But a man with a new nature and a mind illuminated by the Holy Spirit, he sees God in the flower.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.680]   "A primrose by a river's brim, the meanest flower that blooms."
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.360]   All these things, he sees them, but he sees them because of what's happened to him.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   And you can only see creation and all things as you have this mind, this eye of Christ.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.200]   So you see, these things all hang together, and it's exactly the same about receiving
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.880]   of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.560]   The last people to receive this fullness, always, are the people who think they're
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   already full.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.080]   You don't seek for fullness if you think you've got it.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.000]   That would be foolish, wouldn't it?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   And so, you see, it is the people who have never gone down who never go up.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.800]   It is the people who have never realized their emptiness, their woe, who never know very
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.640]   much about the fullness and the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.280]   Very well, so you see, this thing is something that must come first.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.080]   The primary thing is conviction of sin.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.400]   Now, I want to show you how it is our failure to put this in the first position that accounts
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.720]   for so many of our troubles, and certainly accounts for the poverty of our Christian
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   lives.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   Why must this be put first?
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.840]   Well, here is an answer.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.280]   The great difference in the last analysis between the cults and the Christian faith
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.320]   and the Christian teaching and the Christian life is just this very thing.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.520]   Has that ever occurred to you?
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.760]   Now, it's no use denying that the cults can help people.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   They do.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.480]   They wouldn't succeed but for that.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.400]   The cults obviously do things for people, hence their followers.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.720]   Look at Christian science and things like that.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   Look at their buildings.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   They've got wealth.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   That's because of the numbers of their adherents.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.320]   Listen to their testimonies.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   Yes, the cults can do many things to many people, but there is one thing a cult never
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   does.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   It never produces in anybody a sense of guilt.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.160]   And of course, that is a part of their popularity.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.520]   The cults, you see, always come to you and more or less tell you that you're really
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.640]   all right as you are, that circumstances are people or something, and that all you need
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   is a bit of help.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.520]   They're most ingratiating and they're most pleasant.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.640]   They never disturb you.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.200]   They never make you feel uneasy.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.000]   You never come under any sense of conviction.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.440]   They never make you feel that you don't deserve any blessing.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.080]   No, no, they tell you, you deserve everything and you can get everything.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.040]   They're so pleasant, pleasing, everything you want, here it is.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:03.200]   But you see, that's where they differ so essentially from this Christian message.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.680]   That's what makes this so absolutely unique.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.000]   And the trouble is that so many people approach the Christian faith as if it were but one
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.240]   in series with the cults.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.680]   And they come expecting that kind of thing, but they don't get it.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   Why not?
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Well, because this is different.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   They say, "I came for comfort and I came for help, but you made me feel uncomfortable
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   and I don't like this."
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   Well, exactly.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.120]   But you'll never know this blessing until you have been made to feel uncomfortable.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.640]   And of course, it's not only true of the difference between the cults and the Christian
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:40.240]   faith, it is equally true of the difference between all psychological treatments and all
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.840]   psychological movements and the Christian faith.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.320]   Now, this has got to be emphasized again, because there are people who turn this faith
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.520]   into a psychological method of treatment.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   You're familiar with this.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.360]   There have been men who have been well known in what are called Christian pulpits, who
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.480]   have been doing nothing but treating people psychologically.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.680]   There are men flourishing at the present time.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.720]   They talk about the power of positive thinking, as if that were the Christian message.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's pure psychology, nothing else at all.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Psychology using Christian terms and Christian terminology.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.360]   How do you tell the difference?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.800]   What right have I to say that that is not Christianity?
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.560]   It's not even a pseudo-Christianity.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.440]   It is a travesty of Christianity.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.760]   What right have I to say that?
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   Well, I say it purely and solely on the strength of this one particular test.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.960]   All that psychological misuse of the Scriptures never produces the conviction of sin.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:51.360]   Indeed, you will find that the purveyors of those false teachings generally denounce the
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.720]   biblical doctrine of sin.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.440]   They are the very people who talk about that God sitting on the top of Mount Sinai, whom
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   they don't believe in.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.400]   "Ah," they say, "we don't believe in that God of the Old Testament, the God of
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.760]   Law, the God of Wrath."
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   They dislike that.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   They say that's a travesty.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   They don't accept.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.960]   They believe in the God of Jesus, they say, who is nothing but love.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.560]   Now that's their way, you see, of putting their whole case.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.080]   And so they go on and say that nothing has done so much harm to people as the preaching
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.680]   of a doctrine of sin and bringing people under conviction.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.240]   They say you've created complexes in them.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.640]   You've made them lose confidence in themselves.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   You've kept them down.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   But it's wrong.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.200]   It's a perversion, they say.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.600]   The first thing you've got to do is to get rid of this whole notion of sin, which has
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.760]   so depressed people and stood between them and the enjoyment of all they say they've
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.200]   got to offer.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.280]   But thereby they betray themselves completely.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.880]   Nobody who has gone to them can come back and say, "Come, come to me to see a man
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.560]   who's told me all things that ever I did."
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   Never.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.600]   Because they never produce that effect.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.380]   They never make us feel worse than we were.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.440]   They never make us feel hopeless.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.520]   Now my dear friends, you see the vital importance of all this.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:21.080]   If the Christian message has never made you feel worse than you were before you first
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.200]   heard it, you've never really heard it.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:30.640]   If it's never made you feel hopeless, you don't know it.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.520]   This is the very essence of the Christian religion, Christian faith.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.320]   And of course this is something that one can illustrate so easily and in so many different
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.240]   ways.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.200]   You remember what the ancient Simeon said about our blessed Lord when he held him as
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.440]   an infant in his arms.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:00.720]   "This child," he said, "is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel."
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.880]   You notice the order?
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   The fall.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.720]   There's no rising without going down.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.920]   There is no salvation without preliminary condemnation.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.120]   And this is the uniqueness of this message.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.680]   People come to it as if they were coming to the cults, I say.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.280]   They want this, that, and the other.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.480]   And at first they're shocked, and it means that at least they should be if they're truly
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   hearing the gospel.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   They always will be.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.160]   But they say this, "I've got my problems, but now I'm made to feel that I'm wrong, that
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.640]   I'm a worm, that I'm less than a worm."
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   And they dislike this exactly.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.800]   But this is always what our Lord does.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.440]   Well now, you see, you've got it all, haven't you, in this case of the woman of Samaria.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.760]   We saw how this woman with her glib, clever argumentation was very ready to argue about
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.640]   this well, and was ready to argue about worship this mountain, Jerusalem.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.040]   Oh, how easy it is.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:58.120]   But then our Lord becomes personal, puts his finger on the running sore of her life, reveals
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.240]   to her an utter sinfulness and wrongness.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:08.640]   And that was essential before she could ever be led to this great and glorious salvation.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.480]   Very well, then, I say, this is the great difference between the cults, which of course
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:22.920]   are nothing but psychology, or even a more explicit teaching of psychology in terms of
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.320]   the Christian terminology and the Christian faith itself.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   But secondly, this is the crucial point of difference between taking up religion and
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.000]   becoming truly Christian.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.280]   Now here again is a most important distinction.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.080]   You know, my friends, it's possible for us to take up religion.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   It is possible for us to take up what we regard as Christianity.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   And there are many who do that, many who have done that.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   God forbid that there should be any such in this congregation this morning.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.600]   I say there is a vital, essential difference between that and truly becoming Christian.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.080]   What am I talking about when I'm talking about this?
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.800]   It is possible for a man, a natural man, to be interested in Christ.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.720]   There are many such.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.600]   They're interested in this person.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.440]   After all, he's a phenomenon of history.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.440]   He's a remarkable person.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.080]   You see, when you've been brought up under thought always in terms of evolution and a
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   gradual development and progress, suddenly you find two thousand years ago, very nearly,
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:43.600]   this towering figure, not a man who's merely interested in history and in the processes
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.920]   of thought and in philosophy.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.360]   You're bound to meet him and to confront him, and many have been fascinated by him.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.040]   Interest in the person, and then interest in his teaching.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.600]   People who are concerned about the state of the world, and having tried so many things,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:06.000]   they say, you know, what you rarely need is the application of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   There are still many such people.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.760]   There used to be many more in the early years of this present century.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.000]   This was the prevailing teaching, the social application of the Gospel.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.240]   And they rarely believed that you could turn the Sermon on the Mount into acts of Parliament
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.920]   and thereby put your world right.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.120]   Interest in the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.880]   That can be taken up.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.120]   Not only that, there are many who desire to live a better life, who desire to live a good
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   life.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.920]   You see, every sinner is not as bad as he can possibly be.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.840]   There are great differences among sinners.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:50.720]   Some poor sinners are just wallowing in the mire and the filth of the gutters of life.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.160]   But you know, there are others who are equally sinners, and who are no more Christian than
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:00.640]   the men in the gutter, who are very concerned about living a good life and are very anxious
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   to live a good life.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   There is idealism and there are idealists.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.680]   There are large numbers of these people.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.240]   And they generally want to live a better life themselves, and they want to really, to be
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   good.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   They're troubled.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   They've got consciences.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   Every man's got a conscience.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.640]   And some people's consciences are more sensitive than others.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.720]   And some who've taken the trouble to read, and who are concerned about the whole problem
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.560]   of men and of life in this world, they've read about the ethical, moral systems.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   They've read not only the Greek philosophers, they've read the mexings of Marcus Aurelius
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.640]   and these various idealistic accounts of life, and their whole desire is to be able to live
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.240]   that sort of life.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.080]   So they take this up.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.560]   And there are others who desire to do good.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.560]   The world has large numbers of people who want to do good.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.720]   You see, we mustn't, ever, as Christians, say that nobody wants to do any good in this
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.000]   world but the Christian.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.360]   It's not so.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   These people who are anxious to do good and to improve the world, to put an end to war
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.960]   and do this, that, and the other, there they are.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   And they feel that, well, this can help them to do that.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.440]   So they take it up.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.120]   Our Lord is to them the great pacifist.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.920]   And the Sermon on the Mount, they say, teaches that war is always wrong and sinful.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.480]   So they like it.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.040]   And now they're out to do good and to uplift the human race.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:36.240]   And they take up religion, they take up the Bible, they take up what they regard as Christianity
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   in order to do good in this way.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   And then, perhaps at the top of the list, we've got the people whose great ambition
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.440]   and desire in life is to imitate Christ.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:55.160]   It's most fascinating to trace this history in the long story of the Christian Church.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:02.220]   And this has been one of the greatest snares for many an honest soul seeking salvation,
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.920]   the imitation of Christ.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.080]   Now, it sounds so good, doesn't it?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.240]   You see, obviously these people are anxious to be good and to be better.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   They're anxious to do good.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.880]   They say, "Now then, here is one who's lived a perfect life in this world.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.000]   That's what I must emulate.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.980]   I must go after him, I must follow him."
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.160]   So they set out and they'll find books and manuals to encourage them in the imitation
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   of Christ.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.280]   And they're ready to make sacrifices.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.960]   Again, we must be very careful how we speak.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.560]   There are people in the world this morning who quite genuinely and honestly and sincerely
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.800]   have set out to imitate Christ.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.600]   They've given up good posts and prospects in the world.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.240]   They've made great financial and other sacrifices and they're out to imitate him.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.440]   And this is regarded as the height of Christianity, the Christian profession.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.360]   We don't hear so much about this as we used to, because the two wars have shattered it,
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   of course.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.080]   But still, there is a lot of this unconsciously in the world today.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.880]   I remember very well, I mention it simply as a typical illustration of what I'm saying.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:13.240]   I remember attending a meeting for young people less than forty years ago, a special young
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.560]   people's rally.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.480]   Three speakers and they'd been given the same subject.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:31.440]   The appeal of Christ to the enthusiasm and heroism of young people.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.200]   You see the idea?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:40.880]   He was to be depicted as a young man, full of heroism, full of enthusiasm, full of idealism.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.400]   Here's the one for you to follow.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.600]   Now this is the way to win young people.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.560]   This is the way to get over them.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.840]   They've got it in them, you see.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.480]   Young people have got heroism, all of this.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.040]   Young people are enthusiastic.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.520]   Young people always want to do good.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   They want to follow Christ.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.720]   Here he is, let's hold him before them and he'll appeal to them.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.400]   All this that's so wonderful in them.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.200]   Now there it is.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.400]   But you see how it all betrays itself.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:16.080]   All their teaching, all this interest in the person of our Lord, in his teaching, in the
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.680]   desire to be good and better, to improve the world and to imitate him, it is all based
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.280]   on one assumption, and that is that virtually we're all right as we are and we've got
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.840]   it in us to be like him.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.480]   So all we need to do is to be roused, to be enthused, to rise up and follow him in this
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.840]   great crusade.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.640]   But it's never made us feel uncomfortable, has it?
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.760]   Indeed it's done the very opposite.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   It's made us feel we're rather wonderful.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   We can do this.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.480]   And indeed there's something good in me or I wouldn't be responding to this.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.720]   You see the person who's come under these kind of influences, he doesn't rush back
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.880]   and say, "Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did."
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   No, no.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:11.200]   "Come see a man who's told me that I've got it in me to live as he lived, that I can put
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.880]   the world right, that all we need is to bend together and to march down this highway and
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.560]   the world will become paradise."
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.840]   We've got it in us.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   Believe in yourselves.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   Follow him.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.200]   He is what you can be.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.900]   You see, that's religion.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.420]   And you can take up that kind of thing.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.240]   And there are thousands who've taken it up.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.920]   And unless, isn't this one of the great problems of the Church today, that this is what it
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.200]   regards as Christianity.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.920]   It's just calling upon people to enter into this, to take it up, to go and have some great
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.720]   crusade to do this very thing.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.920]   And the world can be invited, of course.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.960]   We want them to see this.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:59.920]   So you denounce the biblical doctrine of sin and you appeal to people in terms of the idealism
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.200]   of Christ, and the wonderful teaching and the possibilities that he's held out before
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   you.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   He'll rouse them in you.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.760]   But you see, he doesn't do that.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.080]   What he does is to expose you to yourself, to make you see yourself as you really are.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   And it's horrible.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:20.520]   And you feel you're unworthy to do anything.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:27.840]   Now, here is obviously, therefore, something that we've got to be very clear about.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.760]   It's not surprising that people say they've tried Christianity and have found it wanting,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   or that they're disappointed with it.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.560]   It's not surprising.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.360]   You see, they've started with the wrong conception.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.640]   This is a message that first and foremost convicts us of sin.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:48.160]   Well, let me show you this by putting it like this.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.840]   The New Testament teaching makes it perfectly plain and clear that it is indeed impossible
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.000]   for us to be truly Christian without this.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.960]   How does it show this?
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.320]   Well, the first way I would put it is this, that this is the thing that always comes first
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.760]   in the New Testament itself and its teaching.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   It gives it priority.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.200]   If you just take your New Testament, let's assume now that we don't believe this message
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.280]   at all, but that we come as literary critics, and we're going to make an analysis of the
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   New Testament.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:31.960]   And we are given this question, "What is the first teaching in the New Testament?"
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   And I think you'll all have to agree that it is this.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.720]   It is always a message of repentance.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.360]   Look at it in terms of the preachers.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.800]   Who is the first preacher in the New Testament?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.040]   The answer is John the Baptist.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.480]   We are told about his birth in that wonderful way.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.760]   And then he sets out on his ministry.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   This is the introduction.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.400]   This is the prologue.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   What did he preach about?
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.920]   Well, there's no difficulty about this, is there?
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.760]   He preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.560]   Now you see, there had been that 400 years of silence, as it were, after the time of
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.920]   the prophet Malachi, not a word.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   Then suddenly a phenomenon.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.640]   A strange man preaching in a wilderness, clothed, camel hair, shirt, leather girdle about his
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.120]   loins, eating locusts and wild honey.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.080]   Strange man with an extraordinary message.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   What did he preach about?
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:38.040]   Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.320]   And they come crowding out to listen to him, the Pharisees included.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.200]   And this is the reception he gave them.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.360]   He didn't say, "I'm glad to see you.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.280]   Are you ready to go forward in this great crusade?
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.440]   I'm starting to put the world right."
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:56.920]   No, he looked at them and he said, "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:02.520]   Begin not to say amongst yourselves, "We have Abram to our father, for I say unto you that
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.440]   God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.120]   Don't make any mistake about this, says John.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.640]   The axe is laid to the root of the trees.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:19.960]   Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.280]   Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.600]   The first message of the first preacher.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.000]   "I indeed baptize you with water."
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.680]   Well there it is.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.120]   Nobody can dispute that.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.000]   The second great preacher of course is none other than our Lord himself.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   What did he preach about?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.720]   Well you know it's exactly the same thing.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.880]   If you read the Gospel according to Saint Mark which summarizes these things, this is
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.840]   what you read in verses 14 and 15 of the first chapter.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.520]   Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.440]   the kingdom of God and saying, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   hand.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:08.000]   Repent ye and believe the gospel."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   You see it is precisely the same thing.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.360]   Well now we've already seen in the previous chapter in his teaching a man like Nicodemus,
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.960]   teacher of his master of Israel, a teacher, a good man, a religious man, a moral man who
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   wants to be arguing on equal terms as it were and is ready to receive a little further information.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.600]   What our Lord said to him was this, "Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:36.440]   of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.560]   Born of water, that's repentance again, that's baptism again, that's acknowledgement and
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.760]   confession of utter sinfulness.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.320]   You see to a man like Nicodemus, who wants to start from where he is and go on, no, no,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.680]   down, start again, you must be born again, you must go through the water, you must be
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.520]   baptized, this is it.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:08.600]   This is repentance and indeed it is everywhere, explicitly in all his teaching.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:17.080]   You remember how he was constantly making this point, especially to the Pharisees?
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:22.360]   You remember he spoke a parable one afternoon and here it is, what thinking?
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.880]   A certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said, "Son, go work today in
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   my vineyard."
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.600]   And he answered and said, "I will not."
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.960]   But afterward he repented and went.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   And he came to the second and said likewise, and he answered and said, "I go, sir," and
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   went not.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.760]   "Whether of them twain did the will of his father, they say unto him, the first, Jesus
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.040]   saith unto them, verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.520]   kingdom of God before you.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.560]   For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and he believed not.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.320]   But the publicans and the harlots believed him.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.280]   And he, when he had seen it, repented not afterward, that he might believe him."
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.760]   You see, this is the thing that determines our entry into the kingdom of God.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.520]   You cannot enter the kingdom of God without repentance.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.680]   It doesn't matter what you are, however good you are, the publicans and harlots will go
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   in before you.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   Why?
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   Because they repented.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.320]   It's the very essence of his teaching.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.120]   You get exactly the same thing in the famous parable about the publican and the sinner
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.760]   that went up into the temple to pray.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.440]   What could be plainer and clearer?
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:42.040]   You see, here's a man who people seem to think would please our Lord.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.440]   They both go up to the same temple.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.880]   Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a publican.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.640]   The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.560]   men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.840]   I fast twice in the week.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   I give tithes of all that I possess."
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.000]   Here's the typical follower of Christ.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.800]   Here's the man who's taken up Christ.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.160]   No, you see, but it's all wrong.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:13.760]   The publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   smote upon his breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.320]   I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other, "For everyone
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.800]   that exalteth himself shall be abased; he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   Now there it is quite clearly, I say, in his teaching, but it's implicit in the whole
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   of his teaching.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:42.760]   Look at this sermon on the mount, which this kind of person we are dealing with seems to
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.840]   admire always, and is ready to take up and to put into practice and to follow Christ,
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.680]   and to imitate his example, and to say, "This is what the world needs, is the application
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   of this."
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:01.960]   What a travesty, what a complete misunderstanding of the sermon on the mount and its purpose.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.360]   What is the sermon on the mount?
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:11.440]   Well, the sermon on the mount is nothing but an exposition of the law.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.920]   The Lord did not preach the sermon on the mount because he thought men as they were
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.240]   could keep it.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.680]   It was the exact opposite.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.600]   It was to convict men who thought they could keep the law of God that they could never
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   do so.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.120]   He says, "The moment you really understand the law, you will see how impossible it is.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.400]   You take the instances.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.760]   The man you see who says he's never committed murder."
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.960]   But says our Lord, "Have you understood that?
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.440]   You say, 'Because I never murdered a man, I've kept the law in this respect.'
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   But have you?" he says.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:48.360]   "Have you ever said about your brother, 'Thou fool, have you ever murdered him in
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.120]   your heart and in your mind?'
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.600]   If you have, you're guilty of murder."
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   Now, does that mean to say that the sermon on the mount is possible?
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   No, no.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   It means that it's impossible.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   Is the law possible?
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.840]   It is impossible.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.880]   The law is concerned about my motives, my desires, my hidden imaginations, and therefore
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.040]   the moment I see it, I'm undone.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.120]   The sermon on the mount was to convict men of their utter helplessness, and that he had
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.440]   come to save them out of their helpless and their hopeless position.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.880]   And it's the same with the whole of his teaching.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:31.280]   He all along shows men that they cannot save themselves.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:38.240]   With men, he says, it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.800]   That's the reply to the question of who then can be saved.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:48.240]   Now, now, as Simeon prophesied of him, he cast down, he condemned.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.800]   That's what the Pharisees hated him.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.360]   But it is invariable.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:58.720]   And here we see him doing it, as I say, with this woman of Samaria.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.840]   He cuts across all the talk and the pleasant argument, and immediately comes down to this
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.720]   question of sin and guilt, conviction of sin.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.240]   And as this is true of the teaching of our Lord, you will find that it is equally true
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.800]   of the teaching of the apostles.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.560]   You turn to the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and there you will find this theme at the
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.560]   very beginning and running right through.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.080]   Here is Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost, filled with the Spirit.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.800]   And what he's doing is to expound the Old Testament scriptures, as you remember.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:39.320]   He quotes them, and makes the point of the resurrection, and shows that this is what
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.160]   was prophesied of the Messiah when he came.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:48.440]   That David is still, his body still lying in the sepulcher where he was buried, he hasn't
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   risen.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.800]   And he goes expounding these scriptures, and points out how God has at last sent the
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.440]   Deliverer, and the Holy Ghost which has come upon them is the absolute proof of this.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.240]   Therefore he says, "Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:12.040]   same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:19.680]   Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.600]   the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:30.480]   Here's the first effect of the preaching of the gospel, the announcement, the proclamation
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.720]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.440]   The effect it has is, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:42.160]   Then Peter answered and said, "Repent, repent, acknowledge, confess your sin.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.240]   You felt a pricking in your hearts, you're aware of your guilt, it's been exposed to
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.520]   you for the first time, acknowledge it, give up defense.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:56.400]   Cast yourself at his feet, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.680]   for remission of sins."
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:04.000]   That's Peter, first preacher amongst the apostles, and then look at the apostle Paul
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.920]   with his mighty ministry.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   What did he preach?
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   I mustn't keep you.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   Listen to this as I close.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.040]   There he is in Athens.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.960]   What does he preach in Athens to this cultured, sophisticated society, to this gathering of
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.000]   stoics and epicureans?
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   This is the message.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.520]   "Whom ye ignorantly worship him, declare I unto you.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.760]   God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is the Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   dwelleth not in temples made with hens, neither is worship with men's hens.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.640]   As though he needed anything seen, he giveth to all life and breath and all things, and
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.240]   doth made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of all the earth,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.080]   and doth determine the times before appointed in the bounds of their habitation that they
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.480]   should seek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him and find him.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:58.360]   For he is not far from every one of us, for in him we live and move and have our being,
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:05.800]   as certain of your poets have also said, for we are also his offspring, and on he goes."
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:11.880]   And he says, "For as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   of the Godhead that is likened to gold or silver or stone, graven by art and men's
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.000]   device, and the times of this ignorance God winked at.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.520]   But now commandeth all men everywhere to repent."
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:35.800]   For philosophers, idealists, repent is the universal message.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.920]   And finally, he takes his farewell of the elders of the church at Ephesus, and this
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   is what he says.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   "When they were come to him, he said unto them, 'You know from the first day that
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.480]   I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.360]   Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befell me by
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.680]   the laying in wait of the Jews, and how I kept nothing back from that was profitable
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.760]   unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house, testifying
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:15.920]   both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   Christ.'"
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:23.320]   My dear friends, we've got to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.440]   But if you merely take the New Testament teaching chronologically, in the order of priorities,
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.760]   there is no question this is the first message.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   It starts with this.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:38.960]   "Come, see a man that has told me all things that ever I did, a man who has made me see
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:46.640]   myself as I am, my guilt, my emptiness, my woe, my helplessness, my hopelessness."
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.080]   That is always the first effect that he has.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.760]   Has he had this upon us?
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:03.040]   There is no hope of receiving of his fullness and grace upon grace until you've known conviction
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:12.480]   of sin and have realized your appalling need and your precarious position.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.760]   Have you known this?
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:21.960]   Start with this because without this, he has nothing to give you.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.240]   But having had this, he has everything to give you.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   Start at the beginning.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.320]   Make certain that you've done so.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.520]   Amen.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
