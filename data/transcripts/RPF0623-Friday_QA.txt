[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Okay. So I don't know. I'm not familiar with the laws of Bermuda. But I would encourage you to investigate that and it's hard for me to think that there wouldn't be by the time by the time you have there wouldn't be a way for you to start beyond that process towards citizenship in Bermuda. Your fastest options then would be but you cannot just because you're living in Bermuda doesn't mean you can't also start the process of citizenship in Bermuda.

[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.060]   Okay. So, for just the reason I pointed out is there may be ways if you wanted to, if you wanted to be a citizen in the United States,

Now, these rules have changed. There are a number of countries in the world that are well known for the fact that you can go there. You can apply to be a resident of that country. You can get a resident visa and you can start the clock ticking towards a status of citizenship. There are only a couple of those out there and I would refer you to your own research.

[00:51:53.220 --> 00:52:21.360]   We would like one day to own land and live off of it as much as possible within reason. We're planning on a minimum of 20 acres. We also want to own rental property.

In your opinion, should we pay the minimum on everything and stack cash until we can afford the down payment on the property we want and then save for the building of our dream home on it? Or should we pay off all of our debt with gazelle intensity? Or should we start with a rental property? And I would like to hear your thoughts on that.

[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.460]   Britton, who has earned income,
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.540]   so he qualifies for a Roth IRA,
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.780]   so he has earned income,
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.860]   but he's not contributing to a Roth IRA,
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.620]   you could go and give him $6,000 and say,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.720]   hey, put this in a Roth IRA
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.360]   and make my daughter the beneficiary.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.960]   The problem is once you give him that money,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.260]   you can't force him to put it into the Roth IRA,
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.980]   nor do you have any legal control over the money whatsoever.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.560]   He could take it and run,
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.540]   and he would be entirely within his legal right to do so.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.820]   Now, it would obviously spoil Thanksgiving Day,

[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   It's perfectly fine if your daughter is receiving birthday money for her one-year birthday or two-year birthday.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   It's perfectly fine to put those dollar bills in an envelope and stick them under the mattress.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   It's also perfectly fine for you to simply open a bank account and put it in for her.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   Not everything has to be done in an account.

[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:12.700]   I'm not going to put much money in a 529 plan where it becomes "worth it". So, free yourself from those constraints. Look at your daughter and just think, "What do I think would be in the best interest of my daughter?" Based upon our situation, what would be the best way for me to invest in my daughter? How can I do that? How can I invest it in her now?
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   It's
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   a
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   way to
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   find
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.460]   a

[01:13:42.480 --> 01:14:11.920]  obedience. If you don't have a solution, what you're doing is you're not doing it right. You're not investing in your daughter. If that doesn't work, hire grandma. Hire a family member, a trusted family member, so that she can be in that family environment instead of in an institutional environment. That will pay off much bigger dividends than being institutionalized at an early age. Go down the list. Meet her educational needs. Hiredagain, I don't need to repeat. So,
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.400]   it's

[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.060]   I have no very little pride these days in carrying a U.S. American passport. So I share your emotions on the subject. But a couple of things for you to consider that I hope will be encouraging.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.060]   I'm not sure if you're aware of the issue. And I think that the difference, if you were to go back to 1973, Roe v. Wade, the difference between then and now is a difference of clarification. Where back in 1970, you could say, "Well, we don't know much what happens in the womb." Or, "We don't know much about a baby until it comes out." No one can say that today. And so whether you look at it from a scientific perspective or from a philosophical perspective, the issues are being clarified. Even the latest kerfuffle with the debate over the birth of a baby.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.320]   "The debate was always, 'Oh, abortion.' Something magical happens when the baby comes through the birth canal. And it's been remarkable to me this week to see how even the question of infanticide has come up into the debate. Now, I don't yet see people publicly debating whether or not we should engage with the baby. But I think that the question of infanticide is a very important. And I think that the question of infanticide is a very important. And I think that the question of the birth canal is a very important. And I think that the question of the baby is a very important. And I think that the question of the baby is a very important. And I think that the question of the baby is a very much.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:21.360]   Now, I don't yet see people publicly debating whether or not we should engage in infanticide. But I do think that's the debate that's going to be necessary. The best philosopher on this subject is the philosopher Peter Singer, who is a secular philosopher and professor at, I can't remember where he's a professor now, I think Northwestern University, something like that. But he's a professor. And he's a prominent secular ethicist. And basically, he wrote a great book, or at least a great book, called The

[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's very hard.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's very hard.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's very hard for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's very hard for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   Most people feel the peer pressure to say, well, no abortion, no big thing, just a clump of cells, nobody cares. But you're a mother, Chloe, you know that that's not the case. You know it's not possible. It's not possible to be a mother and not recognize just the life that's in your heart.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's very hard for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion. You know it's not possible to be a mother and not recognize just the life that's in your heart.

[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   The point is, I found mothers who are very diligent.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   They find mothers, they interact with them, they reach out to them, they call them, they help them if they need resources, if they're poor, if they don't have money, they work with them, but they don't hold back and they confront the mothers directly.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   They don't always save the babies, but they have saved dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of babies.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   So there's something that you could do.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   Look for a mother who is willing to help you.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   It's very hard for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion. You know it's not possible to be a mother and not recognize just the life that's in your heart.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   It's very hard for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion. You know it's not possible to be a mother and not recognize just the life that's in your heart.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:28.800]  , and I think that's really effective.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   If you're able, I think there's a place for you to go and advocate with mothers in person.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   There's a man in Orlando, John somebody or other, but I searched out his story and I wanted to go and interview him and find out, but he's an older man. I think he's a retired pastor and for the last, forgive me if I'm botching the details, basically for more than a decade, he goes to one of the abortion mills in Orlando every day and he intercedes with the mothers who are coming from the U.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   and he intercedes with the mothers who are coming from the U.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   and he's a mother who's coming from the U.
