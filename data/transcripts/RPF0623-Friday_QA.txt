[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   When you're in winter's favorite town,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   the snow-covered mountains surround you,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   a historic main street charms you,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and every day brings a new adventure.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Welcome to Park City, Utah. Naturally, winter's favorite town.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [sigh]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's live Q&A.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   [music]
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and making a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, I am your host,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and it is Friday, which means today, live Q&A.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   These calls are open to patrons at the show, if you'd like to become a patron.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I was going to say go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron, but that link doesn't work.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Go to Patreon, look up Radical Personal Finance, you'll find me.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   [music]
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   In the next couple of days, there are a lot of links that aren't working,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   so I'll have to arrange a complete and total reorganization of the website. There's more coming on that in the future.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But I guess what I should rather say is these shows are usually reserved for patrons,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   but I am actually going to be hosting a couple of public shows this next week.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So if you're listening to this show and you would like to join me, please join me
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   this coming week for a Q&A call recording on Monday,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   February 4, 2019.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Monday, February 4, 2019. Tuesday, February 5, 2019.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And Wednesday, February 6, 2019.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   At 1 o'clock p.m. Eastern Time for a call.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   If you would like to join a call like this, and the way that you join is on the phone at
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   561-440-7462.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Again, that number is 561-440-7362.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Look at the written notes on your phone.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   561-440-7362 if you'd like to join for one of those calls.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm recording again another series here of live Q&A calls. I would love to speak with you.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Today, though, we first go to Taylor in South Carolina.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Taylor, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hey, Joshua. Thanks for doing these calls.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm listening to all your Life Insurance podcasts. I kind of want to give you a summary
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   of where I'm at now and see if you have any recommended next steps to take.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm recently married.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Probably this next year, we're going to try to get pregnant.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   The plan is I will be a stay-at-home dad.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'd like to be at home as much as I can, but I'm a chief physician
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and want to get back into that work. I want to see
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   what life insurance you might have to recommend.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I've listened to all your shows, and I know a lot of different things. I probably want to start out with
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   a term, but I want to see if you have any recommendations.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   How old are you and how old is your wife?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   We're both 29.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The place to start is always fairly simple. With life insurance, the rule is this.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You always solve death benefit need first with term life insurance.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You calculate how much life insurance you need,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and then you make sure that you purchase that amount of life insurance with term life insurance.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's the simplest place to start.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Term life insurance is going to be your cheapest way to own lots of death benefit.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   In your initial stages of life insurance planning, you are concerned with death benefit.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   How do we protect one another in case we die?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You solve death benefit need that's temporary with term life insurance.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Once you have term life insurance and you have it locked in,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   then you can go on and try to figure out, do we want anything else? Do we need anything else?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Figure out if some variation of a permanent life insurance product
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   is helpful to you at all. But you always start with term life insurance because that gives you
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   the maximum bang for the buck.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm going to start with.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I guess maybe I'm feeling a little financial.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   About 500 grand net worth right now. I'm pretty heavy in cash right now.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I've heard a little bit about this infinite banking, bank on yourself.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That sounds interesting. It's a little confusing to me,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   but I know I'll just start with term life, but I'm curious to see
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   where I might investigate next.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   If you are interested in a concept like the infinite banking concept,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   which basically involves the use of large overfunded cash value life insurance policies
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   to provide you with a safe place to store money
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and a source of personal financing for the expenses of your life,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   then what you'll do in your strategic planning is you will make sure
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   that strategically you purchase your life insurance policies, your term life insurance
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   with a company that will have the type of permanent life insurance product
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   that will fit your personal infinite banking goals.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's where you start.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   If you're going to use company XYZ, and that's the company that your infinite banking consultant
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   is going to recommend for you, then you just simply make sure
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   you purchase your term life insurance in that scenario with that same company.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   What I would recommend, what I always recommend to young people, and by young people
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I mean anybody under the age of about 45,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   excuse me, anyone under the age of 40s, especially people who are in your
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   phase of life where you are looking forward to the arrival of children, but you
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   don't currently have those children,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   you want to have the most flexible term life insurance that you can. That flexibility is going to
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   come by purchasing a type of term life insurance that's called annual renewable
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   term life insurance versus level term life insurance.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Most people recommend level term life insurance, which has its place
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and it's especially fine for people who are a little bit down the life cycle, but in
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   your case, with just purchasing life insurance, you would want to start with
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   annual renewable term, because that will give you a very long period
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   of convertibility where you can convert your term life insurance to permanent life insurance
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   products.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Any other questions? Do you want to go further with anything or is that enough
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to get you started? I think that's enough for now. Thank you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Okay, very good. We go on now to
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Justin in Colorado. Justin, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Hey, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I had two questions. I think they'll both be relatively quick.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The first one is I was interested in your perspective. I think it's
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   technically possible, but I wanted to kick the tires on it with you.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I have a certain amount of money in a traditional IRA.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I would like to make a backdoor Roth contribution
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   this year as well, and I'd like to do so without
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   being subject to the pro rata rule and having to pay
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   income on some portion of that. My question is, if I roll that IRA into
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   my 401(k) and then subsequently
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   do a backdoor Roth conversion, does that seem like a reasonable way to
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   avoid the pro rata rule? Do you have any wrinkles with that?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I can't, off the top of my head,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   without having the details on the pro rata rule, I can't summon
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   that data up. Explain to me the rule and explain to me how your plan
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   avoids that, please.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   My understanding of this is probably somewhat tenuous.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   My understanding is if I make a contribution into my traditional IRA
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   with the intent of rolling that into a Roth IRA
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   afterwards, say I have $5,000 in my traditional IRA
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   currently, and then I make another $5,000 contribution, and then I roll that
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   $5,000 into the Roth, my understanding is I'd have to pay income on 50%
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   of that, I'd basically pay a fee or income on
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   50% of that. I'd have to essentially realize $5,000
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   as income in order to do that conversion. So my question is
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   if I, previous to making that contribution, if I roll the entire contents of my
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   traditional IRA into my 401k, and then
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   at that point I would have a zero balance in my traditional IRA, and then at that point I could
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   do a backdoor conversion and there would be no balance to contend with the pro rata rule.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I don't know if that approach made sense to you.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Short answer is I'm not entirely sure.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I would need to sit down, chart this out on paper
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and study through the rules, and I am not current
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   on those rules in order to answer that off the cuff like this.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But I can tell you how to approach it. If you
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   look at the rules and you can arrange your accounts in such a way that your
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   accounts are not in violation of the rules, then yes, your plan will
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   work. And so what I would just simply do is if you've read through
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   the rules and said, "Okay, if I put all of this account here, so therefore
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I don't have the other account outstanding, then that means I only have this
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   one account," yeah, go for it. Realistically,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   as long as you can check that box based upon your reading of those
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   rules and you have found your workaround through
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   reading those rules, check the box, move on with it, and
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   you'll be fine. Good chance as long as you can make sure that the custodians
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   who are involved in the recharacterizations of money aren't
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   reporting something that would cause you to be subject to those pro rata
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   rules. Chances of you facing a problem, as long as
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   things aren't reported, chances of you facing an IRS audit or a problem there are very, very low.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   If you can satisfy the letter of the law in
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   the maneuvers that you've accomplished there, then
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   legally you're in good shape. And so I don't see any problem with
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it. As long as the plan that you've described follows the rules, then
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   you'll be in good shape. And hey, if you're not, then maybe we can name a new rule
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and a new tax case after you. It could be the Justin
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   modification of pro rata rules for backdoor Roth IRAs.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That's certainly something I'd prefer to avoid, all
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   things being equal. Agreed. Go with your second question, please. I'm sorry, I didn't know
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   the answer specifically to that one. No, no, no, that's fine. It's kind of a complicated
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   deal. So just a kind of a quick follow up. Do you know
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   off the top kind of where you would go to view those rules? I'm not a tax
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   expert. It just seemed to me like a workaround. So start with a web search, obviously.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I would go to DuckDuckGo and search for pro rata rule
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and backdoor Roth IRAs. Read through the analysis. That's what I did while
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   you were talking here. And I found a half a dozen articles here.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   The key is read those articles where somebody is trying to answer the question.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And then just look for the source. Go and search the IRS website,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   irs.gov, and search their website for pro rata rule and see what you
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   find. Usually what you will find is you'll find the data on the IRS website, which
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   will explain what you need to answer your question. Sometimes it will
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   be buried in a specific publication, a tax publication,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   or sometimes it'll be listed as an FAQ or some article on the
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   IRS website. But I would read the popular market articles first
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and then go directly to irs.gov and search it out there. If you don't
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   have an answer there, then you should call a tax attorney and
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   ask a tax attorney to solicit their legal opinion on the subject. If it's something that you've
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   researched and the web is not answering your question, just go and pay a tax attorney
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   a couple hundred bucks for their answer to the question
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and get specific legal advice for that specific
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   maneuver that you're planning.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah, okay. Sounds good. I appreciate it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   The other question is more general and it's kind of asset protection themed, but it's
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   both me and my spouse are sitting on
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   a reasonable amount of money in taxable brokerage accounts, which are, I don't know,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   in my understanding, relatively vulnerable to the claims of would-be creditors. I was
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   going to see if you had any kind of general rule of thumb
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   if we wanted to gain some kind of asset protection benefits on
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   brokerage accounts, what your strategy is.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   How much money is currently in those brokerage accounts?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Something like $200,000. And outside of that $200,000,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   are the balance of your assets in other exempt or protected accounts?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Yeah, I mean, essentially
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   everything else is in 401(k)s, IRAs, and our home. And about how much
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   is the balance of those 401(k)s and your home?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   About the same, about $200,000.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Okay. So what do you plan to do with the money that's in those
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   brokerage accounts?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   It's essentially our retirement savings.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I'm somewhat attracted to the
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   kind of early retirement financial independence
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   movement. Absolutely. And do you face any unique
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   liability exposure?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I run a company
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and I don't think anything in particular is interesting.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm not doing anything particularly risky or anything like that. But is the company public in terms of
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   your involvement with it? Somebody knows that you own a company, you run a company, you are
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   perceived to be a highly compensated person? Yes.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   So that's a significant risk. Well, there are a number of different approaches that you can
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   do. So the first thing is, you always think about, "What am I going to do with the money?" So if you're
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   let's say you have the money here in a temporary taxable account and you're
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   investing it into those mutual funds and they're just sitting there, but you're
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   going to use it in two years, then obviously you want to be very careful about putting additional
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   making additional moves that are going to encumber the assets
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   in some way. You wouldn't want to put it into an annuity, for example.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   You would gain some protection in
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   putting it into an annuity, but
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   well, hold on, you're a Colorado resident, right?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   No, I'm not a VPN. Okay, great.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I applaud you. What state would the IRS think
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   or what state would a creditor be suing you in that they think you're a resident?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   New Mexico. Okay. So New Mexico, we'll have to
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   look at the New Mexico laws in here in just a second. The point is, you wouldn't want to
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   encumber $200,000 in your
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   you wouldn't want to encumber $200,000 in an annuity if
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   you were going to take the money out in one or two years and then go on
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and spend it. So that would be a problem. So what are your options? Well,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   option number one is to move the asset into some
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   kind of exempt account that would help you. So let's check.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I have a chart. It's not perfect, but in New Mexico
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   you have a, if you're a resident of New Mexico, you have a $60,000
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   homestead exemption. So from an asset protection perspective
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   you would want to maintain about $60,000 of
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   equity in your homestead. New Mexico doesn't allow
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   tenancy by the entirety, so that's out as a strategy.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   New Mexico does protect IRAs and Roth IRAs, so we've already talked
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   about the fact that you're maximizing those accounts. Let's assume that you can't put any more money into
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   those. Life insurance cash values in New Mexico are protected from the claims
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   of creditors, as are life insurance proceeds
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and annuity values. So 529
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   plans are not protected in the state of New Mexico. So that's your easy checklist
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   of exempt assets in New Mexico. You would say
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   well, do I want to put the money into a homestead up to about
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   $60,000? Can I get the money into a qualified plan like my 401k
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   or an IRA or a Roth IRA? Do I want to put the money into
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   a life insurance policy and/or an annuity? And that
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   may or may not serve your interests. For example,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   the annuity, especially if you're interested in early retirement, the annuity is an interesting
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   option. You could find potentially an annuity that would allow you to
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   invest similar to the way that you're investing those funds now, depending on your investment strategy.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You could find an annuity with relatively low costs and you could just slide that $200,000
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   into an annuity contract. When you want to spend the money in
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   retirement, you would just make that particular annuity contract the foundation
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   of your long-term retirement distribution plans.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Now you would face a minor tax problem there if you retire early because annuity
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   taxation will subject you to the same rules as IRAs and Roth IRAs.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Prior to age 59.5, you'll pay a 10% penalty on any profits that are
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   taken out. But you could, anyway, there are ways that you could
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   work with that. So that would be a simple solution.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   About one of the few other options then is, do I want to put
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   this into some other private investment? If you just simply want to
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   keep the money as mutual funds, then you will have to move it into a legal structure
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   wherein those assets are protected. And so there you'll
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   sit down with an asset protection attorney or you'll draw up a trust.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   You'll have to decide about what kind of trust to do. But that's your only other
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   option as far as protecting the assets if you want to keep it just simply
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   in mutual fund shares.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Okay, excellent. And then I know that in terms of
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   asset protection, it's important to have some kind of a legitimate non-asset
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   protection reason for doing things. And so the version of that would be
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   estate planning if we were to work with a trust or that kind of thing.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Yeah, absolutely. I think you're probably a little bit, your fees
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   with $200,000 of assets, your fees are going to be
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   challenging because
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   with that relatively small amount of assets compared to
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   the costs of maintaining many trusts, you'll have to
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   assess the cost of forming an appropriate
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   trust, citing it, putting it in the
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   proper location, etc. I wouldn't jump
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   immediately to doing that. But I would say that if the numbers
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   start to grow beyond that, it's going to go beyond. So what I would be doing right now is I would
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   interview, I would be educating myself, I would be interviewing some experts
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and then go from there. But yes, to answer your specific question, yes, estate planning is always
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   a perfectly relevant thing to do.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And there is nothing wrong with, even if you're moving money into an offshore
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   asset protection trust, there's nothing wrong with doing that.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And the business purpose will be, your attorney will walk you through the business purpose and part
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   of it can be, part of it will be reflected in estate planning. Yes.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Awesome, well thank you so much.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   So I feel like I'm not giving you a very good answer and the reason
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I'm not giving you a very good answer is because the question is fairly general.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It all is going to come down to what do you want to spend the money on and
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   what will you do with the money. In short, if your plan
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   is to keep working at your company, earning an income, and this money
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and additional money is going to be invested into mutual funds
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and you don't want to purchase an insurance contract, then
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   your natural answer to that question is to establish
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   an entity, a trust, an asset protection trust to hold those
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   assets in it. Because there's not a lot you can do if you want to invest
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   using mutual funds. Now, what I would look at, for example,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and the reason that's a general answer is the first thing
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I would look at would be to say, are there any other asset classes that you might want
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   to own other than mutual funds. If you want to own gold,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   then this is the money that I would use to buy gold. Or if you want
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   to purchase real estate, then this is the money that I would use to purchase real estate. Or if you want to start
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   a business, then this is the money that I would use to start a business. And so
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   if you are keeping your investment plan extremely simple, and
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   you're saying, I'm going to work my job, build my company, do my work there, and
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I'm going to make sure that I, and all my investing
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   is just going to be mutual funds, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that plan.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It's a great plan. But what it means is your options for protecting this money
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   are simpler. And I would be remiss also in saying, just make sure that
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   you minimize liability and that you protect yourself with proper
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   amounts of insurance. But if you want to protect the assets,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   you have to move them into an exempt class
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   or you have to put some new covering around them. That's the rule.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Excellent. I always appreciate
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   your perspective. Thanks so much for unpacking that for me.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   My pleasure. Thank you for calling in. And I'm proud of you for calling in with, and masking
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   your location. Good for you. We're going out to John in Bermuda. John,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Hi, Joshua. Long time, well, short time listener, but big fan.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   My question is pretty general. I feel like I've got
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   a lot of these sorts of things, the boxes checked and maxing out
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   my 401(k), saving a pretty high
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   percentage of my income, increasing my income. But I'm trying to figure out
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   if I'm missing anything. Oh, yeah, and we have a young son and I have
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   a pretty substantial life insurance policy to cover him in the
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   event of anything bad happening. So I'm trying to think of any other
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   basic or maybe even not so basic things that maybe I should be considering or thinking of
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   on either the asset protection or taxation,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   something like that. What are your thoughts there? I know it's pretty general. What do you think you're missing?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I mean, I'm investing for, you know,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   on the investment side and the saving side, I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I don't know if maybe
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   there's, I'm exposing myself to liability that, you know, there's
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   a way I could protect myself better. That's kind of my thought.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Are you worried about something specific?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I mean, I guess getting
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   sued or, in Bermuda, the legal
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   liability theories aren't so bad. But at some point, my family and I
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   plan on returning to the United States. So I'm just trying to think if there's
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   ways to kind of set money aside and be protected for, you know, my son or
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   my wife or myself, you know, just when we return.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Because I know you had mentioned in some of your podcasts setting up some of these structures
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   well in advance might be a good idea. Right. So
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   how much money do you have? About a million.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Okay. Well, it's
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   so it's hard to answer the question
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   being a general question. So let me talk through
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   our five part framework and ask you a couple of additional questions. Because short answer is
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I don't know if there's anything that you're missing.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   We could go through the extremes. You know, do you have, do you own long term
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   care or insurance? Well, you have to say do I need it or do I not? Do you have health
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   insurance? Do you have liability insurance? Do you have life insurance? Do you have disability insurance?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Are, those would be good questions.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   We can go through your full complement of insurance portfolios on your investments. You look at it
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and you have to look at it and say am I on track with my own personal goals for
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   investing? How's my overall investment portfolio? And then you can go
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   from beginning to extreme with that. Do I own
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   mutual funds? Do I have low expenses? Am I getting good financial planning
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   advice? Do I have a good tax plan? Am I paying minimal
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   costs? Do I have a bank
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   account with gold coins and second passports for me and the kids on the other
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   side of the world in case I gotta run away? Do I, yeah, I live on an island. So do I have a boat to get
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   away or have I, have a private airplane to get me away in case we face a hurricane?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Is my house hurricane proof? I mean there are about a gazillion
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   ways that you could take the question and those are up
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   to you based upon your interests and based upon the things that you think about and that you
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   are concerned about. What I would go through is let's talk about optimizing
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   lifestyle. Let's start with your income. Are you satisfied with your
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   income, your career, your job, your business?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Yeah, pretty much. I mean, you know, you can always do better but so far it seems
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   to be on a solid upward trajectory.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So analyze your career in terms of optimization and say,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   am I doing what I want to be doing?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Am I getting joy, satisfaction, meaning out of my daily activities?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Am I earning appropriately? That's one entire area of
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   income optimization that really needs to be thought through. What about on
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   your expenses? Are you and your family living where you want to live? Are you satisfied with
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   how you're living, the amount of money that you're spending?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think Bermuda's a wonderful place to raise a family and
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   has some nice tax advantages but less so for US citizens
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   so that helps. Yeah, I'm happy here. So you are a US citizen
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and you are living in Bermuda. Do you work for a US based corporation or a foreign
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   company? A Bermuda based company.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So are you
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   and how much is your income? How much is your salary?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Roughly half a million a year but that's relatively recent.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So working at, being an employee of
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   a Bermuda based company, do you qualify for the foreign earned income exemption?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   I do. And the foreign housing
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   exemption? Yep, yeah, that's true.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And you're also exempt from social security
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   contributions, right? That's correct.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   So in your case, you basically then have the problem
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   of I'm paying a lot of income tax on my income from a hundred to
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   five hundred thousand dollars, is that right?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Yeah, that's an issue. Now, you said that you, do you
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   intend to return to the United States? Have you thought about expatriating fully and renouncing your
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   citizenship at some point? I have.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   The problem is we don't have a second passport and
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   all of our family lives in the US so we're probably, that's probably
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   not an option for us unfortunately. Have you explored the paths
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   of obtaining a second passport?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I know there are places where you can buy them.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I think St. Kitts I've heard, but. So let me walk you through.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I mean we're both. Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, finish please.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I mean we're both, my wife and I are both
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I'm probably seventh generation American, she's fourth
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so I don't know how, we don't really have a ton of birthright options. Okay.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Or, you know, historical legacy options. How old are your children?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I have a son who's
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   a little bit under a year. And did you register him?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Is he a US citizen? He is.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Bermuda doesn't allow birthright citizenship. Okay.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   So with passports, so let's talk that through because it's certainly an interesting
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   area of optimization. Do you think that your income is going to continue at the
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   half a million dollar per year number and above going forward?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Yeah, most likely. And your estimated
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   federal, US federal income tax bill on that income is about how much?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I think like 50, 50,000
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   if I'm right. I might be wrong on that. Seems a little bit light to me.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Is this going to be your first year earning half a million?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, this will be this year. Basically everything
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   kind of got, happened in January. So I'm thinking about last year's
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   last year's tax numbers. Right, right. So remember this about the
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   foreign earned income exemption. Your first about $100,000, I think
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   it's about $104,000 something. Let's just say $100,000. Your first $100,000 of
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   income is exempt from US federal income tax.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   But my understanding of the tax code is your next $100,000 of income
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   is taxed as though it were, it's not taxed as
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   though it's your first $100,000. It's taxed as though it's your second $100,000.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   So you can avoid all of the tax on the first about $100,000
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   of income. But from $200,000 to $500,000 you're going
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   to be paying US federal income tax at that bracket
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   at those higher marginal brackets. And so certainly when you get up
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   there to $500,000 your highest tax dollars are going to be
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   sorry, that top $100,000 of $400,000 to $500,000
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   is going to be taxed at pretty close to 40%.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   So depending on any extenuating circumstances
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   you know, it's your accountant's job. The point is you are in the highest
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   you're going to be in those very high brackets. And so
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   $50,000 doesn't sound in any way accurate
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   to me. But I would encourage you to sit down with your accountant or sit down
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   with an accountant and talk it through with them. Now I'm not
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   sure that you should expatriate fully and renounce your
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   citizenship just to save on taxes. But I do think that you should carefully
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   count the cost and you should consider what the best move is
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   with the money. First, do you qualify for
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   citizenship by naturalization in Bermuda or are you
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   on track to qualify for citizenship by naturalization? Do they offer that in Bermuda?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   They did but
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   that had closed. They always
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   kind of every 10 years consider reopening it but then they typically shut it
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   down. So there are four basic ways of
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   qualifying for a second nationality, a second citizenship.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Those four basic ways are number one, just the
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   special way. So the government says, "Hey, this person is uniquely
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   interesting to us and we want to confer upon them citizenship."
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Usually this happens if you are a celebrity or if you're a highly ranked business
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   person or you're some kind of well-known entertainer, things like that.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Peter Thiel was granted New Zealand citizenship famously a few years ago
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   after I think having spent something like nine days in the country. Why did that happen?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   The government of New Zealand said, "Hey, we like Peter Thiel. We'd be happy to grant this citizenship on him."
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   So sometimes countries do that for somebody who's an outstanding
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   entertainer or a famous singer or somebody who they want to
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   somebody who would be perhaps a, what's it called when there's somebody who's
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   fleeing, an asylum seeker of some kind. And they just by an act of the president
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   of the parliament or the legislative body, they confer this citizenship upon
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   somebody. That's the least useful way for most of us who are mere mortals.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   So let's ignore that, but that is the first way.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Beyond that, there are three basic ways that you can qualify for and earn
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   a second citizenship. You can live somewhere
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   for a long time and qualify for citizenship by naturalization.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And that time period can range from really as short as one or two years
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   in some places. Three years is very frequent. Up to some countries
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   25 or 30 years is the process it takes. But citizenship by naturalization.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   The second way is citizenship by
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   history, by family history. You have some kind of family history
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   from a nation that will grant citizenship based upon
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   that family history, that family tree. And then the third way is economic citizenship
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   where you simply purchase the citizenship and you
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   pay for it. And there are a bunch of options there.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Some of these are fast. Some of them are easy. Some of them are cheap. There's kind of that
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   tri-effect, which is like you go to your mechanic and they say you can have this fast,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   cheap, or good. In citizenship you basically have this realm of
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   fast, easy, or cheap. So you mentioned about your ethnic history.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   You don't have on all of
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   your wife's lineage basically you're US Americans for many generations.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Is that right? Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   So let's ignore that. Many people do have, if you sort through your family
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   tree and you think about my grandparents or my great-grandparents, many people do
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   have some kind of ethnicity where they can apply for citizenship
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   based upon their family tree. And that
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I think most people should if they qualify for that. Then the next thing would
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   be citizenship by naturalization. You're currently
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   living in Bermuda and you're not sure of the Bermuda laws. But what I would
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   say is you should carefully look at the laws and speak to
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   somebody knowledgeable and see if you can become a citizen of Bermuda
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   while you are living there. Most countries in the world, with just a few
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   exceptions, most countries in the world have a path to citizenship
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   for those who live in that country for an extended period of time. How long have you lived in
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Bermuda? About seven years.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   So I don't know, I'm not familiar with the laws of Bermuda, but I would
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   encourage you to investigate that. And it's hard for me to think that there wouldn't be
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   by the time you have
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   there wouldn't be a way for you to start, be on that process towards citizenship
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   in Bermuda. Your fastest options then would be, but you
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   can, just because you're living in Bermuda doesn't mean that you can't also start the process
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   of doing citizenship by naturalization in another place. Do
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   you think that you'll be, you plan to keep working in Bermuda at this current job?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Yeah, at this job or a similar
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   one, yeah. And is this company global? Is there any way for you to move to another place?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   They mainly have operations in the United
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   States. They might have, they may get something in the UK though. Okay.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So for, just the reason I pointed out is there may be ways if you wanted to
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   if you wanted to pull up the details and look
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   for different places. There are other countries that you can go live in, but there are a number of
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   countries where you can start the process of a citizenship by naturalization
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   without being there full time. Now these rules have changed.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   There are a number of countries in the world that are well known for the fact that you can go
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   there, you can apply to be a resident of that country, you can get a resident visa
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and you can start the clock ticking towards a status of citizenship.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   There are only a couple of those out there and I would refer you to your own research to know the specific ones.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   But they're not always guaranteed. You can, for example, I'll just go with
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   one of the more popular ones. A country like Panama, Panama has something they call the friendly nations
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   visa, where if you want to become a resident of Panama, you can go to Panama
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   you can deposit I think it's about 5,000 bucks in a Panamanian bank account
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   and then apply for a friendly nations visa and they'll give you a resident
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   visa for Panama. Now if you have that resident
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   visa, the idea is once you've had that visa for I think it's five years
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   then once you've had that visa, you're in a situation where you can apply
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   for citizenship. Now there's no guarantee of getting this and there are other countries
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   you can do this as well. There are a couple of countries in South America, etc.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   There's no guarantee that you can get this and it's not easy, especially
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   if you're not going to actually spend time in the country. For any residency by naturalization
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   process to work, even if the letter of the law doesn't say a specific
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   amount of time that you can be
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   a resident in that situation, you still need to
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   sorry I'm getting tongue tied, even if the law doesn't
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   say you have to be there, you need to be there for most of the time, but you could pursue something
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   like that. The third option, so that's a qualification
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   for citizenship by
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   naturalization with some of those countries. The third option is economic citizenship
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and your fastest way to get a passport if you need one is just to simply go
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and buy one. And so there are a number of countries that sell citizenships. They range
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   from inexpensive, they're in the Caribbean where you are
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   you've got St. Kitts and Nevis has one, I think Granada has one,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Dominica has one. The prices for those range from about, I think
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   there's one that's $50,000, most of them are about $100,000 for a citizenship
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   for one person and then some of them have different family connections as well.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   There are also higher end citizenships.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   The cream of the crop is Malta. It costs you, I think it's about a million and a half bucks
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   if you want to pursue citizenship with the island of Malta
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   but there you get an EU passport, access to the Schengen area, Europe, etc.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   So there are at least a dozen around the world places where you can simply
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   go and buy economic citizenship. If you're not already
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   doing that, I would consider it because if you're happy living outside the United States
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   and you continue on this current earnings trajectory, it's kind of
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   frustrating to live in a country like Bermuda which has no income tax
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and still be sending hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   back to the United States. Now you may not want to
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   renounce your citizenship right away but you should at least
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   know what's necessary to do it and you should at least be on that path.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   By the way, I looked up
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   with Bermuda, the rules for Bermuda and here's what they say. You can apply for
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Bermudian status, I assume that means citizenship, if you possess a qualifying
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Bermudian connection, so you have to have some kind of qualifying connection
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and/or, and then it goes on, and if you've been a resident
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   in Bermuda for 10 continuous years prior to the date of application.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So they have a couple other things as well but if you should research that and see if you can work that out
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   since you've been there 7 years, if you're going to be there 10 years, work hard to see if you can
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   stay there in Bermuda. What I would do, do you and your wife
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   what I would recommend, do you and your wife plan to have any more children?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Yeah, we do. Okay, so what I would do is
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   when you are pregnant with your next baby, I would consider birth tourism
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   if I were you. I would encourage you to consider birth tourism. Consider having the baby
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   in a country that grants citizenship
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   birthright citizenship to that baby and also consider doing it
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   in a country where that birthright citizenship for the baby
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   will provide certain benefits for you and your wife.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So birthright citizenship, there are about 30 countries in the world that offer birthright citizenship
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   where any baby born in the physical territory of that country will
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   provide, will confer upon you citizenship. Most of them are in the
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Americas and the Caribbean. So all throughout the Americas, Canada,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Costa Rica, Panama, down through South America, Colombia, Brazil,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, basically almost
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   all of the Americas with a few exceptions and then several of the islands in the
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Caribbean. So for example, islands such as Dominica. Dominica offers birthright
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   citizenship in addition to selling citizenship. And so if you
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   go and have a child in one of those countries, your child will
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   automatically be a dual citizen. A citizen of that country
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   as well as a citizen of the United States if you register
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   them with the US State Department for a US passport.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   But one of the benefits though is as the parents of those children
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   you'll automatically qualify for permanent residency with
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   you'll automatically qualify for permanent residency with
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   being the parent. So countries like Costa Rica or Panama
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   or Colombia, I think Colombia, Mexico. If you're the parent of a Mexican baby
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   or you're the parent of a Costa Rican baby, you can automatically go and be in that country.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   One of the fastest ones is Brazil. Brazil has a program where
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   if you have a baby in Brazil, your baby automatically is a citizen of
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Brazil. And then if you are the parent or the
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   minor sibling of a Brazilian baby, you automatically
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   qualify for a permanent resident visa. So you can live, work in Brazil
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   permanently. And then Brazil actually has the fastest program in the world that I'm aware of
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   where if you are a permanent resident of Brazil in as little as one year
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   of living there as a permanent resident, if you are the parent of a Brazilian baby
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   in as little as one year, you can apply to the Brazilian government for citizenship by naturalization.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Now of course in Brazil there's no guarantee that you're going to have it in a
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   year, but you can apply. So the point is, if I were you, you have the money
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   you should search out some of the people who consult in that business. You should seriously
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   consider that plan. Because if you do the math, let's say you're going to pay a hundred
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I mean, you're going to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars of tax
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   unnecessarily each year for the next decade. Is that
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   a conservative assumption? That sounds about
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   right. When you say it like that, it's pretty painful to hear, but yeah, that sounds about
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   right. So you're going to pay 1.5 million dollars in the next decade
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   on tax. That's unnecessary because you're living and working in Bermuda.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Now in that situation, that's a lot
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   of money. Now think, how old are you now?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Mid-thirties. Okay, so let's just say you invested a million and a half
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   dollars at the age of 45, and let's say
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   that you're doing that for your children. I mean, you're a financial guy
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   obviously if you're living in Bermuda. So, you know, present value
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   let's invest for 40 years at 8% interest, no payments. That
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   million and a half dollars could potentially be 32 million dollars of
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   legacy that if you invested at 8% lump sum, if you
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   legacy of what you could leave behind for children or whomever
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   based upon your citizenship. So your US citizenship
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   is costing you potentially 32 million dollars if
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   you followed that route that I went. So if it were me,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   if I were in your shoes, I would certainly be very willing to
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   go and purchase an economic citizenship, you know, go
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   and get one of the decent ones, but they're perfectly adequate of Caribbean
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   citizenship. Don't necessarily renounce your US citizenship right off the
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   bat, but get an economic citizenship so you have
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   something right away. Consider the birthright tourism so you can put yourself on
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   track for a second citizenship by naturalization process
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   and then think carefully and see what if you
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   need anything else. Sorry, see if you still need that US passport
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   because that US passport is going to wind up costing you multiple six
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   figures per year going forward over the coming decade. Now obviously if your
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   whole family is based in the United States, obviously that's going to be tough to
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   figure out how do I, you know, there's going to be a lot of connections, a lot of emotion
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   to it, but if I were you, you should go and search out, I would say go and search out
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   some good advice to help you solve that problem. That would be what I would say.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Go to my
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   recommendation. A long, long time ago I interviewed
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Andrew Henderson from Nomad Capitalist here on the podcast.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Go and look at, consult with him, tell him I sent you, but go and
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   consult with Andrew. He is the expert at this stuff and he
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   knows far more than I do and he would be able to help you put together
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   a plan that could work if you wanted it to because there's certainly in your case
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   you have a compelling financial interest to at least investigate it.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   That's a great point.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   No, when you really laid it out like that,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   that's the thing that I'm missing.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Good. You could send me a fee on your 30 million bucks we just saved
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   your family. I mean, in all seriousness, the biggest
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   thing that US persons face, US persons don't generally want to do
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   what I'm describing to you. Usually because they're living in the US,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   they're constantly in the US and that's what they do, they're living
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   in the US. But there's no reason, since you're already living outside
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   of the US, then you've
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   already crossed that hurdle. So, I want to just
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   it's hard for me because what you have to be careful of is
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   you're in the income bracket where you can't get rid of US tax without
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   renouncing citizenship and the risk you face if you ultimately go
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   all the way to renouncing citizenship, and by the way, one warning for you,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   renouncing citizenship, is your net worth
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   currently in excess of 2 million dollars?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Actually, no. Okay. So, there is, in the renunciation process,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   so if you want to renounce citizenship, there's a whole process to it, I'll skip most
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   of the details. The important thing for you to know is the 2 million dollar number. If your net worth
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   is more than 2 million dollars, then not only do you have to pay the
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   US fees for renouncing citizenship, which I think are 2,000 or 2,600
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   dollars, something like that, about 2 grand, but in addition to paying those fees,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   you actually have to pay an exit tax on your wealth over 2 million
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   dollars. If you have a net worth of under 2 million dollars, you don't have to pay
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   an exit tax, and the requirements of the past where you had to pay
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   kind of that, what do they call it, I don't know, the ghost tax or whatever, like 10 or 12 years of
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   tax payments, that's all gone and in the past now, but the point is, once
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   your net worth starts to approach that number, it's going to become continually expensive
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   for you to renounce if you wind up going in that direction. Now,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   back on track with what I was saying. The risk you're always concerned is, "All my family's in the US, I'm multi
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   generations in the US, etc. What should I do?" Well,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   if you, you've got to be careful
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   because if you really need access to the US, then you're going to need to make sure
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   that you have a passport that will give you access to the US relatively
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   simply, and your solution there is going to be,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   there are only a handful of countries that have visa-free access to the United
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   States. Beyond that, you have to apply for a visa to get into the United
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   States if you ultimately renounce citizenship. So I would be very careful, given your
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   long-standing ties with the US, etc., I would be very careful if I were you. Again, you need somebody
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   far more knowledgeable than I am on this particular topic, and you need to
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   give it a lot of time, do a lot of serious thinking, do some calculations, really
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   think about it. But you have an advantage in the fact that you've already been abroad,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   you're already used to living in Bermuda, you've already put that in place,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and so there's a heavy price tag every single year, especially with these new
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   and growth increases in income. You're going to be stroking multi-six-figure checks
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   each year for reasons that are probably
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   largely emotional. So it might take you some time to work it through, but you should at least
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   seriously consider it. And even if you're not ready to renounce, start the
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   wheels turning on getting new citizenships so that if
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   you ultimately do renounce, you're ready to go. Because it's
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   going to take years, unless you're ready to go and buy an economic citizenship and renounce
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   on that one single citizenship, it's going to take you years to
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   get all the wheels turning to get full citizenships done. The economic ones are
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   fast, you can have those in a few months. Or they can
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   be fast. Otherwise, it's going to take you a lot of time to really
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   have those citizenships in hand, and you'll probably want a portfolio of citizenships
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   instead of just a single one. It's going to take you some time, take you some work, but that gives you time to think
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   about it and decide if you really want to ultimately renounce or not.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   That's the best optimization I got for you today.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   That's a good one. Thanks a lot, Joshua. My pleasure, sir.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Alright, next, got a couple questions that listeners,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   patrons of the show wrote in because they couldn't call in.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   A couple of patrons here and a couple non-patrons. Mike writes in and says, "Joshua, I've got a question
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   that might help you sleep by tomorrow, given the fact that I live in the People's Republic of China." Don't feel bad
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   if you don't answer this. I'm sure real callers are better off for your show. "I've been working here
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   in saving, and I'm in the process of sending $10,000 back to the United States
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   and will be moving back to join a program which works with low-income students in Catholic
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   schools. I have a small stock portfolio, a small
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   Fundrise account, and a small 401k, altogether, totally, around $9,000
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   US. I also have an emergency fund of around $5,000
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   and student debt of around $20,000. I've been doing well on returns
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   over the past two years. Everyone has. My question is, what should I do with this
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   money? Housing is provided by the program, so I'm not concerned about that or about
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   transportation. Thank you for reading this and thank you for your time. God bless." Well, Mike,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   it's a good question, and what I would say is you need to think about your lifestyle,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   what you would like to have happen with your lifestyle going forward.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Now, the great news is the only debt that you have is your student loan debt.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   So my first question is, are you planning to pay that off yourself
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   or are you trying to pursue some program of
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   income-based repayment and/or debt forgiveness? Sometimes with
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   teachers, and it sounds like you're going to be doing some teaching, sometimes with teachers,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   teachers are seeking to participate in a program where there will be student debt cancellation.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   If you're pursuing one of those programs, you will have to work
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   that through yourself. If you're not pursuing one of those programs, what I would encourage
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   you to do is keep your emergency fund. I would
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   say maybe keep about $10,000 and then work as quickly as you can to pay off
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   those student loans. Now, the question we always face is
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   should you pay off debt or invest based upon interest rates?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   There's a good chance your student loan debt is at a modest interest rate.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   But given the circumstances you're in, about
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   traveling around the world, living in China, now coming back to the United States, I think
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   you probably would get more benefit from the lifestyle considerations
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   of being completely debt free and of having all of your future completely open
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   to you without having to make any mandatory payments of any kind,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   such as student loan payments. So, given what you've said, if you're not
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   pursuing one of those student debt cancellation programs, especially consider
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   you plan to go back and work in Catholic schools. I don't know if those would qualify.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   But if you're not pursuing a student loan cancellation program,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   then what I would encourage you to do, maybe amp up your emergency fund around $10,000.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   That way you have a little bit more flexibility. You can do a few
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   more things if you want to change things around and then just simply pay off the
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   student loans. And then from there, keep saving money and work out
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   your longer term plans. See if there's a longer term thing that you'd like to
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   pursue. I just think your biggest benefits are going to come from not having any
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   payments because that'll ultimately free you up mentally and it'll
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   free you up in reality for any future, any change of life course
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   that comes in the future. Joseph writes in, says, "Josh, I won't be able to get away from work
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   to get on today's call. I thought I'd email my question instead. Background. My wife and I are
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   24 years old. We have a four-month-old daughter. I made $63,000 per
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   year and my wife is a commission-based cosmetologist and makes between $30,000
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   and $35,000 working three days a week. We own our house
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   valued at $80,000 and we owe $50,000 left on the mortgage,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   about $500 a month payment. We have around $9,000 in retirement
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   accounts, $2,000 in an emergency fund, about $1,500
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   of extra disposable income monthly. You were my first
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   financial podcast and then I soon found Dave Ramsey. Don't agree with everything he says, but I've taken
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   a few bits of his advice. We owe $9,000 on one car, nothing on our
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   second. We have $10,000 on a 0% credit card. We also have
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   $43,780 in student loan debt. I've completed
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   my degree and am working in my field of study. We would like one day to own
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   land and live off of it as much as possible within reason. We're planning on a minimum
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   of 20 acres. We also want to own rental property. Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Bigger Pocket,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Stacking Benjamins, Afford Anything, Fire Drill, and a few more have all helped me decide that real estate
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   is meant for me. In your opinion, should we pay the minimum on everything
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   and stack cash until we can afford the down payment on the property we
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   want and then save for the building of our dream home on it? Or should we
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   pay off all of our debt with gazelle intensity? Or should we start with the rental property?
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   I know it's a lot, maybe there's some things I've forgotten, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Best regards, Joseph. So in summary, Joseph and his wife
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   together make about just under $100,000. They own a
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   house with an $80,000 value, $30,000 of equity, the loans
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   of $50,000 on it. Have some money in retirement accounts, some debt,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   etc. So Joseph, here's what I would say. First,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   it's important that you differentiate between consumption
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   and investments. There is a
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   huge difference between planning to buy a minimum of 20 acres
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   and build a dream home versus buying rental properties.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   The purchase of 20 acres and a dream home,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   you can spend your money on that, but it will suck up
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   everything you've got and it will probably mean that you won't be very wealthy.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Now if you're going to pursue rental property, then the 20 acres
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   and the dream home is nothing but an impediment for you, given
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   your plans of building a real estate portfolio.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   If your needs are met in your current
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   house, I would encourage you not to pursue the
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   dream home at this stage of life. You're only 24 years old,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   you have one new baby, this is not the time to go out and start spending
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   money on a dream home. You're not yet rich. You're richer than most people,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   but you're not yet rich. You're not yet financially independent.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   And so the first thing you have to do is get rich,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   then go and buy a dream home. Now, what's your plan
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   to get rich? Depends on how serious you are with your investment activities
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   and it depends on what your opportunities are for your career.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   You're currently making $63,000 a year, your wife is working making $30,000 to
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   $35,000, so you've got a good healthy income. So with that,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   the question is, do you have the biggest opportunities in your career
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   or do you have the biggest opportunities in your investments?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Let me foil two different examples.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   You might be making $63,000 a year
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   driving trucks, making deliveries in your local area, you don't
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   say what you do for work. That's fine, it's an adequate income.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Perfectly fine. But there's no opportunity for advancement
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   and there's no possibility that your career is going to take off.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Earning $63,000 a year doesn't mean, at driving trucks, there's no
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   chance that 10 years from now you're going to be driving trucks and making $630,000 a year.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Now, compare that to somebody who's making
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   $63,000 a year and they are selling
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   life insurance. You could be making $63,000 a year
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   selling life insurance and there's no reason in the world why 10 years from now
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   you shouldn't be making $630,000 per year selling life insurance.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   So the first thing to analyze is your career. Have you
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   chosen or developed a career that has a massive growth potential
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   or have you chosen or developed a career that pays your bills?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   If you've chosen a career that pays your bills, then you need to focus on your investment plan.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   If you've chosen a career that has massive career potential, you need
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   to focus on investing in your career. If I were selling
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   life insurance, making $63,000 a year, I would not
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   whatsoever be messing around with real estate.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   The reason is you have too much upside in life insurance and the real estate takes too long
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   and it's too much of a hassle and it's too expensive for you to go and learn that business.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   So if you're making $63,000 a year selling life insurance, don't worry about real estate.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Focus on your life insurance business. Grow that $63,000 income to
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   a $263,000 income to a $630,000 income
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   and along the way, pay off all your debt, save
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   lots of money, and just simply invest slowly. There'd be no
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   problem at all if you're making $630,000 a year for you to own that 20 acres
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   and a dream house and for it to be an expensive house, but you're not
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   investing in real estate to do that. Now if you're a truck driver or
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   an equivalent in terms of your career potential, then in your case what you
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   need to do is you need to massively increase your investment returns and
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   your income. And that's only going to happen through focused investment.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   And so if you're in that situation,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   what I would do is I would focus first on real estate investing. Because
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   if you've decided that real estate investing is going to be your ticket to more income, you've got to make
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   more than $63,000. If you've decided real estate investing is your most
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   practical way to do that, you've got some work to do.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   If that's the path that you're pursuing, then your best solution is stack
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   aside as much cash as possible, and then you'll want to make sure
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that you have every bit of liquid cash available, find good deals,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   learn how to invest in real estate, be very, very careful as you go,
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   but make sure the real estate portfolio grows, that it cash
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   flows, whatever your particular real estate strategy is, it can take you a while to figure that out,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   but in that situation you want to stack cash. And so if I
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   wanted to pursue real estate, would I pay off debt as quickly as
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   possible? Not if I were sure that that was my aggressive plan.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   I would keep as much money around as possible, and I wouldn't
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   pay debts that were high interest rates.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   So I wouldn't, you know, if I'm paying 0% on a credit card,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I would just keep that at 0%, stack up some more money.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   If the student loan debt is relatively low, I'd be careful with that, but the $9,000
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   on the car, I would probably just pay minimum payments and stack up as much money as possible
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   to pursue real estate. Now,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   how do I answer that? I don't know how to give you any more than that. It's not that paying off the debt
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   wouldn't be good, but if real estate is what you're going to do, then
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   get busy, but you need the cash more than you need to be out of debt right now.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   So, basically the major
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   concept I want to leave you with is, what's going to be your economic engine? You need an
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   economic engine to get rich. And so that economic engine, what's it
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   going to be? Is it going to be your job, or is it going to be real estate?
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Whatever your choice is, you need to make sure that
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   you first, whatever your choice is,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   you need to make sure that you're focusing on building that economic engine first.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   That's my point. Now, back to your dream property. Walk away
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   from anything that sounds like a dream home
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   until you're rich. The biggest problem, especially
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   that US Americans have with their finances, is they buy things like dream homes
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   when they're not rich. And this is very alluring.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   This world is very seductive. You start going out, looking at houses,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   you're looking around, you're seeing opportunities and options
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   that come your way, and you look at it and you say, "Ah, we
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   would be so happy here." Look at the view. Look at the space.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Listen to the quiet. And if you start looking at that stuff when you're not rich,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   you will convince yourself to buy it, and you'll figure out how to convince yourself a way to
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   pay for it. And you will be stuck, because you cannot get rich
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   if you're consuming all your income. And that's what dream homes do.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   They consume your income. And you don't have enough of a financial
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   base or enough of an income yet to be thinking about buying dream homes.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   But, is there a way that you could get
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   this better? Don't be scared to think
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   creatively. Now, I don't know what's available to you where you are.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   But if I were sure that I wanted to own a lot of
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   land, I'll tell you what I would do in your situation. I don't know what
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   your job is, etc. But I would think, "Is there a way that I can move to the land
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   and my wife and I earn some of our income
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   from the land while also maintaining our job
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   while also setting ourselves up in a place for
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   purchasing real estate?" So, the first thing to do is, I would look around and say,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   "How much does land cost where you are, and could you find a deal?"
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   If you could find a deal on your own land, and you didn't want to help somebody else with their
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   land, what I would consider doing is I would take the
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   house that I'm living in, I would rent it out, hopefully at a profit,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   I would buy 20 acres, hopefully that 20 acres has
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   an old barn on it. You got one kid, and you and your wife are young,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   you shouldn't have a lot of stuff yet, get an old fifth wheel, a nice big comfortable
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   one, get an old fifth wheel, park it inside the barn, and make that where you live.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   That cuts your expenses down,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   puts more income coming in, you should be able to do that and still work and
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   earn an income. You don't have enough children where you can't fit in a fifth wheel. And then
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   buy the land and live there while you're building your real estate
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   portfolio. Enjoy being on the land, but walk away from the $400,000
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   house at this point in time. Enjoy the land and build your
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   empire. If you can't do that, look around and see, is there somebody who
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   has 20 acres of land that would allow me to work out something with them? Does somebody
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   need a caretaker? Is there a farmer who needs help and a farm hand?
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   Is there a wealthy property owner who would love to have a young
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   reliable couple living on their property with them?
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   You know, you've got to put a single wide mobile home on the property on the backside and you watch
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   the property for them. You may be able to find an option like that if you look around.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And that's the kind of thing that at this phase of your life you should
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   be doing. The goal should be, how can I keep my living expenses
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   at the bare minimum so that I can maximize
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   my choices in life and so that I can maximize my
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   investment dollars? And so, yes, it's great that your house isn't expensive,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   but if you can swap out that $500 a month payment in exchange
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   for an $800 a month rental income payment and
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   then go and find a place and buy, again, a fifth wheel for
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   $4,000 and have it hauled to the property or buy a single wide mobile home somewhere,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   have it put on somebody's 20 acres and you're the property caretaker,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   you can make a profound change and free up a couple thousand dollars a month net
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   by the time you make those changes to be able to now have extra money
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   to invest in your real estate empire. So,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   think about that. And then finally, back to your income. If you're serious about real estate, you're going
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   to need to do a couple of things. Number one, if you're going to borrow money,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   you're going to need to either learn how to borrow it from the people that you're doing business with,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   not from a bank. If you're going to borrow money from a bank, you're going to need to keep an income
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   visible on paper with a good W-2 income would be your easiest way to get traditional
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   financing. You're also going to need some flexibility
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   in your schedule. You're going to need time to go and look at properties. You're going to need to plan.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   So, invest in your education. Read the books. If I were you,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   I'd encourage you to start with John Reed's books, johntreed.com.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Buy all his real estate books. He's one of the best no-nonsense guys
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   out there and you will find a much better return on investment
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   buying those books and reading them than going to real estate seminars at this phase of your
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   knowledge. So, start with that.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Those are my thoughts.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Hope that sends you in the right direction. I'm going to take one more question here on today's show because the
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   second part of it is certainly timely in terms of the national conversation. The first part is financial.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   The second part is, it is financial, but it's
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   one of those more tangential ones. Chloe writes in and says, "Hi, Josh.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   I really enjoy your podcasts and have been listening for a few years now. I have a lot of respect for you and
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   your advice. Thank you for providing this resource." My pleasure, Chloe. "I have a 15-month-old
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   daughter and I can't seem to find a helpful list of ways to invest for her
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   other than the generic advice of a 529 plan. I have a whole life
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   insurance policy in her name through Northwestern Mutual and of course term as well, but
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   it seems the biggest recommendation is the 529 plans. I'm not convinced
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   this is for us because I don't know what learning institutions will be like in 18 years
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   and I don't want the money to be hindered. I've heard you mention on a recent
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   podcast that an option could be for a grandparent to open a Roth IRA with the child
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   as a beneficiary and then convert it to a stretch IRA. That seems to be a good route
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   to me, but I was wondering why it needs to be a grandparent rather than me."
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Chloe, she goes on with this part too, which I'll get to in a moment. Chloe, it's a
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   good question and I need to write that course. I need to.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   I've been working so hard to fix all the problems in the infrastructure of my business
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   so I can write that course for you. And so hopefully I'll get that one done soon.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   But let me just give you a short answer to it first with regard to your specific
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   question of Roth IRA and why can't you do it. You can do it
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   and you should do it. But in general, the reason I talked about a grandparent
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   specifically the idea that I alluded to was you're giving
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   money to a grandparent for the grandparent to fund an IRA
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   or Roth IRA in the grandparent's name with the
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   child as a beneficiary of that so that the child
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   could inherit it as a stretch IRA. That particular idea
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   was simply the circumstances were the facts that I assumed
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   in giving that idea was number one, the parent is already funding
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   an IRA whereas the grandparent is not funding
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   a Roth IRA. Excuse me, Roth IRA all throughout. So I'm assuming the parent
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   is already funding a Roth IRA or is prohibited from funding a Roth IRA
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   due to income restrictions and the grandparent is able to contribute to
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   a Roth IRA but is not currently doing it because of not having the income.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   It doesn't have to be a grandparent. It can be an uncle. It could be your brother.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   It could be any person who has earned income.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   Any person who has earned income, you can fund a Roth IRA for them. The idea is
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   simply it's a shame to waste a person's earned income
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   if they have earned income and aren't making a Roth IRA contribution.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   It's a shame to waste that contribution and not have it go for the
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   benefit of somebody. The problem is in what I described, that's an informal
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   relationship that doesn't protect you legally. So if your brother
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   has earned income, so he qualifies for a Roth IRA
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   but he's not contributing to a Roth IRA
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   you could go and give him $6,000 and say, "Hey, put this in a
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Roth IRA and make my daughter as the beneficiary." The problem is once you give
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   him that money, you can't force him to put it into the Roth IRA nor do you
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   have any legal control over the money whatsoever. He could take it
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   and run and he would be entirely within his legal right to do
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   so. Now it would obviously spoil Thanksgiving Day dinner, but he would be
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   within his legal right to do so. And so the reason I suggested a grandparent was
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   simply most grandparents are not going to steal money from their grandchildren. They're not.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And if you suspect that they will, don't give it to them. But yes, you could do
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   it yourself, but the better thing is just you invest in a Roth IRA for your own benefit
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   and then plan to leave that behind as a beneficiary. Your daughter is a
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   beneficiary anyway. The point is if you have extra money that you can't fit into your Roth IRA
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   what do you do with that? So let me answer that question. Don't think
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   that you have to invest in a certain type of account
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   to invest effectively.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   It's perfectly fine
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   if your daughter is receiving birthday money for her one year birthday or two year birthday
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   it's perfectly fine to put those dollar bills in an envelope and stick
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   them under the mattress.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   It's also perfectly fine for you to simply open a bank account and put it in for her.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Not everything has to be done in an account.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   And you are right to be suspicious of 529 accounts.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   Now there's nothing wrong with 529 accounts. They can be very useful.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   They might save you a little bit of money. There are many situations
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   in which I would recommend them, but they're not a panacea. And what
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   I share your annoyance with the fact that if you go to
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   a web search, you go to DuckDuckGo.com and you type in
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   how to invest in your children's for your children, the only answer you're going to get
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   is basically a 529 account. And that's because financial advisors sell 529
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   accounts. So the majority of the US American
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   financial advice industry is oriented around products that can be
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   sold. That's just the way the business works.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   Nobody says, "Well, just go put the money in a bank account." Because how does a
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   financial advisor earn commissions on money that you put in a bank account? We earn commissions on 529
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   accounts. Not much, because people don't put much money in them. But I think I would rather most people
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   who save $1,000 here and $1,000 there and put the money
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   for a 529 account, I'd much rather they just spend it on the kid.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Spend it on the kid with extracurricular activities. Spend it on tutoring to help the child
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   do better in school. Spend it on books. Spend it on hobby material.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   Spend it on tools for the child to develop their skills and their interests.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Spend it on a car for the child. Or spend it on sending the child to Spain for the
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   summer to practice Spanish. I think I would rather, in almost every
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   circumstance, I would rather the people who are only saving $1,000 or $2,000 here and there
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   just spend it on the child. Because your return on investment will be
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   far higher if you spend it on the education of the child.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   And I'm completely serious with that recommendation. I think it will
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   do your daughter much more good for you and she
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   when she's 13 years old to go to buy plane tickets
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   to South America and spend 6 months or 3 months
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   or whatever you can do to get away. I would rather you spend $6,000
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   on 3 months traveling around South America together, riding the
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   buses, staying in the hostel, taking some Spanish lessons, surfing at the beach,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   climbing the volcanoes. That to me seems like a much better
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   use for $6,000 than spending it and putting it in some
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   529 account to go to some overpriced educational institution that doesn't
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   need the money and... I'll try not to rant. The point is
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   spend it on your child. If you'll adjust
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   your brain to spending the money on your child
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   and recognize that that's a perfectly legitimate
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   investment, I think you'll start to see more options.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Now, if you've got $50,000 and you're trying to figure out what to do
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   with it, a 529 account is perfectly fine for some of that money. It's hard to spend
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   $50,000 on a 15 month old. But if you're spending a couple hundred dollars
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   here and there, spend it. Spend it now. I think you'll
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   get a better bang for your buck. Next, even if you are going to
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   invest the money, don't think that you have to invest it through some
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   plan that brings problems or brings certain options.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   If you want to invest the money in stocks, fine. Recognize though that you don't have to
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   invest the money in stocks. You could go buy a rental house
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   and mentally note, "This is my daughter's rental house. Buy one rental house for each
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   of your children. Have a plan to pay it off by the time they're adults
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   and then give it to them." I'll talk about how to do that effectively
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   another time. So you could do that if that was what you wanted to do. But what most people
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   want to do is just buy some stocks. Recognize this. You can just simply go
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   and buy a mutual fund. You can go to Vanguard and
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   buy an index fund and put the money into that index fund.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   It can be an account in your name or it can be a custodial account for
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   your child. And there's no problem with it.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   There's no problem whatsoever. What would you give up if you just
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   simply went to Vanguard, bought an index fund for your daughter? Well, you would
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   incur a little bit of taxation. The risk is if you start to get into kitty tax
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   if she earns more than a couple thousand dollars a year on unearned income, interest payments
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   then she's going to pay kitty tax. But the first couple thousand dollars, about $1800 a year
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   there's no tax due on that. But even if she is subject
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   to kitty tax, there's not much taxation on a stable index
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   fund. It's not traded much. It's a capital gains. Most of it is going to be capital gains
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   taxes. There's just not much taxation on an index fund. It's not that
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   big of a problem. You can put any amount of money into it and then when you're ready to spend it
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   you can take it out and spend it on anything. So what benefit do you get from a 529 plan?
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   You don't get a tax deduction for the 529 plan now. The only
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   thing you get from a 529 plan is tax-deferred
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   growth and you don't pay tax
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   on the growth if you use the money for qualified educational expenses.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   Most people are not going to put much money in a 529 plan
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   where it becomes worth it. So, free yourself
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   from those constraints. Look at your daughter
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   and just think, "What do I think would be in the best
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   interest of my daughter? Based upon our
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   situation, what would be the best way for me to invest in my
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   daughter? How can
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   I do that? How can I invest it in her now?"
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   My guess would be, based upon your writing me this email,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   you're investing in her by being with her. That's the thing that
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   I would dearly love to see every mom in the world do, is be with your babies.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Because you could have all the money in the world
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   but if you're not with your baby for those first few years, she
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   will forever be behind. No matter how much money you save for college,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   be with your baby in those first few years. The first
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   five years are so formative in her life. If it costs you money, if you can't
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   put money in a Roth IRA because you're with your baby, fine. You're investing
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   in your daughter. Now, if that doesn't work, hire a grandma, hire a family
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   member, a trusted family member, so that she can be in that family environment
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   instead of in an institutional environment. That'll pay
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   off much bigger dividends than being institutionalized
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   at an early age. Go down the list. Meet her educational
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   needs. Hired, again, I don't need to repeat.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   At some point I'll get that course done. But those are some thoughts to cover.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   I'm going to answer part two of Chloe's question.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   This will be a part where this is not strictly going to be financial
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   although I'm going to cover finances a little bit in my answer. But those of you who get annoyed
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   when I dig into non-financial topics, this
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   is a time for you to tune out. Chloe continues her question. It says this, "I also have a spiritual
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   question, but I'm not sure if you take questions like that. It seems you're a Christian and possibly a pastor.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Your take on things reminds me a lot of my father, and he passed away from cancer 10 years ago.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   I'd really like some guidance on this particular topic. I've been extremely hurt
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   by the abortion laws and the expansion and acceptance of abortions by women in the
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   United States. I can't even think about the new law in New York without crying
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   and the utter disbelief that I live in a country where it is allowed.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   I never ever thought we as a society would allow such a thing.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   I'm so disappointed in women's hearts that we have fought for this
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   right. There has been a heart change in young women in our country that I can't
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   understand. I'm 34, and almost every woman I know is in favor of
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   abortions. What puts me over the edge is when my husband overheard two young women
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   talking in a cafe, and one said to the other, "Ugh, I hooked up with this
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   guy and now I'm pregnant. I have to get an abortion ASAP." The casual
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   approach just blows me away. I just don't know how to deal with this.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   I'm so hurt about it and can't understand why God allows this to go on.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   I was just interested in your point of view and advice. Thanks Joshua. Best to you and your family.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   Chloe. Chloe, it is certainly
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   an extremely challenging question
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   and a challenging time. I'm going to just discuss it briefly for
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   a moment in a non-financial context and in a
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   financial context. I share
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   your sadness over
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   the recent changes in legislation in New York.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   When you watch the video of the New York legislators
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   standing and clapping, and you see the
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   Freedom Tower lit up in pink
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   celebrating abortion, it makes me cry.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   It really does. And I share your frustration at that
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   being the state of the country of which I'm a citizen.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   It's funny, I was talking with the caller earlier about
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   talking about other citizenship options.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   I have no, very little pride these days in
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   carrying a US American passport. So I share
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   your emotions on the subject.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   But a couple of things for you to
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   consider that I hope will be encouraging. I personally
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   am optimistic that someday in the United States of America
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   abortion can be fully abolished. I am an abolitionist.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   I seek the abolition of human
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   abortion. There's an interesting philosophical
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   debate there. You can search out the arguments between the pro-lifers and the abolitionists.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   But I'm happy to identify as an abolitionist. I wish
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   to see human abortion fully and completely abolished. And I
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   think that it is possible. It's not something that you should
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   give up hope. The reason I think it's possible is what I see happening
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   is a clarifying of the issues. Now where
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   the United States eventually goes is unknown. The United States of America
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   has the most radical, the most liberal abortion laws of any country on
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   the planet. They are far more radical and far more liberal than
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   European laws in various European countries and most other places.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   And it comes with a cost.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   But I don't think that the argument is
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   not unwinnable. For example, I come from a religious perspective
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   as I would guess you at least do some from your perspective. But I don't
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   think that the issue of abortion only has to be solved
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   religiously. I used to argue about abortion online
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   and it was interesting on Facebook. I used to debate with people
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   and go through the various issues. And I would usually use non-religious language.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   I usually would use non-religious arguments, more philosophical arguments. And I was
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   very gratified one time I had two of my friends on Facebook who
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   separately, privately, they never interacted with me in the arguments, but privately
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   two of my friends on Facebook wrote to me separately
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   and both of them are libertarian atheists. And
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   they both privately said, "I don't share your religious
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   presuppositions." But they both privately said to me
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   "I've come to see what you're talking about philosophically
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   and philosophically I believe that you are right
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   and I've changed my position to defend the lives of the
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   pre-born, the most innocent among us." And I was really encouraged by that because
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   I see that happening. I don't think that
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   there's no ability for people to come together or there's no
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   ability for people to adopt all the same worldview on this particular
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   issue. And I think that the difference, if you were to go back to 1970
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   '73 right? Roe v. Wade, the difference between then and now is
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   a difference of clarification. Where back in
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   1970, you could say "We don't know much what happens in the womb."
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   Or "We don't know much about a baby until it comes out." No one can say that today. And so
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   whether you look at it from a scientific perspective or from a philosophical perspective
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   the issues are being clarified. Even the latest kerfuffle
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   with the debate over the Governor of Virginia's
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   comments. The issues are being clarified.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   It's been very rare that infanticide has come into play
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   in the modern debate. The debate was always "Oh, abortion."
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   Something magical happens when the baby comes through the birth canal. And it's been
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   remarkable to me this week to see how even the question
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   of infanticide has come up into the debate.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Now, I don't yet see people publicly debating whether or not we should engage
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   in infanticide, but I do think that's the debate that's going to
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   be necessary. The best philosopher on this subject is the philosopher
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Peter Singer, who is a secular philosopher
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   and a professor at... I can't remember where he's a professor
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   now, I think Northwestern University or something like that. But he's a professor.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   And he's a prominent secular ethicist. And basically
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   he wrote a great book, a well-known book on
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   animal rights, which is very influential in the
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   animal rights advocacy space. And on the subject of abortion
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   his secular approach to the question is
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   that it should be perfectly, it's morally permissible to kill
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   babies because babies lack human agency. They lack personhood.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   And so that was his argument. And I think ultimately it comes
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   down to understanding the ethics. Of course, the Christian,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   the Jewish, the Islamic understanding generally,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   debate of course among certain sectors of those Abrahamic
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   religions. But usually... I'm getting
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   too deep into the weeds. The point is that even the debate I think is helpful
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   because it's clarifying to certain people. Now, just because a debate is
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   clear, just because something seems morally clear to you doesn't mean that you can change another person's
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   heart. Years ago I was down in Central America and I was
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   at one of the, I guess it was the Aztec temples,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   one of the Indian tribes down there where they would practice
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   human sacrifice. And I was sitting there just
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   clear as day, sitting there on the shrine,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   the thing that they built where they would do the sacrifices.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   I looked at all the...
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   looked at all of the signs
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   showing the history of the culture and all of that. And I was just sitting
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   there thinking, like, how can a people do that?
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   How can a people engage in human sacrifice?
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   And it was mystifying to me because I couldn't get myself there
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   emotionally. Today I can understand. And I would just
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   say, look around you. When people will put
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   their...it's not hard. We have millions
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   of examples in human history where people will put their
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   ideology, their
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   money, their career
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   in the modern world of mothers who abort their babies,
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   put their
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   crops or whatever over the lives of their children and the Aztecs. It's just not hard to see.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   And what I would encourage you is read your Bible. If you want to see the evil and the
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   sin of mankind, go read your Bible. And when I started reading the New Testament
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   more, sorry, the Old Testament more, I started to see, you can just
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   see how through the course of human history you have a
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   reliable collection of historical work that spans thousands of years
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   and talks with absolute candor about the changes
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   in people. And you can just see how it gets there. Now, what do you do about it?
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Here are my recommendations. There is a lot that you can do.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   You don't have to just get upset about it.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   You don't have to just get that. I think it's valuable to do that. But first
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   is you can reach out to people. And you can reach out to people
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   that you know. One of the things that I've tried to do is I've tried to
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   talk to people, to young couples. I haven't done it much, but just
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   when I could see there was a place, if there was somebody that I thought would possibly
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   abort their baby, if it were conceived, I'd try to say, "Hey, listen,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   if you ever need somebody to adopt your child, I just want to let you know that
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   my wife and I are here." And I feel like that's something
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   that a lot of us could do a much better job of. I even say it publicly.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   If you're listening to my voice right now and you are faced with
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   you're considering aborting your child, murdering
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   your baby. Because for whatever reason that you think,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   if that's the choice, call me. Find a way to get in touch with me.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Because there are millions of people just like me
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   who, if we were given the chance,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   we would absolutely far rather
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   dedicate our lives to caring for your baby than to see that baby killed.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   And so I think that's one thing that you can do. I don't know many people
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   that do that, but I think you should do it. If you're interacting with people, if you have a personal
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   relationship with somebody, you should let somebody know, "Listen,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   husband and I, we want you to know, not prying,
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   but if you ever need us to, just know that we would be happy to adopt your baby."
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   Now, is that a financial cost for you?
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   You bet it is. Is that the best thing you could spend
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   your money on? Absolutely. Drain your Roth IRA
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   and take care of the baby. It's a better
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   investment than anything else. So I
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   think that's one step that you could take. And is there a cost to it? Yes.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   But just think of how gratifying that would be to be able to save a life
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   if you have the chance. Number two,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   you can advocate for the pre-born with
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   people that you know who are... Sorry, you can advocate for
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   the lives of the pre-born, even if
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   you're not doing it in person. I've come across, in my
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   research on the subject, I've come across a number of moms who work together, and
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   they primarily work together
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   using social media. And what they do is they're
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   coordinated together, they go to Facebook groups
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   where women are talking about their forthcoming abortion, and they
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   start reaching out to the women. And they don't hold back, which I really appreciate.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   I think that people have, especially
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   well-meaning pro-life ministries, have taken the tack
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   that somehow if you're just nice we can stop somebody from killing their child. Not going to
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   happen if you're just nice about it. But the reality is
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   not everybody's conscience is seared. Not every mother is
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   as cavalier. And even the mother that your husband heard, "I just
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   hooked up with this guy, now I'm pregnant, I have to get an abortion ASAP." Even her conscience,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   she's probably braver in word than she is in reality.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   It might just...
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   It's very hard, it would be very hard
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   for a young woman today to publicly be against abortion.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   And so most people feel the peer pressure to say, "Well, you know, no abortion,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   no big thing, just a clump of cells, nobody cares." But you're a mother, Chloe, you know
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   that that's not the case. You know, it's not
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   possible. It's not possible to be a mother
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   and not recognize just the life
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   within you. If it is possible, it's somebody who has completely
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   seared their conscience. So the point is, I've found mothers who are very
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   diligent. They find mothers, they interact with them, they reach out to them, they call them,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   they help them if they need resources, if they're poor, if they don't have money,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   they work with them, but they don't hold back and they confront the mothers
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   directly. They don't always save the babies, but they have saved dozens
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   and dozens and dozens and dozens of babies.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   So there's something that you could do. Look for that. I think that's really effective.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   If you're able, I think there's a place for you to go and advocate
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   with mothers in person.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   There's a man in Orlando, John somebody or other, but I searched out his story
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   and I wanted to go and interview him and find out. He's an older man, I think he's a retired
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   pastor. And for the last, forgive me if I'm botching the details,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   basically for more than a decade, he goes to one of the abortion mills in Orlando every day.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   And he intercedes with the mothers who are coming there,
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   the mothers and the fathers who are going there for abortions. And all day,
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   every day, of course, people walk past him. And he reaches out to them, he preaches at them,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   he encourages them, he confronts them. Just all day, every day
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   he's there. And usually he's alone. And that's the thing,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   is that people who are diligent in this work, there aren't many.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   For all of the millions of people around the United States who are supposedly
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   pro-life, there are very few of us who are ready to go out and actually get involved.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   And yet, I think it's John Barrios or something is his name, you know,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   John has saved dozens of lives over the years.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   Dozens of lives. I think that
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   kind of work is appropriate. I would love to see
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   retirees, especially Christian retirees, stop this
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   pursuit of constant hedonism and
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   pleasure and use those retirement years for something that builds. It's not like you've
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   got to go into work all the time, but there's so much need in the world, so many
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   areas to serve. And that service can be done
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   effectively by somebody who doesn't have so many financial pressures.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   It's tough for a young mother, a young father with young children
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   to say, "Well, my work is I'm going to go down and I'm going to go down and spend
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   15 hours a week standing in front of the abortion mill preaching."
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   But with all the millions of
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   retired Christians all throughout the United States of America, you're telling me
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   that we're letting, you know, the one by me, how many
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   I looked at the statistics, but dozens per day. It's
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   incredible. And yet, you know, a couple times a year
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   at my local abortion mill, a couple times a year, some of the Catholic
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   groups come out and stage a silent protest and that's about it.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   So there can be no solution legislatively
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   until there's a change in the hearts of the people. There's no possibility
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   for legislative change until there's a change in the hearts of the people.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   And that's the work, what I would say at this stage. I think abolition
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   can be accomplished. I hope it happens in my lifetime
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   but there's a whole lot of work that has to happen before
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   legislation matters. Next to legislation though, the problem
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   with legislation, the legislators aren't serious about it.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   Pro-lifism and being pro-life is a flag
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   that Republican politicians wave because it gets them votes.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   They don't mean it. The biggest opposition to abolition, I'm
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   increasingly convinced is in pro-lifers. While we were traveling around the country
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   we were in another state and I met with a guy who was a former state representative
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   in his state and had run for governor of his state
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   in a very pro-life state. And while I was
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   talking to him, I had a chance just privately off the record, I'd always
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   run, questioned this. I'd always said, "No, it can't be
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   that the pro-life people and the pro-life organizations and the politicians, they can't be the
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   problem." And I just had a hard time believing that. How can
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   it be? How can it be that these politicians are the problem?
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   And one of the things that was so frustrating is you watch
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   what would the Republicans say? "Oh, we need to cancel abortion."
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   "Well, we need a Republican..." It's always one more thing. "Oh, we need a Republican president." "We need a Republican
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   House of Representatives." "We need a Republican Senate."
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   Well, what do you do? In 2016, the
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   voters go to the polls and they deliver a Republican House, a Republican
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   Senate, and a Republican president. What promises
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   did the Republicans actually fulfill? They didn't repeal
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   Obamacare. They didn't
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   defund Planned Parenthood, at the very least, not let alone talking about abolishing
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   abortion. They didn't defund Planned Parenthood. They don't do anything. They're either cowards
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   or they're liars, the vast majority of them. I think
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   it's good to recognize that to be the case. They're either cowards or they're liars. Because they don't
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   do anything. Even now, what was the vote today or yesterday?
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   They won't withdraw the United States out of the Middle East.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   You've got to keep endless wars to keep all the money flowing
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   right into the pockets of the people who own the companies, the big war companies.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   I mean, it's absurd. I guess I just say all that to say this. Don't worry about the
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   politics of it. You can't change the politics. What you can do is you can reach
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   out to your neighbor. You can go to those young women. And if your husband has a chance
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   next time, maybe just say, "Listen, you don't have
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   to kill your baby. You don't have to live your life with that on your conscience."
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   It will help. Beyond that,
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   I don't know. I guess there are many other things that could be done.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000]   Obviously, I would encourage you to think about
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   adopting some of the unwanted babies. I think one of the great shame that
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   U.S. Americans should feel in general and specifically
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000]   U.S. Americans that identify as Christians should feel is there are tens
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000]   of thousands of children
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   stuck in orphanages, stuck in the foster care system
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   without anybody ready to adopt them. And I think
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   that should be to our shame. With all the millions and millions of us who
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   identify as Christians, who are
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   supposed to love the unlovable, and yet our orphanages
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   are not cleared out, I think that should be to our shame.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]   We could not handle. If abortion were abolished today, and all of the babies that
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]   are currently aborted with chemical abortion, with surgical abortion,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   if abortion were abolished today,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   it would just be absolutely
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   there would be babies everywhere in the system. And that would be the worst thing that could
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   happen. But that would be a huge problem. Remember, go back and
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   if you're not familiar with it, go back and study the history
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   of the early Christians and understand where
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   things happened from. Why has abortion been opposed throughout the Western world when child
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   sacrifice was a central hallmark
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   of the world previously. Child sacrifice, what eradicated
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   child sacrifice? A lot of it is
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   Christianity is responsible for a lot of it. But that started with the Roman
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   Empire. You had the
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   temple prostitutes. The local religious temples where the
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   act of worship was to have sexual relations with a temple prostitute.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   That was the pagan religions of those days. And so of course, if
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000]   a temple prostitute is having sexual relationships with men for her job
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   there were lots and lots of babies conceived in an era before birth control. Lots and lots
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   of babies conceived. And those babies were unwanted. They were taken out to the trash pile and they were left
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000]   to die. And then in the night the Christians would sneak in, they would find
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000]   the babies, they would take them home and they would care for them. That's our heritage.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   And yet today, most of us are more concerned about
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   the boat payment and how we're going to make the boat payment than about the children
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   who are being left on the trash bin of history.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000]   We should be ashamed of ourselves. And we should work to change it.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   But it can't start with legislation. It can't happen with legislation.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   First, voting for current politicians is worthless. All they
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   want to do is change the terms a little bit.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   I'm not aware of a single mainstream Republican politician
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   who is willing to open their mouth and stand up and say, "I want to
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   see abortion abolished." And the reason why the state of New York made that change?
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   Because they're worried about Roe v. Wade being overturned.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   That was why the state of New York made that legislative change. If Roe v. Wade were
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   overturned at the federal level by the Supreme Court, they said, "We want to make sure
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000]   that we have the strongest abortion law so that when things go back to states' rights, then we can
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   do it." It's not about... Don't pay attention.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   It's too much. But anyway,
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   I just want you to say, "Chloe, you're not alone. There are millions of people who work just like you."
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   What I would just say is this. Ask the Lord for one specific place
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   that you can labor. One specific mother that you can
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   encourage. One specific mother that you can confront.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000]   One religious leader who's not speaking out clearly for the
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   abolition of abortion. One politician that you can influence. Just one.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   And then be faithful with that.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   But to close, by answering your question, you say, "I don't know. I can't
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   understand why God allows this to go on." A couple answers for that.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   There's the philosophical answer, but skip that. The answer is because
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   God is patient. He's kind. He's
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   merciful. He doesn't want anyone to perish.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   He's also an orderly God who set up an orderly world that
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   functions according to orderly laws. And we will
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   in the future bear the consequences of the great
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   public sin. Think back to the stain of
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   slavery on the US American system. Black chattel slavery.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]   Today, we are still experiencing
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   the consequences of
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   that great sin. In the book of Numbers,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   the Bible says, "The Lord is slow to anger and abundant
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000]   But he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations."
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   So, on a national basis, the United States of America will continue to reap
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   that. The Bible says the wages of sin is death.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   And as you see it work out, what you see is you see death spreading all throughout
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   our culture. Death at the beginning of life, death in the middle of
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   life, death at the end of life. Why are life spans across the United States
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   shortening up? Death. Why are suicide rates
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   launching up? It's death. Why are so many families...
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000]   I could go on. You're not alone, Chloe.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000]   There are many of us who feel the same way.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]   Time will tell how things
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   work out. The good thing is this. You can trust God. He has all things in control.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   There's nothing that's a surprise to God. He controls all things.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   And why he allows evil to continue in the world, the only possible solution
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]   to that is it serves his purposes. And you and I
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   may not be able to see it at this point. Usually we can't. We look at the disaster,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   we look at the suffering, we look at the death, and we say, "God, how can
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   you let this go? If you're good and you're all-powerful, how can you let this go?"
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   We don't always get an answer to that question. Sometimes we do.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000]   Sometimes, as time goes by, you can see some of those answers.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000]   Some of those answers will be veiled until eternity.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   But love God. Love your husband. Love your children.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   Love your neighbor. If God gives you a platform to preach from,
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000]   preach from that and be faithful where you are. And don't think it
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]   doesn't matter. Tell you this, the thing I'm most happy about?
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   Your love in your little baby girl. And the thing
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   that confronts death is life.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   One of the things that weighs on aborted mothers' consciences very
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   heavily is that they see another mother with all of her children
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   intact. They see a mother with three, four, five children.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]   They think about the ones that they've aborted.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   It's heart-wrenching for them.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   It's heart-wrenching for them. Now, thank God He can provide forgiveness
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   for them. And I pray that you would have the chance to do that. Unfortunately, I don't
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000]   often have a chance to be there. As a woman, you'll much more
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000]   likely be opened up to about it than I will ever be opened up to. But be
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   faithful in those things there. Love your children. Love your husband.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   Use whatever opportunity God gives you to reach out to others, to
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   confront others, and trust Him with the results.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   When you're in winter's favorite town,
