[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.780]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.740]   the epistle of Paul to the Ephesians in chapter six, reading from verse ten to verse thirteen.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.520]   From verse ten to verse thirteen in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.360]   Only, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might; put on the whole
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:47.240]   armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the viles of the devil; for we wrestle
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:56.220]   not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.680]   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.900]   Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.440]   evil day; and having done all, to stand.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.120]   We come back again to this most important statement here in this epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.140]   just at the end of the epistle.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:39.180]   "Henceforth," says the apostle, "this is the thing that you have got to bear in mind."
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.700]   And he proceeds from this tenth verse right until the twentieth verse to deal with this
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.540]   great and most urgent matter, confronting all Christian people.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.720]   And of course he is dealing with this fight, with this conflict, which everybody coming
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.700]   into this world has inevitably to wage.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.580]   We have so far been looking at it in a general manner, introducing it, dividing up the statement
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.100]   into its two main component parts, and we have also seen that there are subdivisions
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.540]   of those.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.540]   And then we looked at it still in a general manner last Sunday morning from this standpoint,
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.580]   that the apostle is pressing this upon these Ephesians and upon us, because it is clearly
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.940]   the only way whereby this warfare can be waged successfully, the only way.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.940]   Christianity is an exclusive religion.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.180]   It says that it and it alone is the truth of God.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.900]   That is the claim made everywhere in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.340]   It is not only the only way, but it does not need any help or assistance.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.700]   There is no need to add a little Buddhism or Mohammedanism or Confucianism or any otherism
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.380]   to it.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.300]   It itself is the way and it is complete, it is entire.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.580]   And that is why the apostle is urging upon these people not only to consider it but to
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.980]   understand it and above all to apply it.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.100]   So we come this morning to the apostle's explanation as to why he presses this upon
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.420]   them in this most urgent manner.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.740]   This is his characteristic, as I am never tired of pointing out.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.240]   He does not just make statements, he gives reasons for his statements.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.560]   You see, you put on the whole armour of God for, because, we wrestle not, etc.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.340]   This is one of the most glorious things about the Christian faith.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.940]   You cannot reason yourself into it, but the moment you are in it, you find that it is
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.740]   the most reasonable thing in the world, full of understanding, full of explanations.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.740]   Christianity, unlike so many of the cults, is not just something which teaches you to
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.180]   persuade yourself in a thoughtless manner, that you just say a thing and go on saying
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.220]   it whatever may be true and whatever you may feel.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.420]   That is not Christianity.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.100]   There are always reasons given.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.420]   And the apostle here goes on to give us an explanation as to why he exalts us to be strong
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.860]   in the Lord and the power of his might and to put on the whole armour of God.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.860]   We need it all.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860]   Why?
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.340]   Well, he tells us here in particularly these two verses, 11 and 12.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.940]   Now it is to this that I want to begin to call attention this morning.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.580]   This is, of course, the most striking and the most remarkable statement.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.980]   I wonder whether anybody hearing this has a feeling at this moment, well, dear me, in
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.420]   the midst of the world as it is today, with conditions and situations as they are, are
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.660]   we really going to spend our time in looking at and considering what the Bible has got
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.700]   to say about the devil and about these principalities and powers.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.220]   Well, if you have such a feeling, all I can say is this, that far from being a realist,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.540]   as you probably imagine yourself to be, you are of all people the one who rarely is not
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.100]   facing the world situation as it is this morning.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.540]   There is nothing more realistic at this hour than what we are about to consider together.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   There is nothing in the whole world that is so urgently needed at this moment as an understanding
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.620]   of this very thing which the apostle tells us here.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.940]   Now I shall not mention the name of any statesman.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.180]   I shall not mention the name of any political party.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.660]   I shall not mention the name of any country or any political or social organization.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.800]   And yet I venture to assert that what I am going to say is more relevant to the condition
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.500]   of the world at this hour than all talk about politics and international relationships and
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.580]   everything in which the statesmen and their followers indulge.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.740]   Now I am making a strong statement there, and I am well aware of it.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.020]   But if you believe the Bible at all, as I am going to show you, that must inevitably
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.460]   be true.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.940]   We are going to deal here with the ultimate cause of the world situation.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.500]   And that is why I say that this is more urgently relevant than anything else at all.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.140]   I have often used this comparison; let me use it again.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:11.860]   What it seems to me that modern thinkers so constantly fail to do is to differentiate
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:19.060]   between a disease itself and the possible symptoms of a disease.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.020]   Now a disease may give rise to many, many symptoms.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.420]   Take any example that you like at random.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.980]   With influenza prevalent and so on, you may get pneumonia.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.980]   Very well.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.100]   The primary disease is, if you like, in your lungs.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.260]   Let that do for the moment as a rough definition.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.140]   But you will find you have got many other symptoms.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.620]   You will have a headache, you will feel flushed, you may have heartaches and pains all over
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.860]   your body, you may be sweating and so on.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.260]   Now you see there are many, many symptoms to the disease.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.240]   And the danger is that we should spend our time in medicating the symptoms.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.940]   You can take various things to relieve your headache, take some aspirin, and your head
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.040]   will be better for a while, but it won't make any difference to the pneumonia.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.900]   And so you can go on dealing with one symptom after another, and yet you will find that
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.860]   you are very busy and that you have to keep on dealing with a fresh one.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.860]   Why?
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.940]   Well, because the disease itself is the thing that really matters.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.300]   Now that's the whole trouble, I suggest to you, with the world at this moment.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.500]   Here are all these statesmen and others busily meeting in conference and quarrelling and
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   so on.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   What's the matter?
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.980]   Well, the trouble is that they do not realize the nature of the disease.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.180]   They have never understood the cause.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:47.100]   And of course, that is what makes the essence of the tragedy, that the Christian Church,
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:56.500]   which has got the message that can expose the cause and recommend the only remedy that
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.700]   can cure the tragedy, is that the Christian Church herself, instead of doing that, is
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:08.540]   half her time saying things which the statesmen and the politicians can say.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.020]   They do it, of course, because they want to give people the impression that the Christian
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   message is relevant.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.900]   And people, you see, only think that a thing is relevant if you are talking in its terms.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.620]   If you are talking about these statesmen by name and taking up these particular manifestations
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.420]   of the problem, such as bombs and so on, you are being tremendously relevant.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:34.860]   How pathetic it is, how tragic, medicating the symptoms and not recognizing the disease.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.180]   No, no, the business of the Christian Church is to get down to the root cause of the trouble.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.940]   Now, it alone can do that.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.420]   Nobody else can do that.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.620]   And it is because what we are looking at here is the only true understanding of the world's
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:57.380]   situation and what can be done about it, that I am claiming for it that it is the most
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:03.100]   urgently relevant message in this troubled world of ours this morning.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.900]   But, of course, as I shall proceed to show, it is something that is utterly ridiculed
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   by the world.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.940]   Very well, let us have a look at it.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.180]   First of all, the Apostle directs us to the fact of the conflict.
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.940]   You notice his terms, "we wrestle".
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:27.180]   Now this term "wrestle" causes the commentators a great deal of trouble, and of course the
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.780]   trouble arises in this way, that he starts off by saying "we wrestle".
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.700]   Then when he comes to describe the armour, it is something that has nothing to do at
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.420]   all with wrestling.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.180]   The moment you come to the details of the armour, you think rather of two armies meeting
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:51.260]   in conflict, and fiery darts, and things of that kind, and spears.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.460]   There seems to be a certain amount of confusion.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.540]   Well, it is very difficult to tell what the true explanation is of why the Apostle used
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.740]   this term "we wrestle", which he only uses here.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.120]   But it seems to me that the obvious explanation must be this, that he is anxious to show the
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.540]   intimate nature of the conflict.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.020]   While it is true, as we shall see, to think of the great massed battalions, the two great
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.340]   opposing forces, we must realise at the same time that it is an individual matter, and
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.260]   the notion of wrestling brings us immediately to that, two men grappling, as it were, with
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.260]   one another.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.300]   "We wrestle", so we have got to bear the two aspects in mind.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:46.140]   We are participators in this mighty spiritual conflict that is going on round and about
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.140]   us and in us.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.520]   Yes, but we are also, I say, individually engaged, every one of us.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.880]   We have not only got to watch as an army, we have got to watch individually.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.980]   I believe that he used the term "we wrestle" in order to show that.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.020]   But then he has got these other terms.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:12.980]   He says, "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against."
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.660]   Then he repeats it in verse 13, "Wherefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:27.820]   ye may be able to withstand in the evil day; and then, having done all, to stand."
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:37.860]   Now he uses these terms for one reason only, and that is to bring out the fierceness and
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.020]   the terrible nature and character of the conflict.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:51.660]   As Christian people, we are set in this tremendous conflict, wrestling, standing against, withstanding
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.420]   an enemy that's attacking.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.540]   You see, this is the first thing you have to do, you have to repulse the attacks.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.140]   And you have to go on doing it because he's there.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.820]   And then, even though you get a temporary victory, you don't say, "Well, it's all over,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:13.700]   I can go to bed now and go away on a holiday," not at all, having done all things, "to stand."
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:21.220]   The idea conveyed to us is this, you see, that this is a relentless war, that there
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.760]   is no discharge in this war, as the book of Ecclesiastes puts it.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.740]   But that as long as we are in this life and in this world, we've got to be aware of the
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.980]   fact that it is a fight and a struggle and a conflict.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.000]   This clearly needs to be emphasized, because there are so many people who don't realize
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.140]   that.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.260]   And not to realize that you're in a conflict means one thing only, and that is that you're
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:54.400]   so hopelessly defeated and so knocked out, as it were, that you don't even know it, you're
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   unconscious.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.540]   It means that you're completely defeated by the devil.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.360]   Somebody who is not aware of a fight and a conflict in a spiritual sense is in a drugged
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.260]   and in a hopeless condition.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.940]   And then, of course, on the other hand, the cults are always with us.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.160]   And the whole teaching of the cults, I don't care which of them you espouse, the teaching
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.580]   of the cults is always this, that you can be delivered right out of the conflict.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.580]   Some or another.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.540]   "Oh, yes, they say it's quite true, there is the problem, but it's all right, you do
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.580]   this, and all will be well."
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.780]   That's the essence of Christian science, you see.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:38.460]   There is no conflict, there is no such thing as disease, there is no such thing as pain.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.100]   These things are nonexistent, they say.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.700]   And then you keep on saying this to yourself, and you persuade yourself, and for the time
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.300]   being you feel very happy.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.780]   But you see how it's done.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:53.780]   It's by evading facts, by turning your back upon truth, by fooling yourself.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.460]   Now all the cults do that in some shape or form.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.420]   They want to give you the impression that you can relax and be at ease, no conflict,
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.420]   no fight.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.340]   Whereas the apostle says, "We wrestle."
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.340]   You're withstanding.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.260]   There's an enemy who's always attacking you.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.080]   And even though you get your victory, stand, make sure that you're still standing.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.600]   Always keep on your feet.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.780]   In other words, the difficult thing in this world is to keep on your feet, for there is
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.180]   an enemy who's ever threatening you and trying to knock you down.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:30.620]   Here is the task of life, here is the great business of life, to keep standing.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.040]   This is the apostle's representation of this.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.780]   It isn't mine, it is his.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.740]   He multiplies his terms, he repeats them, in order to bring home to us this notion that
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.220]   we are in the midst of a mighty conflict.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.220]   Now then, let's go on and see what he's got to say about the nature of the conflict.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:56.780]   And here, as is again not unusual with him, he starts with a negative.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:05.500]   Now as we come to this, we come to the very essence of the matter.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.060]   We are now coming to what I would call the essential and peculiar character and nature
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:17.340]   of the biblical message from beginning to end.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.900]   You see, there is something peculiar about the Bible.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.780]   There is nothing else in the world that has this teaching.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.860]   It mustn't be classed with any other book at all.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.860]   Why?
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:34.340]   Well, because not only does it differ in details, its whole point of view is different.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.740]   It is essentially different.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.660]   It is a peculiar book, special.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.460]   And this is the point, I say, at which it departs from every other teaching that is
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.580]   offering itself to mankind this morning.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.940]   Now look at the depth of its insight.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.640]   Look at its understanding.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.860]   That is the thing that makes this book to me so marvellous and proves it to be the book
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.220]   of God himself.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.760]   It gets down to the depths.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.340]   It really does go down to the roots.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.180]   There is nothing superficial, there is nothing glib and light.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.300]   It is the profundity of the book that establishes it at once as not being a human composition,
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.940]   it is indeed a divine revelation.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:30.440]   I am making these preliminary remarks because they are, to me, the most important thing
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.860]   that we can grasp at this hour, that in the world as it is at this moment, here we have
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:41.140]   got a textbook, if you like, that really gives us an understanding.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.300]   Nobody understands the world this morning apart from the Christian, if he really accepts
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.460]   this teaching.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:55.060]   So that I am here to say that this is a very essential part of the Christian message.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.980]   And I want to go further.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:04.460]   Our knowledge of this and our acceptance of this is a very thoroughgoing test of our profession
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.700]   of the Christian faith.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   Now then let me ask a question before we go any further.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.100]   Does this come into your essential thinking, that you may be able to stand against the
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.900]   wiles of the devil?
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.180]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.900]   Is this always in your thinking?
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.820]   Is this a part of your Christian philosophy?
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.740]   Is this always present in your mind?
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.940]   As you look at the world today, do you say at once, here is the explanation?
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.660]   Do you normally think like that, Christian people?
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:46.980]   Well, all I say is that if we don't, we have got a very defective sort of Christianity.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:53.860]   This is a vital and essential part of the Christian faith, the Christian message, as
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.360]   I am going to try to show you.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.860]   Now then, what does he say?
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.700]   Well, the negative first.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.940]   Why must I do all this?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.420]   Why must I be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might?
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.980]   Why is it true to say that no power less than that can enable me to stand, and the whole
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.780]   armour of God, every part and portion of it?
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.780]   Why?
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.180]   Well, negatively.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:23.300]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.020]   What does he mean by that?
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.100]   It is important we should be clear about this.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.980]   Those who are familiar with their Bibles will know that the term 'flesh' in the New
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:41.580]   Testament, and especially in the epistles of this particular apostle, is very generally
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.900]   used for the old nature, the sinful nature.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:53.980]   Not the old men, but the old nature, the sinful nature, sin residing within us.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.380]   Now, the 'flesh' is very commonly used in that sense, but it isn't the only sense
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.540]   in which it's used, and most obviously it is not the sense that is used here.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.020]   There need be no discussion about that.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.620]   The addition of the word 'blood' establishes it beyond any doubt, and actually in the Greek
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.340]   the blood comes before the flesh.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.860]   We wrestle not against blood and flesh.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.860]   What is this then?
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.020]   Well, this just means human nature.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.780]   It means men.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   What is a man?
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   Flesh and blood.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.300]   So, when he says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood," what he's really saying
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.420]   is, "We are up against not men only."
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.580]   Our problem is not that of men, or of mankind.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.120]   Flesh and blood, it's something else.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:52.660]   Now, here I say is one of these basic and fundamental propositions of the Scripture,
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.580]   and here we see how much it differs from the worldly point of view, even at its best and
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.420]   at its very highest.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.900]   The first thing you've got to realise, says the Apostle, is that the problem confronting
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:13.060]   you as an individual, and the problem confronting the whole of mankind, is not merely a human,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.820]   earthly problem; it's much higher than that, and therefore much more difficult.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:28.020]   Now then, here I say, let us see the difference between this and what is believed on by those
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.080]   who are not Christian.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.620]   The world, of course, doesn't believe this; that's why the world is as it is, as I'm
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.620]   saying.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.620]   It doesn't see this, you see.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.740]   It hasn't got the negative, even.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.380]   What then is the cause of the trouble, according to the world?
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:52.980]   Well, throughout the centuries, the world has tended to believe in various explanations.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.540]   Here are some of them.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:01.700]   Back in these times, when the Church was first established, the world then generally believed
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.140]   in the various gods.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.660]   There was a god of war, there was a god of love, there was a god of peace.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:16.260]   They thought that, and to this extent, you see, they had a certain amount of insight.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:22.660]   They thought that the world was being influenced and governed by certain unseen powers and
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.660]   forces.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:31.060]   They said, "There are these gods, there must be a god who shows himself in war, in
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.900]   all his power, but then there's clearly a god of love also."
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:43.100]   And so, you see, they felt that the one thing to do was to please and duplicate these gods.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   That is why you read that when the apostle Paul visited the famous city of Athens, he
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.660]   found it cluttered up with temples, gods.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.140]   And their idea was this, that as these gods had such influence upon men and his life in
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.460]   this world, obviously the thing to do was to put yourself on the right side of the god.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.300]   So you had to try to cover them all, so you had a multiplicity of temples, and you took
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.860]   your offerings to all the gods, and you offered them your worship.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.460]   Now, they believed that that was the cause of the trouble, and some of them believed
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:20.500]   in spirits, in wood and trees, and in stones, in the sun, the moon, the stars.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.700]   It's all a part of the same idea.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:29.420]   Polytheism, animism, all these things are just a recognition on the part of mankind
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:35.100]   that, well, there are other forces and powers that we don't see, but which seem to be
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.500]   having a very great influence.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:50.000]   Then moving a little bit from that, as men began to be more knowledgeable, they began
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.900]   to see that these were no gods, that these were obviously the creations of men and their
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.780]   minds and imaginations.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.980]   This was true not only of idols which they made with their hands, but they couldn't
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:09.380]   establish the reality of these other gods, and the whole of mythology, as you know, had
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.900]   such exaggerations as to make the whole thing ridiculous.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.860]   Then they said, "Well, no, perhaps it isn't that."
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.860]   "Well, what is it then?"
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.900]   "Well," they said, "you know, it's fate.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   It's fate."
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   "Well, what's fate?"
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.340]   "Well, nobody knows what fate is," they said.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.960]   "All we do know is this, that there seems to be something that is influencing us and
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.620]   governing us, and it's more powerful than we are.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.780]   If you're fated to do such a thing, you'll do it.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.340]   If you're fated that such a thing should happen to you, it will happen to you."
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:48.180]   Fatalism, this belief in some unseen power that we can't define, but which is obviously
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.700]   there governing circumstances and what happens to us—fate and fatalism.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.120]   The world has believed in that.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:04.260]   But speaking generally, by today I think we've moved even from that, although of course there
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.520]   are many who still believe in fate, quite obviously.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.500]   And there are many who believe in astrology and things like that, in this modern, sophisticated
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.780]   twentieth century of which we are so proud with all our education—astrology, the influences,
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.420]   the stars, the month you're born, and so on.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.020]   Now you see, here it's interesting, and I'm calling attention to it for that reason.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:34.260]   It's all indicative of an awareness in man that there is something outside himself which
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.740]   is making a tremendous difference to his life.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.100]   But the modern, sophisticated man, on the whole, doesn't believe in all that.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.580]   Well, what does he believe in?
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:52.100]   Well, his position is this, that there is nothing outside man himself, that the problem
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.020]   is really man himself and alone.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:02.420]   Now here's your typical, modern, educated, moral man.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.020]   He's not a Christian, of course not.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   Why not?
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.900]   Well, he doesn't believe in the spiritual world at all.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.620]   That's why he doesn't believe in God.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.220]   That's why he doesn't believe in the deity of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.700]   That's why he doesn't believe in the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.060]   That is why, of course, he doesn't believe in the devil and in the principalities and
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.220]   powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.820]   There is no such thing, he says, as a spiritual realm.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:33.940]   This, he says, is nothing but a kind of hangover from those primitive times and days and conditions
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:41.180]   in which people did indeed believe in spirits, in trees and books and stones and everywhere
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   else.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.180]   But we've outgrown that.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.380]   He says, no, no.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.060]   Man has been fooling himself throughout the centuries and fate and all these things and
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.260]   the nonsense of astrology.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.940]   Here's your modern rationalist, the man who governs everything by means of his mind and
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.740]   who believes that the sole problem is man himself.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.380]   In other words, it's due to man's ignorance, his lack of knowledge and of understanding
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.500]   and his lack of development.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.460]   I don't know what you feel, my friends.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:20.180]   I feel this is really the most urgent problem facing the world today, speaking generally.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:27.200]   Because you see, if you take this view, the spiritual realm is entirely banished.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.060]   But this is the position of large numbers of people.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:38.220]   Very well then, you say, if the problem is only that of man and man's ignorance and
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.760]   man's lack of knowledge, what is your solution?
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.420]   And they say, well, it's quite all right, it's a perfectly fair question.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.300]   And they say, we've got an answer to give you.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.740]   There are really but two things which are necessary.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.340]   And this is what is being preached and taught at the present time and has been the prevailing
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.380]   teaching for the last fifty years or so.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:10.580]   Progress, development, evolution.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.540]   Now they say, you needn't lose hope.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.940]   After all, they say, man is only on the threshold of the realization of his own greatness, his
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.940]   own glory and his own possibilities.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.460]   They say, look back, can't you see?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.180]   There has already been development.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.380]   There has already been advance.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.420]   We've already left animism.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.740]   We've turned our back upon polytheism.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.860]   We've got rid of a mere fatalism.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.720]   We really are now thinking.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   We are reasoning.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.500]   Man is really beginning to come into his own.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   It's inevitable.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.540]   There's some force in life, some ale and vital, some vital force.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.300]   You see, that's how they put it.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.460]   They're not fatalists, you know, and they don't believe in unseen powers, but there
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.780]   is in matter an ale and vital, some live force and power that's pushing everything upwards
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.980]   and forwards.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.980]   That's how they put it.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.580]   They're not fatalists, you know, and they don't believe in unseen powers.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:08.240]   But there is in matter an ale and vital, some live force and power that's pushing everything
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.860]   upwards and forwards.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:17.020]   This is the talk of the modern rationalist, who only believes in things that can be reasoned
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.780]   about and felt and touched and measured and handled.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.620]   You see, he has to fall back upon a vital force, force with a capital F.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   However, that is a part, as you know, of his explanation.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.980]   It's the part of the comfort he's trying to give us.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:37.080]   He says, don't be impatient, hold on, wait, there is this evidence of this advance and
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.380]   improvement and it'll go on and on and on until eventually all problems are banished
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.940]   and the world becomes perfect.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.980]   That's one.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.980]   There are many ramifications of that I needn't trouble you with them.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.260]   Communism is one of them, of course.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:01.340]   This dialectical process, materialism, capital and labour, supply and demand, it's all a
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.960]   part of the process we've got to go through until we arrive at that classless, perfect
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.460]   state.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:15.420]   So always remember that, that the real philosophic basis of communism is this whole biological
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.420]   view of life.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.420]   There are many Christian people who seem to me to be adopting the notion of evolution
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.420]   more and more.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.820]   Well, that's one of the results of doing that.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.000]   That's it in practice and in application.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.120]   And the other answer which they give is this, that in addition to this inevitable progress
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   and forward march, what we must do, of course, is to educate one another, spread knowledge,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.460]   apply our reason to the situation and get everybody else to do so.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:53.740]   And they say quite confidently that if only you do this, then our problems are really
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   going to be solved.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:01.920]   Now, can't you see, my dear friends, that this is a most vital and urgent matter?
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.460]   The world has really been living on this teaching during this present century.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.740]   This teaching is being given much publicity at the present time, that if only you can
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.200]   teach people and educate them and teach them how to reason, there'll never be another
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   war.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.700]   They'll say, "The war is ridiculous.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   We must meet together.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   Let's have a conference.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   Let's settle it.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.700]   I'll give this.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.700]   You give that."
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   They'll say, "OK, fine.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.700]   Sealed.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.700]   Settled.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.700]   All go away and we all live happily ever after."
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.440]   Now, they really believe that.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.500]   And the result is, of course, when it doesn't happen they're disappointed and they can't
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   understand it and they're bewildered.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.880]   But that is the prevailing notion and the prevailing theory.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.860]   So we are given the comfort of the evolutionary process and the spread of knowledge and culture
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.340]   and education.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:56.660]   It is to me almost beyond understanding that anybody who looks at the modern world and
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:02.780]   reads a newspaper can still go on believing that.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:11.220]   Indeed, if they never read a newspaper, how can anybody who's ever known an educated,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:19.580]   cultured, reasonable man who nevertheless fails drastically in his own personal life
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.500]   possibly believe such a thing?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.420]   How can they believe that wisdom and knowledge and learning and the ability to reason and
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:35.620]   to use logic is the solution to the problem when they just meet men and women?
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.540]   It's amazing.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:48.020]   But what I'm concerned to emphasize here particularly is this, that that is the exact
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.660]   opposite of what the Apostle here teaches.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.940]   And this is the beginning of Christianity.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.500]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.700]   Man isn't the problem.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.140]   The problem is not merely on the human level.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.140]   There is a problem there, yes, but those are the symptoms of the disease.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:18.580]   The real cause is further back, not against flesh and blood.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:26.260]   Now there I justify my original statement that it is the Gospel and the Gospel alone
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:33.620]   that holds out any hope for this troubled, unhappy world this morning.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:40.500]   You see, the whole basis of the conduct of affairs is on the supposition that we are
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:48.260]   wrestling only with flesh and blood, that the problem is man, and that the problem can
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:54.860]   therefore be solved by human, earthly, media, and ways and means.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.860]   It's man, flesh and blood.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.220]   They never rise higher.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.860]   The spiritual is never mentioned.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:06.700]   Now there is, I say, something that is absolutely basic.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:12.980]   There it's put negatively, but look at it positively.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:19.180]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, well, against what then?
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:30.300]   But against the devil, principalities, against powers—notice how he repeats this word "against"
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.700]   for the sake of emphasis—bad style, you say, what does style matter?
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.620]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers—yes,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.620]   your little editors, they'd knock out these "against," wouldn't they?—against principalities,
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.940]   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:57.260]   wickedness in heavenly places.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.260]   What is this?
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:05.260]   Well, here I say once more, you are looking straight into the face of what is most essential
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.900]   in the biblical and in Christian teaching.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.100]   What is the problem of this world this morning?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.100]   What's the ultimate cause?
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:20.500]   It is not man, it is the devil and his unseen forces and powers.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   That's the proposition.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:29.500]   Now then, this is the thing which we have got to analyze and follow the apostle in his
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.180]   great analysis.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.500]   Let us approach it therefore in general for a few moments before we close this morning
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.980]   by putting it like this.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:47.900]   Here is something which is not only not believed today, but it is rejected with scorn and utterly
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:57.700]   ridiculed and regarded as the funniest of all jokes—the devil, and principalities
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.740]   and powers, and unseen spiritual forces.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.380]   The modern man says that this is an insult to a man's intelligence.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:12.820]   There may be somebody thinking that here now, fancy in 1960, with a world as it is, a man
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:18.380]   really proposing to preach about the devil and unseen spiritual forces, it's an insult
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.100]   to men's intelligence.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.500]   Why don't you tell us something about how to settle the international problems?
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.300]   Why don't you start an agitation to stop the making of bombs?
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.460]   Why don't you be realistic?
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.940]   Why don't you be practical?
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   Instead of there talking about something, why?
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.180]   They say you're in the realm of folklore.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.940]   You're still manifesting the primitive mind.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.260]   You ought to tell us fairy tales.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.620]   Why don't you face the facts, the stark realities of life as it is today, instead
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.540]   of talking about some unseen spiritual forces and the devil?
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.660]   "Ah," they say, "this is behind the times.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.660]   This is nonsense."
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.800]   Now that's what's being said, isn't it?
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.620]   This is utterly and completely ridiculed.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.860]   But what troubles me much more is this, that not only is it being ridiculed by the world
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:14.700]   in general, which is not Christian, it is not receiving any attention, it is not being
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:22.060]   emphasized by Christian people, and even by many evangelical people.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.700]   They're all so concerned about that little sin that's getting them down, and they want
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:31.060]   life with a capital L and victory, that they never realize this great problem.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.380]   They're so introspective and subjective that they never look at the whole cosmos, the world,
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.780]   this tremendous thing that the apostle is here putting before us.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:46.900]   To what extent, I ask again, does this teaching concerning the devil and his powers enter
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.280]   into our normal, habitual thinking?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.340]   The apostle says you should never relax, you should never relent, stand always, be ready
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.980]   at all times, the devil and his powers, the whole thing, I say, has been ridiculed.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.460]   Now what is our reply to that?
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:09.160]   Well, let me just suggest some ideas like this to you.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:15.980]   This whole matter of believing in the devil and in these spiritual powers is, after all,
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.900]   you know, just the problem of a belief at all in a spiritual realm.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.960]   That's the fundamental question.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.260]   Do you believe in a spiritual realm at all?
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.060]   There are many who call themselves Christian who obviously don't.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.580]   They have reduced Christianity to a moral, ethical teaching.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.580]   It's nothing else.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.140]   There's no spiritual realm there, nor a realm which is above us, which influences us.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.540]   They don't believe in that at all.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.300]   They may say in practice, in words, that they do, but in their actual lives they don't.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.300]   They're not aware of the spiritual realm at all.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.000]   Of course, if a man doesn't believe in God, he's quite consistent.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.780]   If he doesn't believe in God, I wouldn't expect him to believe in the devil.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.220]   But what I cannot understand is a man who does believe in God and who doesn't believe
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.220]   in the devil.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.720]   What I cannot understand is a man who says, gets up in his church and says, "I believe
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.660]   in the Holy Ghost," and then regards the devil as a joke.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.740]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, but he doesn't believe in the evil spirit.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.400]   That's the man I don't understand.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.180]   He is utterly inconsistent.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.300]   He says he believes in a spiritual realm, yes, but only half of it.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.820]   He doesn't believe in the other half.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:30.220]   Oh, yes, what is involved here is our whole attitude towards a spiritual realm that is
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.740]   above us and outside us.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:37.260]   Or, let me put it like this, for you to see what exactly you do if you don't believe in
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.100]   the devil and these spiritual powers, or if you're not certain about this.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.640]   The problem really, you know, is not a belief in the devil, it's a belief in the authority
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.500]   of the scripture.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.020]   That's what it comes to.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.180]   Because other people, they don't believe the Bible is the Word of God, they reject the
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.620]   virgin birth, they reject the miracles, they reject the atonement, they reject the personality
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:06.780]   So, I'm not a bit surprised that they reject the devil and the forces of the devil.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   Why?
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.660]   Well, because, you see, their attitude is this.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.860]   Here they are, they're educated, they're cultured, they're learned, they're 1960 men, and they
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.060]   come to this old book.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.940]   "Of course," they say, "it's such an old book, you know, and it's a book like every other
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.620]   book, and a lot of rubbish in it, a lot of error in it.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.380]   People put in what was believed at the time, of course, we know now that that's not true."
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.220]   So, you see, they come as the authorities, the book is not the authority, they're the
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.220]   authority.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.180]   Out goes this, out goes that, out goes Holy Spirit, out goes devil, all these things.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.180]   What's left?
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.820]   Oh, well, simply what I can understand and what I believe to be true.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.660]   I am the authority, my reason.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.340]   That's what you're up against.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.900]   It isn't a mere matter of believing in the devil, you know.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.860]   It's your whole attitude towards the Scripture.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.860]   Why do I say that?
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:59.740]   Well, for this reason, that this teaching about the devil and his forces is an essential,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.900]   vital part of the biblical teaching.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:07.580]   It is found everywhere from Genesis to Revelation, and especially in Genesis and in Revelation.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.660]   But it's everywhere else.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.340]   Our Lord himself taught it.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.860]   And if you believe in him and in his teaching, you've got to believe in what he said about
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.820]   the devil and his powers.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:24.340]   So you see, we are fundamentally face to face with this belief in the Bible as our only
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:30.220]   revelation and authority, or a trusting to ourselves and our own understanding, miserable
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:35.780]   worms that we are, making such a mess of our world with our great minds and understanding
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.260]   that can go into the spiritual and say what's there and what isn't there, how ridiculous
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.900]   it all is.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.500]   But wait a moment.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   A belief in the devil and his powers is an absolute necessity to a belief in the biblical
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.380]   teaching concerning sin and evil.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.980]   You can't really believe the biblical doctrine concerning sin unless you believe in the devil
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   and his forces.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:07.680]   Fifthly, I go on to say this, that a belief in the devil and his forces is absolutely
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.420]   essential to a true understanding of the biblical doctrine of salvation.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.980]   Ah, but you say, it can't be.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.140]   I believe Christ died for my sins upon the cross.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.740]   Well, all right, my friend, that's quite right.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.240]   But tell me, why did he have to come?
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.780]   What was he really doing on the cross?
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.140]   According to the apostle Paul, he was there putting principalities and powers to an open
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:38.780]   shame, triumphing over them in it.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.220]   Why did Christ have to come?
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.220]   Well, one of his answers was this, he said, "The strong man armed keepeth his goods at
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:49.720]   peace, but when a stronger than he cometh, he despoileth him of his armor in which he
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   trusteth."
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.380]   Don't think that you can understand the biblical doctrine of salvation and reject the devil.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.480]   You cannot.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.640]   You haven't got the true doctrine of salvation if you don't believe in the devil and his
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   powers.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   You've got a little psychological treatment for yourself which makes you feel happy because
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.260]   you think your sins are forgiven.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.240]   But you haven't understood the essence of why Christ came and what he had to do, and
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.960]   the fight and the conflict, and the agony in the garden, and the temptations, and all
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   the rest of it.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.120]   That's no meaning to you, it can't have.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.840]   So you haven't got a full gospel, if you've got a gospel at all.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:37.640]   Then sixthly and lastly, I assert once more that you simply cannot understand the history
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:47.400]   in the Bible, the whole history of the world from the dawn of civilization until this morning.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:54.520]   You cannot understand modern history and what's happening in the world today, the confusion,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.840]   the amazement that the world is as it is in spite of all the advance that we've heard
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   so much about.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.680]   You cannot understand that, still less can you understand the future or have any hope
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:11.840]   with respect to it, unless you've got a clear understanding of what the apostle teaches
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:19.680]   us here about the devil and the principalities and powers against the world rulers of this
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:25.360]   darkness, against wicked spirits in the heavenlies.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.600]   You say this is depressing.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   Depressing?
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.760]   I find this the most comforting, cheering, optimistic thing that I know of.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:38.220]   What is to me depressing is to be confronted by a situation that I don't understand.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.040]   If I don't understand the situation, I feel lost.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.560]   I was never satisfied with medicating symptoms.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.880]   I knew the patient felt a bit better, but you see the question is what's the matter
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   with the man?
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   I was ill at ease until I knew.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.740]   It's a great thing to know the trouble, to make a diagnosis.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.680]   And the moment you've got a diagnosis, you should feel better and happier.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.160]   You say, "Well, now then, we know what we're dealing with."
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.920]   I say this is glorious optimism, but thank God this message doesn't stop merely at the
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.460]   delineation of the character of the problem.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.420]   It does do that in this realistic manner.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.420]   It then leads us on to the source of victory and of power.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:25.260]   It gives us a view of history, which sends me home confident and assured, though I am
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:31.300]   standing against the devil and the principalities and powers and wrestling against these infernal
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.080]   hordes.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:41.500]   I can be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   I can be clothed with the whole armor of God.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:56.900]   I can withstand, and having done all things, still stand and stand with confidence, knowing
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:05.080]   that in him and in the power of his might, I am safe and that his final, ultimate victory
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.580]   is always assured.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.380]   Amen.
