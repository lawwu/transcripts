[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   What do you think that the strong version of the scaling hypothesis gets right and what does it get wrong?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   It's just the idea that you just throw enough compute at a wide enough distribution of data and you get intelligence.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.000]   Yeah, look, my view is this isn't kind of an empirical question right now.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.600]   So I think it was pretty surprising to almost everyone, including the people who first worked on the scaling hypotheses, how far it's gone.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.720]   In a way, I mean, I sort of look at the large models today, and I think they're almost unreasonably effective for what they are.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.920]   I think it's pretty surprising some of the properties that emerge, things like, you know, it's clearly, in my opinion, got some form
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.280]   of concepts and abstractions and some things like that.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.200]   And I think if we were talking five plus years ago, I would have said to you, maybe we need an additional algorithmic breakthrough in
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.960]   order to do that. But it seems that these systems can implicitly learn that.
