[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   A podcast listener named Caleb writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what do you do when
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.160]   you find yourself bored of reading the Bible?"
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:22.320]   I pray my little acronym or acrostic, whatever you call it, I-O-U-S, I-O-U's, and I say this,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.240]   only because I take unbelievably strong encouragement from the fact that the psalmist had to pray
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.740]   this way.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.840]   It isn't just the person who asked that question, Caleb, or me, who struggled with feeling excited
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.740]   about the Bible, but the psalmist did.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.800]   So here's my I-O-U-S, I incline my heart to your testimonies and not to getting gained.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.680]   Psalm 119, verse 36, isn't that amazing?
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.080]   That's amazing that the psalmist would ask God to incline his heart to the Word.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   What?
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.400]   You're not inclined to the Bible sometimes, Mr. Psalmist?
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.040]   Or O, open my eyes that I may see wonderful things out of your Word.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.180]   Psalm 119, verse 18.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.760]   So the psalmist can go to the Word and not see anything?
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.360]   It's like we can stare at a page and some days the pages are blank and we feel horrible
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.880]   because of how insensitive we are.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.440]   So we join the psalmist in praying, O God, open my eyes, and then you, I-O-U, unite my
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.400]   heart to fear your name.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.600]   Psalm 86, 11, where my heart is all fragmented, it's going in every direction.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.140]   I'm looking at a fly on the wall or hearing something in my driveway and I get distracted
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.720]   in a hundred ways and the psalmist does too and he's pleading, O God, get my heart together
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.800]   so it can focus.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.960]   I-O-U, and then maybe the most important one of all, satisfy me in the morning with your
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   steadfast love.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.540]   Psalm 94, verse 11.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.920]   So that's what I do, Caleb.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.200]   I join the psalmist in pleading, incline my heart, open my eyes, unite my heart, satisfy
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.600]   my heart, O God, don't leave me in this season of boredom or blankness or deadness.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.560]   And then I got a long list of other things I do, but let me just tick them off.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   I won't linger over them long because I think that right there is probably the most important
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   thing.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.760]   I look at things that the Bible says about the Bible to rekindle my love for the Bible.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.040]   Good, I want that.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.880]   And your words are inspired and profitable for every good work and I want that.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.440]   And your word awakens faith.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and I want that.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.640]   And your word gives life.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.000]   You're born through the word and your words are life.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.080]   To whom shall we go?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.200]   I want life and your words make me holy.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   Your word is truth.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.420]   I want to be holy.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.720]   Your word gives freedom.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   You will know the truth.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   The truth will make you free.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.520]   Don't you want all those things, Caleb?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.600]   Well, they're only found in the word of God.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.000]   That's the way I preach to myself.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.940]   So I'm preaching that way to Caleb.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.700]   So I look to see what the Bible says about the Bible.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   And then when I'm really in need, I read sermons by those who are not bored by the Bible.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.460]   For me, that's often Jonathan Edwards.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.540]   I come away from a sermon by Jonathan Edwards loving the Bible, wanting to see what he saw,
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.160]   wanting to feel what he felt.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   So let that happen.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.300]   Or go to church and listen to pastors who are gifted in opening the word by exalting
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.620]   over the word so that what they love in the word and see in the word kindles you.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.300]   And oh my, the list goes on and on.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.500]   But I'll probably stop there and say, "Caleb, you're not alone.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.860]   We all are up and down in the degree to which we love to read the Bible."
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.260]   And maybe the last thing I should say is, even when you don't feel like it, keep tending
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.860]   the garden like a farmer who has to get out there every day and pull the weeds and till
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.460]   the soil, not because that day the fruit is going to grow up, but sooner or later, in
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.860]   God's sovereign timing, it'll grow if you tend your garden.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.900]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   And for more on the IOUs, see chapter 9 of Pastor John's book, "When I Don't Desire

[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   Thank you.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.020]   Tomorrow, we'll look at the ageless question, "How do I change?"
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.660]   There's a myriad of things I'd like to change about myself, but how does change happen?
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.660]   That's tomorrow.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.660]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.340]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
