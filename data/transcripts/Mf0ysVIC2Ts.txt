[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.020]   Our next speaker, Jesse Mecham, is a personal finance expert seen
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.600]   on Forbes, Wired, New York Times.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.020]   He is the founder of YNAB, which means you need a budget.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.440]   He is the founder of the YNAB app and money method
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.380]   that has inspired millions to spend, save and live joyfully.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.600]   He's also the host of the YNAB podcast and author
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.360]   of the best-selling book, You Need a Budget.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.980]   Jesse started YNAB in 2004 with just a spreadsheet.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360]   Back then he was cash-strapped, newly married, college student trying to cover the cost
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660]   of tuition without going into debt.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.820]   So you're going to -- and by the way, you'd be amazed at the amount of people I speak
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.620]   with that have no idea how much they're spending.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180]   And it doesn't matter whether you're young or old, especially if you're going
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.520]   into retirement, you really need to know what your budget is.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.240]   So here's Jesse.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.640]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.160]   We could have saved Rick some time and told him that it's called YNAB.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.400]   So we lost about five minutes with him saying every letter, but I think we'll be okay.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.240]   Yeah, we actually don't -- we don't swear up here either.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.320]   So I don't say the word budget anymore.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.860]   It was a huge mistake, the biggest mistake of my life.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.200]   There was a while ago, I was driving north on Interstate 15 in Utah and we were on a road trip.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.580]   And I drive and my wife, she watches the road or naps.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.560]   And then I've got a bunch of kids in the back and they were all either asleep
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   or if they were like in the angsty teen age, they probably had headphones on.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.740]   They were just kind of doing their thing, you know.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.700]   So it was super quiet in the car.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840]   And I distinctly remember seeing mile marker 318 go by.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.180]   And I was, of course, thinking about money because it's kind of all I think about.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.320]   And I don't know why, I'm just -- I'm wired that way.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.740]   And about mile marker 320, I had this epiphany that's the most obvious epiphany of all time,
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.220]   not worth a story, where I realized that money, it's sole purpose, there is no other purpose.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.940]   The sole purpose of money is to be spent.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.900]   And you could say, "No, it's to be saved."
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.880]   And I would just say, "You're just talking about future spending."
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.100]   And then you would say, "Oh, yeah, you're right."
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.760]   You could say, "Well, what about when I give it away?"
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   And I could say two things, the next person spends it, the charity spends it, you know,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.940]   your neighbor spends it, whoever you gave the money to.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.840]   Or I could say, "You just spent it on the feeling of giving."
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.680]   Right? That might also work.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.620]   But either way, we just spend money.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.920]   All we do is spend money.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.760]   And when you start to think about money as only being, like the sole purpose of it is to be spent,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.100]   it -- all of the other cruft starts to kind of fade away.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.860]   And I think we get some clarity.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.160]   So where this session was supposed to be about budgeting and learning to save,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.960]   it's -- I don't say budgeting anymore.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.560]   And I'm offended that that's on the slide.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.180]   And we'll be the -- I'm just kidding.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.300]   I'm totally kidding, Rick.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.540]   Kidding. We just met, so I'm going to tease him, you know,
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.440]   a lot and -- yeah, I'll blame Alan.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.560]   I don't know who Alan is.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.280]   Are you Alan?
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   Well, Alan, come on now, you know.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   So we -- here's this next 25 minutes is me basically telling you my story of moving
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.920]   from a company that taught people how to budget to a company that teaches people how to spend.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.180]   And we've done it for millions of people.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.940]   It's so far so good.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.180]   So the interesting thing about spending, and if we talk about meant to be spent,
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.260]   I want to add one little bit to meant to be spent.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.080]   Meant to be spent well, okay?
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.260]   I mean, it's meant to be spent well.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.900]   And we'll get to why.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.040]   Actually, no, let's do it right now.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.300]   The main -- I'm curious sometimes when we think about money,
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.680]   we have pretty fancy definitions for it.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.740]   We talk about how money is a dollar.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.200]   And I'll say, oh, that's not -- you didn't define money there.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.980]   You just told me, you know, what a government-sanctioned money is,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.620]   is called a dollar or a currency or something like that.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.440]   And so then an economist might come at us with a smarter definition that I quite like
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.520]   where they would say, well, money is a medium of exchange.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.700]   And I like that.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.940]   I actually like that quite a bit.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.080]   Lately, I've been thinking that money is both nothing and -- I was going to say everything,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.960]   but maybe it's better to say anything.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.460]   Money is nothing because until you spend it, you just don't know.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.520]   So if you could say, well, Jesse, I don't know what that is, then I would say, well,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.400]   then we can probably call it nothing for now.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.900]   And you say, no, it's definitely something.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.300]   And I would say, well, what is it?
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.780]   And then you could maybe start to name it a little bit.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.500]   And so when people save, when they're told to save -- now, S.C., she taught us this saving is
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.080]   for a very specific purpose.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.960]   She's doing it right.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.860]   Many times when people first come and we're working with them, they'll say, well,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.280]   I was told I need to save money.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.020]   And they're just told I need to save.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.520]   That's it.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.000]   And so when they set up a savings account, and they're feeling really good
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.060]   about this savings account, and they put money in the savings account,
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.500]   and they're maybe even smart, and they auto-deduct it so that it can do the smart thing
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.200]   where they don't have to re-decide every time.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.740]   I thought two weeks was the right answer also on how long motivation lasts.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.480]   And so they're feeling good about their savings, and then someone smashes in the back window
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.260]   of their Civic and steals their radio, or their cat spills a lot of water
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.520]   on their laptop, or whatever it may be.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.980]   And so they have to -- and this is a word they use.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.880]   They say they have to raid their savings like they're Vikings attacking it.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.920]   It's theirs, but they act like they don't even own it.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.500]   So they use very negative words to describe accessing, using their money.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.080]   And we found that interesting.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   We call it the revolving door of savings and shame, where they put the money in,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.960]   and then for whatever reason, they have to pull the money out.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.720]   It's like the cat broke your laptop.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   You work from home.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.240]   You need the laptop.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.220]   This is a justifiable thing to spend money on, and yet they're like, "I just can't save.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.800]   I'm not a good saver."
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.660]   And what they're missing here is a little bit of what Essie taught us already.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.600]   Their savings needs to have a name.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.900]   Otherwise, money is just nothing.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:23.100]   But when we label the money, it starts to give the money purpose and starts
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.940]   to maybe bestow a little bit of resolve for that person.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.460]   So if I have lots of different names for my pile of money, let's just put it all
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.580]   in my checking account, and I say I've got 10 grand in there and $1,000 in each
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.400]   of these 10 places, and one of them is for the laptop, a Chromebook.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.500]   You can't get a nice laptop.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.220]   You get a Chromebook, especially with inflation.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.800]   My numbers are pre-inflation, so just go with it.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.220]   But when you need that new laptop and you see that this money is labeled new laptop,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.360]   there's no rating of a fortress.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.520]   There's no shame.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.840]   It's just, honestly, you feel a little bit like a rock star.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.440]   You're just like, "Look at me.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.720]   Am I a fortune teller?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.800]   Am I a little prescient?
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.020]   Should I play the market just a little?"
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.520]   No, no, of course not.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.000]   But you kind of feel like, "Man, I'm handling things."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.240]   The only difference was two people with $10,000 of savings, one person that's
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   named them and one person that hasn't.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.880]   Now, you might be a little more dialed in, and you'll say, "Well, it's my emergency
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.480]   fund," but then you know what happens?
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   You don't really know what an emergency is, and so the laptop thing happens or
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   whatever, and you're still like, "Oh, my emergency fund.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.920]   That was for emergencies."
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.160]   You just haven't given yourself the permission.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.520]   You haven't labeled the money with its purpose, and so until you label it, I
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.440]   would say that money is nothing.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.600]   That's perhaps a good definition.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   The reason it's anything, though, is why.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.140]   Why is money anything?
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.920]   Because I can pull money out and just literally have it be anything, a villa in
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.000]   Italy or a coffee, it's anything.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.880]   But to go back to the medium of exchange bit, I was playing with my son, my
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.160]   littlest, I have seven, so I have to kind of count on my hand and figure out the
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.640]   name, and his name is Brooks, if I recall.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.720]   Now, he's a fantastic little four-year-old learning to swim.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.840]   We're in the pool, and I was showing Brooks how if we both go underwater, kind
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.880]   of trying to teach him not to be afraid to go underwater, right?
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.120]   So I wanted to have a really good reason to go underwater, and the reason was I was
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.840]   teaching him that snapping, you could hear it really well, and I'm no physicist or
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   whatever a person would be that knows about water and sound, but he thought that
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.760]   was pretty neat, and I realized later, I was like, "Oh, water's a great medium for
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.160]   sound."
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.640]   We were way across the pool.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.720]   He's in that shallow end.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   I say, "Brooks, stick your head underwater," snap.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.800]   He hears it.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.360]   He pops up.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.280]   He's like, "I could hear it, Dad.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.040]   I could totally hear it."
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:14.840]   And if water is a good medium for sound, then money is a great medium for what?
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.800]   Well, we say, "Oh, it's a medium of exchange," right?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Exchange?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.680]   That sounds boring.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.040]   It's a medium for what, really?
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.880]   The important part of that definition isn't medium.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.480]   It actually is the exchange part, and I mean, we don't barter anymore, right?
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.840]   I mean, maybe we barter a little bit.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.000]   Maybe to optimize taxes, you might do a little trade here and there or whatever.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.400]   Maybe we barter slightly, but I didn't buy my house for 65 table saws, and a few
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.080]   of you could figure out what brand, and I'd say SawStop, and you're like, "Oh,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.600]   that was smart," you know?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.000]   That one's smart.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.360]   And then a few of you would be like, "65?
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.120]   Okay.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.640]   I know how much that house costs in terms of dollars," right?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.520]   That's what you get to.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.800]   And if we were really to work hard, we could all get together and we could make
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.320]   these massive lists, this item exchange for this item, this item exchange for this
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   item, and we're trying to figure out the denominator for all of these different
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.000]   things, so a house is 65 table saws or whatever else it may be, but it becomes
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.800]   unwieldy, obviously, and so all humans forever have always just gotten rid of
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   the bartering quickly, and they've recognized we've got to figure out a
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.400]   medium of exchange, but the denominator is such an interesting question.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:34.320]   So when I exchange, like I've got a burrito numerator and then $10 or 20 in
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.120]   this day for the burrito, right, and it's like, "You better have guac on that for
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.080]   20 bucks," but the $20 is the denominator, and so we're doing the exchange, right?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   Now, to kind of loop it back to money well spent, the spending exchange, 20
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.000]   bucks, burrito, that works pretty well.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   On the earning bit of the exchange, what's the denominator?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.400]   The $10 or the paycheck, right?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   That's our numerator.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.920]   And what are we exchanging for it?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.680]   And you all, you know this, like we know this, I'm here exchanging right now,
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   right, all of our money, not money, our effort, our time, our energy, calories,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.800]   worries, stressors, all of our, "Hey, get good grades," the entire time we're
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.000]   told, "You start school, get good grades."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.280]   Why?
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.240]   "So you can get a good job."
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   Why?
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.040]   "So you can make more money."
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.320]   "Study this in school."
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.840]   "No, no, don't study that, study this."
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   No one gets paid doing that.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.960]   "Study this instead."
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.600]   "Why, dad?"
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.720]   "I have two boys that started college."
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.840]   "You make more money."
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.360]   "Okay, so this is all for money."
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.520]   "Right, it's all for money."
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.040]   "Oh, have a good network, talk to lots of people, meet people that are further
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.840]   along, have them help you move along in your career, you know, so go to these
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.560]   networking events."
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.040]   So you're like, "Okay, so networking is important."
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   Yes, that network is important, all for money, right?
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.160]   "Get good sleep so you can be more creative."
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.480]   So, you know, "Don't be financially stressed at work so you can be more
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.680]   valuable, so you can earn more money."
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:19.040]   This exchange we do, blood, sweat, money, tears, calories, it's all for money.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.640]   That's that earn side of the equation.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   It's money at the top, numerator, and all those things I listed as the denominator.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.960]   And for shorthand, I would maybe say, instead of me having to, for the rest of
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.160]   this presentation, I have to say blood, sweat, money, tears, it starts to sound
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   kind of gross anyway, I think we should just say you, I mean, you think about this
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.520]   for a moment, like you all are here and all of your experience, this entire room,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.840]   all experience, whether you remember it or not, everything that formed you, formed
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.480]   every thought, I don't know how well that works, not a psychiatrist, psychologist,
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.320]   therapist, none of that, but all of it kind of rolls up into that moment.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   And then we go off and we earn money.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.880]   So what else could we say besides you are the exchange?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.840]   You are exchanging you for money.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:15.520]   And as uncomfortable as it might be, because not in this room so much, I don't
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   think, but in many others, money is a little bit taboo, as SC said, it's a
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.600]   little bit dirty, it's, I mean, we were told like, even in the Bible, like, "Hey,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.200]   the love of money is the root of all evil."
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.080]   And we have to kind of make sure we tell people, "Hey, hey, it's the love.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.280]   It's the love of money.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.240]   It's not money itself."
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.960]   We have to actually caveat even like, "Yeah, I like money.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   I like to earn money.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.160]   I find money useful.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   It gets me anything."
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.040]   Right?
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.600]   But we, we distance ourselves from it.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.720]   So we, we make it at best a chore, right?
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.200]   For you, an obsession, but you guys are so rare, you know, compared to the norm.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.960]   Like you, you may be, you're wired a little bit different to, to enjoy the
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.640]   pursuit, to enjoy the investing, the challenge, and it's, it's lovely.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.800]   But on the spending side, there's still just this little bit of, well, money's
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.440]   just a little bit dirty.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   And if pressed, you'll, you'll yield.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.720]   You'll say, "Well, no, I appreciate the fact that I can buy a house with it and I
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.760]   can provide for my kids.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.160]   And yeah, I do have to drive around in a van and it could be a Porsche, but my
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.000]   friends would be lousy.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.240]   I appreciated that quite a bit.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.440]   Um, I haven't tested it either.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   I think we both should and just see what happens.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.640]   Um, Honda Odyssey for the win.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:33.120]   Um, but this distancing from money, I, what we try and teach people is the
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.720]   opposite.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.280]   We try and teach them that money that you're trying to push away.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:45.640]   That is just, and only you, all of your effort, energy, expertise, network,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.040]   blood, sweat, tears, calories.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.280]   It's all you.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.760]   Why, why would you push it away?
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.640]   Why would you make it less than, why would you not treat it with, I
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.600]   guess, self-respect almost.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.840]   Couldn't I say that?
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.040]   Let's treat it with respect.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.600]   Let, with, yeah, self-respect.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.480]   I'm going to run with that.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:13.720]   So when we're talking about money being spent well, and we have this, it is
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.240]   dangerous to do public math, but if I recall, if you have two fractions, you
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.400]   have numerator, denominator, numerator, denominator.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.520]   And I said, numerator over here on the earning was the money.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.640]   And then you, all of you are the denominator, the exchange.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.400]   And then over here, we put the burrito, right?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.920]   And then we had the money also.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.880]   And if you have a numerator, denominator, the same, they're both
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.720]   money, we can just cancel that out.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.440]   So now we have you and the burrito, which feels kind of weird, you know?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.800]   So I probably should use a different example besides a burrito, but I guess
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.080]   what I'm getting to is the money kind of does cancel out and what you end up
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:03.200]   with is you doing everything you can to earn this thing, and then you, not you
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.760]   guys in this room, but most people telling me I'm just not good with money.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.960]   And the effort on the earning side, and then the disconnect on the
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.760]   spending side drives me absolutely crazy.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:24.400]   You have the brain surgeon that literally does surgery on brains.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.000]   Who's tells me I'm just not good with money and I'm just like, fix your brain.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.560]   I guess I, what else should I tell him?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.120]   You know?
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.920]   Um, it just, it gets me because you see all of the sacrifice all
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.440]   of the time, not with family.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.080]   All of those things were perhaps trying to get back as we look to retire, maybe
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.720]   a little bit quicker than the next guy.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.800]   We have these things we want.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.480]   Those very things are what we're giving up in order to get this money.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.640]   So what I say here is not anything to do with budgeting or saving, but when you
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:05.280]   recognize all that you offer for the earning, all I want is for everyone to
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.200]   also recognize that they need to put effort into the spending side of it.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.360]   And what's great about this is if that equation really is just canceling
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.880]   down to be, you know, simplifying down to be you, the work necessary for you.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:28.000]   Is to figure out what you want to spend your money on truly.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.440]   And one fun thing that we do at YNAB is we never, ever tell people
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.240]   what to buy, how to spend at all.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.360]   How dare I, I'd be telling them to buy clamps for their woodworking shop.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.440]   It just doesn't land.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.920]   Well, you know, but what moves me doesn't move you.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.440]   And my favorite thing is to hear people tell me the crazy.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.480]   And those that's Jesse saying crazy, the crazy things that
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.640]   they spend their money on.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.760]   Now, do they end up spending less?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.080]   No, they spend differently.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.040]   There's no such thing as a spending cut, a spending fast.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.640]   I'm going to cut back.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.480]   You're just going to spend differently.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.280]   You're going to spend money on some stocks and bonds.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.520]   Yes, because you know, you're going to spend it on something even better later.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.160]   Right.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.320]   And it might be a little bit of healthcare.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.040]   It might be, we were just on an Alaskan cruise in July and this lovely
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.000]   couple won the event of how many cruises have you been on?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.960]   They had been on 61.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.880]   I did the math thinking five nights.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.480]   That's that's I did the math back then.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.600]   I'm not doing it in front of you now.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.560]   Three, I mean a year, it's a year of cruising, like on a boat.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.160]   I lasted five days.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.120]   That was enough for me.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.080]   But, um, but I, I was watching them.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.640]   They love it.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.280]   They love something about cruising.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.440]   They just love not for me once every 10 years.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.800]   Cool.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.240]   I'll go not for me at all, but I could, I'm looking at their faces
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.840]   realizing they thoroughly enjoy this.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.760]   They really, really do.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.880]   And how dare I question at all their value placement on this is what we love.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.040]   How dare I, they spent all of that time, effort, and energy to earn that money.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.800]   They have every right to spend it.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.280]   They're spending of themselves.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.560]   And so what we teach people isn't how to save.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.760]   It's not how to budget.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.080]   It's how to spend.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.960]   We just teach four very simple rules.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:39.840]   We want people to feel the trade-off of if I do this here, I can't do this over here.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.680]   Um, as you mentioned, buy now, pay dearly later.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.600]   That's what I call them.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.280]   I never will just say pay later.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.520]   You always have to say, buy now, pay dearly later.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.680]   And, um, we did a little funny April fool's video a while ago.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.240]   You know, there's one called after pay.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.680]   And so we, we launched a fake product called, uh, well, there it was called
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.240]   before pay, you know, like, Hey, uh, save up for it and then buy it kind of a thing.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.320]   Um, and that it just look up the video.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.200]   I thought it was funny, but, um.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.240]   We have all of these things, all the FinTech, like people will
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.160]   sometimes place my company in FinTech.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.840]   They'll say, well, you're a FinTech app because we use a computer basically.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.920]   Um, but we're, we're really an education company that sells
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.680]   software to keep teaching people.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.560]   That's what keeps us afloat, but we're teaching people a way
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.040]   of thinking about their money.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.840]   And a lot of FinTech, if I can throw them all with a large, you
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.040]   know, broad brush under the bus, a lot of FinTech is built for speed
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   because technology gives us speed out of the gate and it is built to.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.680]   Um, Distance people from their money quickly to have them not
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.800]   understand what after pay does to have them, to have things be a little more
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.680]   obfuscated, to have them not feel, to have them hear the Bing of Apple pay.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   That's been heavily engineered to be.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.240]   Oh, so delightful and to be fast and just to not feel it.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.360]   Now, should you spend money at Chick-fil-A?
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:11.960]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.840]   You mentioned Chick-fil-A.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.040]   I see.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.360]   So that wasn't, that wasn't for you.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.920]   That was for me, but should you spend money at Chick-fil-A and should it be
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.000]   fast and convenient if that's what you want to do, but if all of FinTech is
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.480]   trying to have you be unaware, unintentional, thoughtless about
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.720]   where your precious money goes, what we try and teach people is to have them
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.520]   be intentional and aware and thoughtful about where their precious resource goes.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.040]   It deserves that respect.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.760]   It deserves that little bit of intensity.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.800]   It deserves the neurosurgeon sitting down and saying, I spent 12 years learning that.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.280]   I think I can spend, you know, two or three hours learning this.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.320]   It really is helping people do the self work of figuring out how you will spend.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.480]   So while this is a beginner track where you're kind of saying, Hey, I'm just
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.320]   getting started and I have no idea where you're all at on this bogleheads journey,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.120]   but make sure, you know, at the end of the day, as you accumulate this wealth,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   and that is a fantastic thing.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.920]   As you accumulate this wealth, be very thoughtful, do the work necessary to
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:30.720]   know exactly how you want to spend that wealth also, it could be for inheritance.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.600]   That's lovely.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   It could be for some charity.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.680]   That's lovely.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.120]   It could be for 50 cruises.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.720]   That's lovely.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.120]   All of it is right.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.800]   If it's resonant with you, you did all of the work to earn it.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.120]   You did all of the work to spend it on investing.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.920]   I'm going to say, and you need to do some work, important work to figure
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.480]   out to make sure that resonance carries through where that money that
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.920]   you earned is also spent well.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.360]   Thank you.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   [Applause]
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.260]   you
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:16.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
