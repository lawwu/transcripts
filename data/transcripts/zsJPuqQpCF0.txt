[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   All right, so what do I want to do in my deep dive?
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.960]   Let me start first by just briefly talking
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.200]   about what this book is about, so we're on the same page.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.600]   And then I want to dive a little deeper
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.920]   into a decision I made writing the book,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.380]   and then an example of that decision put into action.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.840]   So what is the book actually about?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.360]   Well, the book is in response to something
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.880]   that had become increasingly apparent starting
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080]   around the early 2000s in a particular sector
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.680]   of the economy known as knowledge work.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.440]   So knowledge work has a sort of precise definition.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.560]   It's often defined as a job in which you are adding value
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840]   to information using your brain.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080]   But you can more informally think of it as a job
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.820]   where you probably look at a computer screen,
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.320]   or if you have a distaste for Microsoft teams,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.920]   you're probably a knowledge worker.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.400]   So there's something that began to happen
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.480]   in knowledge work starting around the early 2000s,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.640]   which was a growing sense of overload, exhaustion,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.520]   and then after a while, almost a creeping nihilism
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.040]   with work itself.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.120]   This idea of I'm here and I'm doing all these things,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.880]   but I don't even know what a lot of the stuff I'm doing means.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880]   It's a lot of email.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.800]   It's a lot of meetings.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.000]   I feel like I'm not even really making much traction
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.160]   on the thing that I'm ultimately hired to do.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.240]   This effect became pronounced in the early 2000s.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   It got obfuscated by all
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200]   of the other forces happening during the Great Resignation,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.720]   but then picked up a clear visible signal again
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.840]   at the end of that.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.320]   Really reached a peak in the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.360]   That's when we began to see it, not just anecdotally,
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760]   but also in the survey research data as well.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.040]   So one of the things I wanted to do
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040]   in this book was explore why.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.560]   And there's a few different major answers to this.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.320]   I tried to uncover an answer
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.480]   that I thought wasn't being included
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   as much in the conversation.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   So it's not a totalizing answer
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.160]   to why knowledge workers began burning out,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.320]   but it was an important piece.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.880]   And at the core of this explanation I looked
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.600]   at was a definition combined with a technology story.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.280]   So the definition that was relevant here was the definition
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.840]   of productivity itself.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.800]   So when knowledge work emerged as a major economic sector
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.320]   in the mid-20th century, right,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.560]   the term knowledge work was coined in 1959,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.040]   they had a problem, which was the definitions of productivity
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   that had been dominant starting in the agricultural sector,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.760]   followed by the industrial sector.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.000]   These definitions of productivity weren't applying
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480]   well to this new type of work.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.240]   The definitions of productivity that were reigning supreme
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   in agriculture and then later
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.040]   in industrialization were quantitative,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.160]   and they were ratio-based.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.840]   We have an input, we have an output,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   we have a clearly defined production system in between.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   We have this many acres of land,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   we produce this many bushels of wheat,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   here is the crop rotation system we're using.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   If we change that crop rotation system and that number goes up,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.160]   that's a better crop rotation system, so let's do that.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.800]   Same thing in factories.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.840]   We're producing this many Model Ts per paid labor hour.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.320]   If we change our production system from the craft system
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   to the continuous motion assembly line
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.520]   and that number jumps up by a factor of 10, oh,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.720]   that must be a more productive way of building cars.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.360]   So we had this quantitative notion of productivity
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.800]   which reigned supreme since Adam Smith first pointed it out,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   did not apply to knowledge work, because in knowledge work,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   there's not one thing we're producing.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   I could be working on seven different things.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.120]   Those could be different than what Jesse is working
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.800]   on at the same time, and they could be different
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.120]   than what I was working on a month ago.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.240]   To make matters worse, from a measurement perspective,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.280]   we don't have clearly defined production systems.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.760]   In knowledge work, unlike other types of work,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.000]   how you manage your time, how you organize your workload,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.720]   how you collaborate with other people,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   or even decide what to do during the day,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.040]   this is all individualized and obfuscated.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.480]   How I manage my work is different
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.800]   than how you manage your work.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.880]   There are no central levers to pull or buttons to press
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.320]   and see what happens when we do that.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's much more ambiguous.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.360]   It's much more haphazard than that.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.160]   So traditional economic notions
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.040]   of productivity did not fit well to knowledge work.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   And so what happened is we fell back on a heuristic,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.760]   and I call this heuristic in the book pseudoproductivity.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400]   And the core of pseudoproductivity is saying,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.600]   look, we will just use visible activity
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.640]   as a proxy for useful effort, right?
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   So we'll gather in buildings, we'll make office buildings,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.760]   we'll work factory shifts, and this way,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.040]   we can just sort of see that people are working.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.920]   And if we need to be more productive,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.000]   come earlier, stay later.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.640]   So pseudoproductivity was a band-aid.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.440]   It was an answer to this question of like,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.800]   well, how do we even manage
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.720]   if all of these sort of super quantitative
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.760]   Adam Smithian style notions of productivity
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.880]   no longer apply at the Don Draper marketing firm
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.720]   in the 1960s, what do we do?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.000]   Pseudoproductivity became the emergent answer.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.400]   So my argument in the first part of the book
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.080]   is that was OK until we got the front office IT revolution,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.720]   until we got network computers followed by mobile computing
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.920]   and laptops followed by smartphones.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.280]   And the combination of these two things, is my argument,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.600]   played a major role in sparking the overload, exhaustion,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.360]   and burnout crisis that began right around the same time
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.200]   that the front office IT revolution really hit its stride.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.040]   Because when you have personal computers at your desk,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   one of the things that happens is the amount of possible work
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.280]   you could do greatly accelerates.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.480]   There was a whole process of despecialization
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.600]   where the diversity of different roles
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.160]   in these knowledge work firms were reduced.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.120]   Because now any one person could do almost any job
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.000]   using their computer.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.720]   And so we could just have smaller numbers
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.680]   of people doing more things.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.400]   Low friction digital communication
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.360]   now made visible activity something
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.120]   that happened at a frenetic pace and a very fine grain.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.240]   Now all day long, I have to worry about visible activity.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.360]   I have to worry about an email that just arrived
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.080]   and making sure I respond to that in time
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.960]   so they see that I'm actually doing something.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.120]   This is why when knowledge work went largely remote
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.460]   during the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.200]   the sense that I'm busier than ever before became prominent.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.600]   Because we have low friction digital communication,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.440]   which was an even better way of demonstrating visible activity,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.800]   but it's also exhausting.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.440]   So this combination of the computer revolution
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.520]   in the office plus pseudoproductivity
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.400]   as this heuristic that we were just using by default,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.720]   I think that's what began to lead to the overload, which
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.360]   led to the exhaustion.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.600]   Also led to the sense of all I'm doing
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.200]   is performing around my work, but don't have enough time
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.000]   to get to the work itself.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.540]   So if that's one of the big problems,
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.760]   what do we do about it?
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.160]   We have to replace pseudoproductivity.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.480]   We need a more sophisticated notion
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.940]   of what we mean by productivity in knowledge work.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's going to have to be a definition that's less
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.400]   about activity and more about quality results produced
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.160]   over time.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.740]   And I make a whole argument in the book
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.560]   that this alternative that I call slow productivity, which
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.040]   I detail, could be more sustainable.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.300]   It could be work that is more meaningful.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.720]   And it could also be work that produces lots of value
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.600]   and is profitable if you're a for-profit organization.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.360]   The pseudoproductivity really was so poor of a choice
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.320]   that we have a lot of options to replace this
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.440]   with something better.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.060]   All right, so that's sort of the theory
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.480]   at the beginning of the book.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.440]   In the second half of the book, I explore lots of ideas
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.760]   for how to actually put that theory into action.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.200]   So this brings me to the decision
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   I made that I wanted to discuss when I was writing this book,
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.440]   that I don't know, I think it's interesting.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.560]   So I had this problem.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.760]   OK, part one is the theory.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   Part two is the advice.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.680]   I want to give advice.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.580]   What can we do?
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.660]   What can entrepreneurs do?
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.320]   What can people who work for a boss do?
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   What can small teams do?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.280]   I wanted to give concrete advice.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.520]   But I wasn't happy with what the most common modes
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.680]   for this type of advice had become in books.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.520]   I was just sort of--
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   not that they're wrong, I'm just kind of bored with them.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.280]   I would say one of the dominant modes
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.480]   for giving this type of advice right now
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.600]   is I'm going to cite organizational psychology
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.000]   studies.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.280]   Researchers from the University of Michigan looked into this,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.760]   and they found, paradoxically, that actually slowing down
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.720]   means you do better.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.220]   I mean, the research is interesting,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.660]   but I was sort of tired of building a lattice of advice
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.320]   on top of just organizational psychology reports.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.000]   So I decided not to do that.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.040]   Another common approach would be, well, let me just profile
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.840]   very specific people in knowledge work
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.280]   right now who are doing things differently.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.680]   But there, I kept running into a problem, which
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.160]   was the uncanny valley problem, where if I come in and say,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.520]   let me tell you about this particular knowledge worker,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.480]   the fact that their job is very similar to yours
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.800]   but not quite yours actually can be an obstacle that's
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.920]   hard to get past.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.440]   Like, that's too familiar.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.060]   So now I can really notice the ways
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.400]   this job is different than mine.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.720]   And now I can't bring the advice out of that case study
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.360]   because I just know that field too well,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.800]   and that job's not quite mine.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.680]   So the decision I made, which was a little bit unusual,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.440]   was, why don't I go and look at knowledge workers
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.040]   from times past who didn't work in offices
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.320]   and didn't work at computer screens
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.360]   and whose working lives in the concrete details
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.880]   actually look quite different than our jobs today?
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.760]   So no uncanny valley.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.880]   Traditional knowledge workers, we even went back historically.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.840]   We could talk about Mary Curie.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.280]   We could talk about Galileo.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.820]   We could talk more contemporaneously
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.640]   about non-office working knowledge workers
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.480]   like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mary Oliver.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.040]   I talk about all of them in the book.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   Hey there, I want to take a quick moment
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.880]   to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity,
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.440]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.420]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.800]   you're really going to like this book.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.720]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.240]   combined with step-by-step instructions
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.360]   for putting it into action.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.200]   So to find out more about the book,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.120]   check out calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.360]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.200]   All right, thanks.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   Let's get back to it.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   And my idea was, okay,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.400]   we'll take these traditional knowledge workers
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.000]   who had all of this flexibility to figure out and experiment
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.160]   what works and what doesn't
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.920]   when you create value with your brain.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.780]   And then we could isolate those principles.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.920]   What did they discover?
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.520]   And we can't mimic how they work,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   and we'll get to that in a second,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.980]   but we can isolate these principles
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.960]   and then use those principles
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.400]   to generate very concrete advice
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   for people who work in offices, for entrepreneurs,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.880]   for people who work in small teams.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.640]   So I was trying this sort of historical case approach
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.280]   in this book because I thought
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.560]   that principles could be more powerfully isolated
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.240]   if the context in which we were isolating them were novel,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.440]   that we weren't going to get tripped up
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.520]   in the Yonge County Valley.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   So I want to tell one of those stories now.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.440]   We're going to test out this method.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.420]   I'm going to tell one of those stories now.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.800]   We're going to extract a principle out of it,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.480]   and then we'll try to get some concrete advice
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.300]   out of that principle.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.200]   So we'll sort of do one example here.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.280]   So one of the stories I really enjoyed looking at
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.180]   when I was working on this book was Jane Austen.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.280]   So I had always heard about Jane Austen,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.560]   this idea that she wrote her books
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.180]   in small scraps of time on small scraps of paper
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.640]   in between all this other stuff that was going on.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.920]   It turns out this story, which is cited a lot,
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.980]   I tracked it down.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.840]   It comes from a biography, and I have the quote here.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.460]   It comes from a biography that her nephew, James,
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.840]   wrote 50 years after she died.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.240]   Here's the actual quote.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.920]   In his biography, James said about his aunt, Jane,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.640]   "She was careful that her occupations
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.840]   "should not be suspected by servants or visitors
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.360]   "or any persons beyond her own family party.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.400]   "She wrote upon small sheets of paper
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.300]   "which could easily be put away
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.420]   "or covered with a piece of blotting paper.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.660]   "There was, between the front door and the offices,
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.200]   "a swing door which creaked when it was opened,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.480]   "but she objected to having
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.940]   "this little inconvenience remedied
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.960]   "because it gave her notice when anyone was coming."
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.000]   This story got widely repeated.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.240]   Here is, for example, Virginia Woolf in A Room of One's Own.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.820]   "Yet Jane Austen was glad that a hinge creaked
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.480]   "so that she might hide her manuscript
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.680]   "before anyone came in."
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.400]   You can find similar quotes throughout.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.200]   I mean, I came across this story
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.800]   as recently as Mason Curry's 2013 book, Daily Rituals.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.460]   The problem with it is it turns out James made that all up.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.920]   That wasn't true.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.960]   She didn't write on scraps of paper.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.760]   She didn't hide her writing when people came in.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   If you go back and read the more recent definitive
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.560]   biographies based on primary sources,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.660]   a completely different picture arises.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.480]   Jane, it turns out, was way too busy to write.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.440]   And it really was a problem and a frustration in her life.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.080]   They weren't, she writes about these genteel houses
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.860]   where the visitors would come and give their calling cards.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.140]   They lived on a parsonage.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.280]   They were running a boys' school out of their own house.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.980]   She was milking cows and making jelly and jam
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.640]   for the boarders in their house.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.720]   They were very busy and she was frustrated
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.120]   she would write about this.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.300]   "I have all this stuff going on
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.800]   "and I can't find time to write."
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.340]   This went on for decades, right?
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.400]   She wanted to write.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.440]   She had these ideas for books that she had started.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.200]   She could not finish them.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.040]   What finally happened with Jane Austen
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.740]   is after her father died, her, her mom, her sister,
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.760]   and a family friend said, "We're tapped out.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.300]   "We're tapped out from the social life.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.620]   "We're tapped out from the work.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.420]   "We need to take a break."
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.040]   And they moved to a small cottage, Charlton Cottage,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.240]   which was on some land that her brother inherited.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.640]   They moved to this small cottage.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.140]   They're like, "We're out of the social scene.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.220]   "We're just going to sit here and just take a breather."
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.960]   Her mom started gardening
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.740]   and this was considered very scandalous
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.180]   because she wasn't a gardener.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.940]   Why would a normal person garden?
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.740]   But they were done.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.580]   They were done.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.160]   This is when she was able to write books.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.380]   So now that after almost everything was removed,
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.540]   this busyness was removed,
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.140]   I'm going to read here from my book here.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.220]   "Austen, for the first time in over a decade,
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.180]   "had gained real and meaningful space
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.280]   "to think and work creatively.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.300]   "It's here, working at a modest writing desk
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.200]   "by a window overlooking the road,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.940]   "that she finally finishes the manuscripts
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.080]   "for Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.700]   "before moving on to compose Mansfield Park and Emma.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.040]   "Austen's nephew may have popularized the story
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.480]   "of an over-scheduled Austen,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.080]   "prim and proper in her sitting room,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.580]   "working in frenzied bursts between incessant distractions,
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.360]   "but the reality of her remarkable years at Charlton
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.560]   "is clearly quite different.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.720]   "Far from glamorizing a surreptitious disciplined busyness,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.760]   "Austen's story, when told properly,
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.580]   "seems to promote the opposite of this approach.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.740]   "Austen was not able to produce creatively
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.160]   "during the crowded periods of her life.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.900]   "It was only when, through circumstance and contrivance,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.100]   "her obligations were greatly reduced,
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.160]   "that Austen was able, finally, to complete her best work."
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.780]   She basically wrote all of her books
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.340]   in like a period of five years and then died.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.040]   So it was sort of a tragic ending.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.200]   So what do we take away from that?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.680]   So now we have our challenge.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.800]   It's an interesting story.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.320]   It's historical.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.400]   It deals with productivity.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.360]   How do we now apply that to my job
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.080]   working at a marketing firm or EPA or a professor?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.960]   Well, clearly the takeaway message shouldn't be
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.120]   move to a small cottage in rural England
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.040]   and just on your brother's land.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.920]   Okay, that's not a story that most of us can replicate.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.000]   So what we need to do is actually zoom out a little bit,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.800]   like what's the key principle here?
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.580]   Well, the key principle in that story
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.660]   is that when you have too much going on,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.020]   it can sometimes be hard to really do anything.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.640]   When you're busy, that doesn't necessarily aggregate
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.940]   to the things I really care about are getting done.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.780]   Austen was busy,
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.860]   couldn't produce the things she wanted to produce.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.620]   Well, it turns out this exact same effect
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.780]   is, of course, afflicting the modern knowledge worker
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.700]   because what's happening to the modern knowledge worker?
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.020]   Well, if we decompose it,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.080]   here's what I think one of the big issues is.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.160]   We say yes to a lot of things
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.400]   because knowledge work is ambiguous.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.720]   We don't have systematic ways of managing workloads
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.520]   and people just email us and we don't wanna,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.720]   you know, we wanna show that we're pseudo-productive
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.600]   and we say yes.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.160]   But what happens when we say yes too many times?
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.800]   Each of the things that we say yes to
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.120]   brings with it administrative overhead, right?
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.000]   Once I say yes to this,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.160]   there's emails that have to be sent,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   meetings that have to happen.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.220]   We have to talk about the work, right?
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.780]   So if I've said yes to many different things,
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.040]   what's gonna happen to all of this administrative overhead?
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.640]   It's gonna pile up in my day.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.960]   And now the fraction of my day
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.440]   spent on administrative overhead
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.820]   versus actually working on the things that I agree to
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.480]   begins to grow and grow.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.960]   And it gets to the point where your schedule
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.620]   is so fragmented with meetings and emails and chats
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.360]   that there's very little time to get anything done
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.880]   and you have to work late at night
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.640]   when the administrative overhead dies down.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.800]   And the whole thing can be very exhausting,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.240]   make you feel like what am I really doing here?
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.280]   So there's a modern equivalent of Jane Austa being too busy.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.640]   So now that we understand that's the issue,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.920]   we can think about solutions.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.400]   And the solutions clearly becomes,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   oh, we wanna reduce the administrative overhead
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.440]   we're facing at any one time.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.800]   Well, one way to do that is to reduce the number of things
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.400]   that we're actively working on at any one time.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   So with less administrative overhead,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.720]   we can actually finish those things faster
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.060]   and with less frustration.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.960]   So if you're an entrepreneur,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.320]   that could be relatively straightforward to do.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.220]   Sequence things, work on this and do this.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.880]   Don't put them together.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.620]   If you work for someone else, it gets trickier,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.000]   but we have chapters in this book
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.320]   walking through how you can set up in a normal office job,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.200]   a workload management system
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.700]   where you just differentiate between
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.200]   I'm actively working on this,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.880]   this stuff is queued up for me to work on.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.180]   And as I finish these things, I pull in the next thing
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.320]   and there's ways to do this, it's very transparent.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.120]   And what it means though is that you have greatly reduced
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.560]   the number of things generating overhead.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.040]   It seems like an impossible dream,
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.200]   but then we find people who have tried this
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.640]   and they actually get away with it.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.440]   Their bosses say, the problem you're solving for me
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.640]   is taking this off my plate.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.840]   I need the trust you can do it.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.400]   Great, you have a system that works.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.760]   I can watch it march along.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   I don't need to hear about Jane Austen.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.640]   You're just, you're not a source of stress for me.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.360]   Great, I gotta move on over here.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.440]   So I use that just as a small case study,
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.560]   but what it captures is this historical method
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.660]   of we can actually start with the story
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.800]   that evokes a sort of intuition of something right
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.960]   or inspirational or interesting happening.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.000]   We can isolate the principle.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   Then we can use the principle as a lodestone
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.240]   to actually navigate modern work
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.340]   with all of the difficulties we face in these normal jobs
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.480]   and then use that to try to come up with ideas or tactics
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.080]   to escape the burdens of pseudo productivity
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.180]   that we care about.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.360]   So that's what I do in the book,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.960]   is a lot of principles isolated in that way,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.000]   translating into a lot of tactical advice
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.440]   that can then be sort of sifted through
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   and seeing what might work.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.280]   So anyways, let me leave my deep dive there.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.320]   As Jesse knows, I could talk about this book for hours.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   Jesse has literally heard me talk about this book for,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.920]   and I'm gonna, I'm not gonna exaggerate here.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.560]   I would say probably 750 hours.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.400]   Would that be?
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.300]   He does know all the principles.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.060]   (laughing)
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.440]   He knows the principles.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.280]   So here's what we're gonna do.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.520]   Let's switch over now.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.540]   Imagine sound effect, transition music.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.120]   Let's switch over the questions.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.160]   All right, I wanna take a quick break from our live show
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.500]   to talk about one of the sponsors
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.440]   that makes this podcast possible.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.840]   That's our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.200]   As I've talked about often on the show,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.720]   my wife and I absolutely love the Cozy Earth bedding.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.080]   We have multiple pairs,
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.280]   so we never have to go without Cozy Earth sheets
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.360]   while one pair is being washed.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.440]   We were actually just on a trip
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.320]   and it was the number one thing we were looking forward to
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.000]   was actually getting home to our Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.420]   They have other things as well.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.440]   They have leisure wear, they have other types of products,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.840]   but man, the fabric that they make these sheets with,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.560]   I absolutely love it.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.800]   You know, Mother's Day is coming up,
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.920]   so maybe this is a good thing to keep in mind.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.600]   Some Cozy Earth products.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.880]   I guarantee you whoever you buy these for,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.840]   they will like 'em.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.560]   All right, so here's the good news.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.480]   We have an offer here.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   You can get 35% off if you use the promo code CAL
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.360]   at CozyEarth.com, C-O-Y-Z-Earth.com.

[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.360]   All of their material or all their products
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.600]   also have a warranty.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.440]   Let's see here.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.360]   They have a 100-night sleep trial
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.480]   and 10-year warranty on all purchases.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.680]   So if you don't like it, you can send it back,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   but you will love it.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.400]   We now have not just the sheets.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.600]   My wife has some, I think, pajamas.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.480]   I got a Cozy Earth, I don't know what you would call it,
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.600]   like a sweatshirt, but made out of the same
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.560]   viscose bamboo material their sheets are made out of.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.400]   I love that.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.320]   I love that shirt.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.160]   That's fantastic.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.720]   So anyways, go over to CozyEarth.com.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.540]   Use the promo code CAL.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.600]   So after placing your order, oh, this would be useful.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.000]   After placing your order, select podcast in the survey
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.440]   and select my show, and they'll know you came from me,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.820]   and then they'll keep allowing, keep sponsoring me.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.360]   So if you use that promo code CAL,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.960]   also select podcast after you order,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.160]   select my show, CozyEarth.com.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.660]   If you don't have those sheets, you're sleeping on garbage.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.560]   I made up that tagline, that's not theirs.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.400]   Also wanna talk about our longtime sponsors
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.340]   and good friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.680]   You need to be using a VPN.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.920]   Here's why, when you are accessing websites or services,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.280]   people can see what sites and services you're accessing.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.320]   So even if the content of your packets,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.700]   if I'll use the technical term, is encrypted,
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.040]   the header is not.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.520]   So if I'm in a coffee shop browsing the web wirelessly
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.240]   with my laptop, anyone there with the right software
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.440]   can see what sites and services I'm talking to.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.100]   If I'm at home browsing the web or watching something,
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.480]   my internet service provider can see exactly what sites
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.380]   and services I'm talking to and they can sell that data
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.840]   to advertisers and you better believe they do that.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.220]   VPN protects you from that prying.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.680]   The way it works is as follows.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.640]   Instead of directly connecting to a site or service,
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.160]   you take that request, you encrypt it
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.440]   and you send it to a VPN server.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.480]   The VPN server then unencrypts the request,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.640]   talks to that site or service on your behalf,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.940]   encrypts the response and sends it back to you.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.000]   So as far as anyone who is snooping
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.800]   on your communication knows,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.160]   you're talking to a VPN server.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.780]   They have no idea what site or service
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.560]   you're ultimately trying to talk to.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.000]   You gain back your privacy.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.760]   If you're gonna use a VPN,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.080]   use the one that I believe to be the best in the business,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.060]   which is ExpressVPN.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.640]   Their software makes it very simple.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.140]   You just turn it on.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.800]   It runs in the background automatically.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.720]   You use your apps and your web browsers.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.780]   Just like normal, this all happens in the background.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.200]   They have huge amount of bandwidth
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.480]   and servers all around the world.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.700]   So you can get blazingly fast speeds.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.120]   So you're getting the privacy without any performance hit.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.480]   It works on everything you use to use the internet.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.860]   You can even get this running on your router,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.200]   your wireless router at home

[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.760]   So ExpressVPN has really got this figured out.

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.120]   All right, let's get back to the live show at People's Book.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.960]   - Thank you, Jesse.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.940]   Perfect.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.160]   Thank you, Cal.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.400]   Longtime fan, also a Tacoma Parker.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.880]   So, you know, love the hometown vibes.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.240]   I have two questions.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.840]   I hope that's okay.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.520]   So the first one is, in full transparency,
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.240]   I work at LinkedIn.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.960]   I am a big follower of digital minimalism,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   and I see you kind of almost like a pioneer, rebel, right,
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.440]   against our modern work system.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.080]   And I do feel like your voice is missing
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.960]   on the LinkedIn platform.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.220]   I see some people.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.760]   Cue for laughter.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.720]   - I'm not signing up for LinkedIn, is that?
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.000]   - But, and I know why, right?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.400]   I've read digital minimalism.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.640]   These are algorithmically curated,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.680]   you know, attention-grabbing machines.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.940]   They're excellent at it.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.720]   I see your YouTube videos, though,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.960]   and I've seen the Mr. Beastification of your thumbnails,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.480]   right, like I've seen it.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.800]   - We don't do our thumbnails.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.640]   - Oh, you don't?
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.460]   Oh, someone else doesn't.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.300]   Got it, got it.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.400]   So I do see you playing the YouTube game.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.420]   So I guess my question was like,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.440]   the YouTube game is being played, right?
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.960]   And I'm just curious, like, why not LinkedIn, right?
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.160]   So, so.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.000]   - I'm still not signing up for LinkedIn.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.400]   - Dang, okay, I tried.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.440]   Number two, listen to all your episodes.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.680]   First one, I'm a new father,
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.260]   just had my second daughter two weeks ago.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.560]   And there was, in your first episode,
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.680]   there was a question about busy parents, right?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.040]   And essentially the takeaway was,
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.120]   leave your house messy, that's okay.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.640]   I'd love more resources,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.720]   just some deeper answers on that.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.880]   - Yeah, all right, two good questions.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.020]   All right, so we'll do YouTube first.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.980]   So here's our YouTube strategy.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.000]   So to us, and by us, I mean Jesse and I,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.400]   so we thought about YouTube.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.120]   I think video is important,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.920]   and it's gonna be the future of podcasting.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.660]   YouTube is kind of a weird place.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   But there's an audience on YouTube.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.840]   So what we've been told,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.200]   the audience on YouTube is different
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.980]   than the audience listening to the podcast.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.600]   So it's a new audience, right?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   It's not, YouTube audiences do not carry over to,
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.040]   for example, podcast listeners.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.640]   It's a younger audience, for example.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.840]   And my audience, I like younger people.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.020]   So we have a YouTube consultant, Jeremy.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.280]   And the way we work is we say,
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.640]   look, we're gonna, we just record our podcast.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   We record it on video.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.340]   He says, I will put titles and thumbnails on them.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.740]   They're crazy stuff, right?
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.160]   Never stuff I would think to do.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.560]   And he said, this is how it works is,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.120]   this, the way young people use YouTube is like they,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.000]   it recommends things or something,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.180]   and you gotta get in front of their eyes
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.440]   so they can know what you're doing.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.820]   He's like, just trust me, we'll do thumbnails and titles.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.200]   They're pretty crazy.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.780]   But what I try to do is not,
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.120]   I don't even wanna know what's going on over there.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.460]   Like whenever I, YouTube,
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.560]   I don't like the YouTube algorithm.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.320]   If I pay too much attention to YouTube,
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.960]   and let's say like my goal
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.240]   was to try to get YouTube views up,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.900]   every one of my, here's what I would have to do.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.140]   Every one of my episodes, according to the data,
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.160]   should be about notebooks or why social media is bad,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.240]   because those get a lot of views.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.660]   So if I was being driven,
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.960]   if YouTube was my primary platform, God forbid,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.840]   there'd be a lot of like very fancy notebook discussion.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.600]   Fortunately, we see the podcast as our platform.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.840]   And so we give him our podcast to say,
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   you can put that out there,
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.120]   but we hope it doesn't go back the other way.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.880]   LinkedIn, okay, so the other question I wanna see parents,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   by the way, Reid Hoffman, he blurbed one of my books.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.200]   We're, I feel like I'm close with Reid Hoffman.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.920]   So we're okay, I think that's okay.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.460]   - I agree, I think parenting and productivity
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.100]   is a fantastic space.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.100]   I think there's room there for books just on that.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.540]   The thing is, I need to read that book.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.620]   I don't yet feel qualified to write that book.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.940]   So I'm hoping someone who has made it through
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.920]   to the other side of parenting and figuring out like,
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.060]   how do you run a household?
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:20.900]   I mean, Jesse, you know,
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.860]   we'll occasionally have these episodes
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.380]   where I'll bring on a guest expert and be like,
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.500]   just teach us about like,
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.460]   how do you run a family and a household?
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.140]   You know, how does those systems work?
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.480]   Those are just for me, those episodes, yeah.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.700]   We pretend like the audience is interested.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.200]   So I agree, it's a fascinating topic,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.480]   but I don't feel like I'm the expert on that yet.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.840]   Excellent, all right.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.480]   - Hi, Cal, I'm Clara Fang,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.720]   and I live in Germantown, Maryland.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.840]   Love your work.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.160]   I think one thing that sticks with me
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.320]   and I repeat to myself is your advice to do less, right?
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.260]   Do fewer things and do them well.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.760]   And I find that so challenging.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.900]   In this society time where we're just told
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.580]   to do more and more, you know,
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.620]   and no matter how much you're already doing,
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.200]   you can still do more.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.820]   I see you do quite a lot.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.660]   I don't know how you do all the things that you do,
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.540]   but I'll just use my life as an example.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.500]   I don't have kids even, I would be even busier if I did,
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.460]   but you know, I'm running a consulting company.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.740]   I'm working with a environmental racial equity
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.400]   nonprofit organization that has,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.800]   where I'm playing all the roles.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.500]   Like I'm the only staff person, so I do everything.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.020]   And then there are so many committees to be on.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.800]   You know, so you have to like be on the steering committee
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.200]   of this other organization,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.080]   be on the board of this other organization.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.160]   So it just seems like it proliferates
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.160]   and it's hard to figure out how do you do less things
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.480]   when everything seems important?
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.580]   You know, and plus like I also try to write
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.060]   and like Jane Austen, just not finding the time
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.740]   and don't know how you find the time to write so much.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.860]   I have ideas for books.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   I've been writing poetry since I was 20,
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.180]   but you know, it just seems like the time to do that
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.860]   gets less and less as I get older.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.960]   - Yeah, oh, I mean, it is the number one problem right now.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.180]   I would say it's like my number one thing
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.660]   I'm constantly fighting in my own life.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.380]   Like an important thing to know about this book
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.240]   is it's in part response to my audience,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   we're burning out, we gotta do something about this.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.000]   Also part in response to me just entering my 40s
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.080]   and be like, okay, I gotta tighten up the ship, right?
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.600]   Almost all of my books have that reality to it, right?
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.720]   If you look at "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.560]   a book about how do you cultivate careers you love,
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.880]   that's what I was going on the job market
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.920]   for the first time.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.120]   "Deep Work" I wrote as I was trying to get tenure
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.960]   at Georgetown.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.360]   So I was like, okay, how do you do this well?
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.560]   You know, digital minimalism,
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.160]   I didn't have much of a problem with my phone,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.240]   world without email was after I had tenure
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.480]   and all the service obligations fell on me.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.440]   And I was like, why am I on email so much?
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   So there's a lot of, I'm redefining self-help
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.000]   in a much more literal way, I guess,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.680]   when I think about working on these books.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.240]   I'll mention a few things I do with mixed success
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   in my own life, and then maybe some of that will be useful.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.920]   One thing I try to do is sequencing, right?
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.840]   So there's a difference between looking like,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.920]   doing a lot of things over a decade
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.360]   versus doing a lot of things on Tuesday, right?
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.880]   So like in my own life, I sequence,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.920]   like I'm in book tour mode right now,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.440]   so I'm not doing other things.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.000]   I'm not writing a book right now,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.560]   I'm not working on like a major academic project.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.880]   There's periods of my life
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.600]   when I'm really all in on book writing,
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.440]   but like I'm not going on podcast,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.600]   I'm not, I say yes to a lot fewer
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.240]   of sort of like service obligations.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.160]   There's periods where it's like department building periods.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.840]   Okay, this is like just working on,
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.400]   I'm the director of this at my department,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.600]   and like I'm giving that my attention right now.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.200]   I'll often stack my classes, for example.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.480]   I'm teaching multiple, all of my classes in this semester
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.760]   and none in that semester.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.720]   So in this semester, all I can be focused on
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.680]   is like I want to be a good teacher.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.160]   And then in this semester, I can be writing a book
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.520]   or working on, you know, an article.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.680]   So that type of thing has helped,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.280]   the sort of sequencing helps.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.960]   Over time, as different things finish,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.920]   you get a lot of things that rack up.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.080]   And then there's a thing,
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.640]   there's like sort of a temporal collapse that happens
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.200]   when you hear about, oh, this person did these five things.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   In your mind, you collapse and imagine those things
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.840]   all being worked on simultaneously.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.200]   But I try to sequence to a degree.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.240]   I also try to be really explicit about workload management.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.040]   Like one of the big issues with overload,
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.180]   especially in sort of the types of,
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.920]   there's like knowledge work type jobs,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   which are much less very strictly defined,
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.760]   is we don't have set philosophies
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.280]   for how do we keep track of what we're working on
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   and determine how much we should be working on.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.480]   We don't have these agreed upon ways of doing this.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.920]   Other fields do.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.040]   Like if you're a computer programmer,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.680]   they have these systems already
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.280]   where you really should only be working
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.060]   on one thing at a time and it's on a board
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.240]   and the other things go over here
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.720]   and we move the index cards around.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.920]   Like they really have thought about that.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   But we don't do this in a lot of other knowledge work jobs.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.160]   And I try to do it.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.520]   And I try to do it with things like quotas.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.240]   So with quotas, there might be a,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.600]   this type of thing is important for me to do,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.200]   like paper reviews.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.800]   But the number of potential paper reviews
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.840]   I'm gonna be asked to do is too many for me to do.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.340]   So I need to determine in advance,
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.280]   I do five of them per semester.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.120]   Like have a quota.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.300]   So it's like I'm doing this important thing,
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.360]   but I'm trying to think in advance
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.860]   how much of that am I gonna do?
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.600]   Same thing with sort of involvements with activities,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.880]   boards and committees, like outside of work.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.600]   These are important, I wanna do 'em.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.480]   But why don't I say I do two of them, right?
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.760]   So just starting to think through
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.920]   what is the load that I wanna do, that matters.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.960]   So that helps as well.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.820]   And then finally, this is the idea I mentioned briefly,
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.560]   but really having a dual category way
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.920]   of thinking about commitments.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.940]   Like the things I've said yes to.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.100]   Dividing them between I'm actively working on these two
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.360]   and these 10 I'm waiting to work on.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.800]   And as I finish something here,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   you bring the next thing in
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.200]   from the list of things you're waiting on.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.520]   You still have agreed to do these things.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.680]   But then if someone involved in one of these things
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.320]   is like, hey, let's check in on this or whatever,
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.920]   you can say like, oh yeah, it's not on my active list,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.880]   but it's moving towards it.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.980]   And I can actually show you exactly where it is.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.520]   So the idea is to prevent everything you've agreed from
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.460]   from concurrently generating overhead
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.080]   and trying to isolate the overhead
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.880]   to the small number of things I'm actively working on.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.060]   You throw all of these ideas at it,
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.640]   you still have too much to do.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.160]   But at least you feel like
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.200]   there's a bit of a handle around it.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.720]   So hopefully that's helpful.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.200]   The other thing I'll say is I just cycle on this
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.640]   and I end up having too much going on
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.720]   and then I get overloaded
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.080]   and then I take everything off my plate
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.360]   and then I get in trouble and then I bring stuff back on.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.160]   So we all struggle with it.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.760]   I struggle with it more than anything else.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.400]   But anyway, it's a good question.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.240]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.680]   - Hi Cal, my name's Allison.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   I am a burned out government lawyer at EPA actually.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.360]   I kind of have a question about the intersection
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.800]   between deep work and slow productivity.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.320]   I time block my day, I do my flow state in the morning,
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.060]   just like you say, and everything.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.280]   I have trouble getting out of the flow state
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.960]   and we can't completely eliminate
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.640]   our administrative overhead, especially in government.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.000]   And so I find myself in the afternoon spacing out
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.620]   when I'm supposed to be doing my meetings and stuff
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.700]   because my brain is still rubrics cubing
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.440]   what I was working on that morning.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.240]   Is that a feature or a bug?
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.920]   And if it is a bug, how can I,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.240]   I've tried taking walks between my time blocks,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.720]   but I can't get out of the flow state.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.800]   Oh, it's a very common problem.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.640]   It's a good question.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.880]   It's a very common problem.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.960]   The main thing that helps there
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.560]   is actually the ritual you have
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.120]   for completing the deep work block, right?
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.880]   So if you're good about, okay,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   I'm capturing everything I did.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.200]   Here's where, I call it recording state
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.080]   in my own practice.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.560]   Here's where I was,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.440]   here's what I'm gonna be working on next.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.280]   Like here's the next thing I have to figure out.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.840]   Sometimes this takes up to 20 minutes
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.600]   just to deactivate working on something
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.840]   that's cognitively demanding.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.480]   That helps because your mind then trusts,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.360]   we got everything down, right?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.680]   It's here, here's the state where we left off.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.720]   Here's what we're gonna work on next.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.500]   Here's what we need to know about it.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.240]   You know, Hemingway used to do this famously
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.080]   with his writing.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.720]   He would try to, he would leave it at a place
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.160]   where like he knew exactly,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.240]   he knew where to pick it up next time.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.000]   He didn't like to finish his writing
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.080]   at the end of a chapter for the day.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.400]   He liked the idea of, okay,
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.940]   I know exactly where I'm gonna pick it up the next day
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.880]   so I can just get started.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.480]   So a lot of people think about these shutdown routines.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.440]   I have to do that.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.960]   I have to record all the state about what I'm working on.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.580]   That helps.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.560]   It's still hard.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.480]   So then what I have to do is have a way
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.880]   to dump the ideas that pop up uninvited
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.580]   that are relevant to what you're working on.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.360]   I keep a plain text document open on my computer.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.220]   It's called workingmemory.txt.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.560]   And I just drop stuff into that.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.380]   And then at the end of the day, when I shut down my day,
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.220]   I can deal with it.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.680]   Like, what do I wanna do with this text?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.980]   So I just have a place that like,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.600]   when I'm in the middle of trying to do something else,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.440]   my mind's like, but what about this?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.240]   I could just get it out of my mind right away.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   But what you're talking about is very, very common.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.360]   Yeah, it's a good question though.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.660]   Oh, I've gone in the back.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.680]   - Hello, my name is Brielle Harbin.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   I'm a fellow faculty member,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.200]   and I'm saying hello and thank you on behalf of myself.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.960]   And also I have a writing group of there,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.640]   about 20 of us across the country who are all black women
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.160]   who are faculty members at universities across the country.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.760]   And we all have read "Deep Work."
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.000]   And I'm about to go up for tenure next year.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.520]   And part of how I'm going to get through it
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.660]   has been through "Deep Work."
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.840]   So thank you so much for that.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.800]   I read "Slow Productivity,"
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.560]   and we are actually gonna talk about it tomorrow
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.940]   in our group.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.480]   And one thing that stuck out for me is,
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.920]   one, I didn't know as much about "Jewel" as you.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.240]   As you told me a lot about what I know about "Jewel."
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.460]   - "Jewel" is an interesting story.
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.000]   - But I did know 5% of what you wrote.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.120]   And so one of the things that stuck out to me
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   was so thinking about the principle
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.680]   of obsessing over quality and the story of "Jewel"
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.520]   and how she didn't take the million dollar bonus,
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.120]   sign on bonus, instead perfected her craft.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.680]   But in that narrative, the story that you told,
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.600]   she ultimately was more interested in the art
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.320]   than in the fandom and the superstardom.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.640]   At the same time that I was reading your book,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   I was also listening to Beyoncé's "Cowboy Carter."
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.280]   And so I was thinking a lot about how that anecdote
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.440]   would have been different
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.960]   if you were talking about Beyoncé instead of "Jewel."
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.040]   If you are an artist, a creator,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.960]   someone who doesn't want just a modest career,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.540]   you actually want to break boundaries
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.380]   and you want to pioneer in your fields.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.560]   How do you manage?
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.080]   So you have given us the piece
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.960]   about obsessing over quality,
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.360]   but how you feel about it
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.480]   when your quality product is received differently
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.040]   and you keep going and you remain productive
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   even when people might not receive it
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.560]   as you have created it.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.280]   So I wondered if you could talk a little bit
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   about more of that emotional affective component of that.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.120]   - Yeah, it's a fantastic question.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.240]   I mean, first of all, I just want to mention,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.640]   I'm not surprised that the group was reading "Deep Work"
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.120]   or you find residence of that as you come up the tenure
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.160]   because I wrote that book
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.680]   as I was worried a lot about tenure.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.480]   So that like secretly a book about how do I get tenure.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.460]   Professors really resonate with that book.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.520]   I don't think it's a, it's not a coincidence.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.600]   It's a fantastic question, Beyoncé,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.160]   and how we compare that with "Jewel."
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.320]   So for people that very briefly,
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.520]   the story there was that "Jewel"
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.560]   had this super rapid ascent, right?
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.080]   She was living out of her car in San Diego
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.460]   and just doing these concerts at a coffee shop.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.080]   She just met the owner of this coffee shop.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.920]   The coffee shop was about to go out of business.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.120]   She's like, let's just try this.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.640]   I got to do these concerts here.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   And it just clicked, right?
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.360]   And the crowd did this exponential doubling thing.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.320]   You know, it's two people, then four people.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.720]   And within six months, it was record executives
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.000]   were flying her around
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.160]   and one of them put a million dollars on the table
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.360]   and she turned down the million dollar bonus, right?
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.520]   So what was going on there is that her ascent was so fast
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.880]   that she realized she didn't yet,
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.360]   she hadn't polished the performing skills
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.640]   to where it needed to be
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.600]   to have a successful enough album out of the gate
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.440]   to make back that million dollars fast enough
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.040]   that they wouldn't drop her.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.400]   She knew, okay, I have to work on this craft
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.640]   because she looked it up and she realized,
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.960]   they're not just giving me a million dollars.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.280]   It's an advance on royalties.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.520]   It's basically a loan
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.600]   and I'm going to have to record an album fast
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.920]   and it has to be a hit right away.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.240]   And I don't think I'm going to be able to do that
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.160]   because six months ago, you know,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.600]   I wasn't even performing professionally.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.120]   So she instead took a,
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.000]   she said, don't give me a big signing bonus.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.360]   She very cleverly got more back in though,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.800]   which ended up being worth a lot of money
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.320]   so that she would have time on the label
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.000]   to perform and get better,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.680]   to re-record songs, to try to find her voice.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.800]   And she had that time and then she got good enough
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.960]   that when she did take off finally,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.920]   she was ready to take off.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.160]   Beyonce, now I don't know Beyonce's story very well,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.440]   but I think Beyonce, by the time, you know,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.680]   she was really making her artistic moves,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.160]   she had this very, like a much longer sort of apprenticeship
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.000]   in some sense, right?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.600]   I mean, she had a super talented
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.200]   and performing in the group,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.040]   the multi-singer group, Destiny's Child.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.640]   She got, she had a lot of time to get really good.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.240]   Like she was very, very good.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.280]   And she was working,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.800]   she was performing at a high level
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.400]   from like a pretty young age
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.800]   and got really good and knew it.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.840]   So I sort of think about when she went solo
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.640]   and she made that move,
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.000]   it was from a position of, I really got this.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.760]   Like I've been doing this, I've been on the road,
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.680]   I know how this works.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.360]   I can tell I'm really talented.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.080]   I know how, I've figured out what I'm gonna do.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.840]   I have the experience for it.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.720]   And so Jewel would say like, once she got better,
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.000]   that's sort of what she did
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.480]   is she just decided what did she wanna do
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.800]   and then she started making those sort of, those decisions.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.680]   So, I mean, I don't know if you buy this or not,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.720]   but I would say that's maybe a shared feature
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.880]   to both of those stories.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's this idea of developing craft
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.760]   opens up opportunities to do all these
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.040]   like really interesting or effective or important things.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.160]   And Jewel just didn't, she didn't get the apprenticeship,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.120]   the lengthy apprenticeship before suddenly
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.360]   she had the attention of the recording industry on her.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.000]   So like her, I guess her great insight was to realize that
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.760]   and say, look, I kind of need another year here
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.240]   before I even know how to be on stage.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.160]   The real lesson here is that my idea
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.480]   is to make my next book a advice from the life of Beyonce.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.240]   Maybe I keep pitching that to my publisher.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.880]   They don't want me to write that.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.680]   - Hi Cal, thanks for what you do.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.640]   Name's CJ Overly, fellow Hoya and a project manager
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.680]   where in my role, I'm typically have three to five
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.320]   large long-term projects going at one time.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.160]   These are multi-year type of projects.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.400]   So they're throwing off smaller projects.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.160]   And I was hoping sort of, you could talk a little bit
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.880]   about applying some of the principles
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.440]   in that kind of a setting
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.760]   where it's a little more challenging.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.160]   So for example, trying to make my workload more visible,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.280]   right, externally, as you talk about.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.920]   Well, the project team on project A
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.280]   might not care so much about the workload
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.040]   being generated by project B, right, and vice versa.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.000]   So making that visible to them
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.400]   may or may not be super relevant,
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.920]   but of course it's part of the overall macro picture
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   from where I sit or another example would be
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.680]   thinking about how in that setting,
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.440]   you pick top three priorities
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.800]   when you sort of have to have three per project
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.840]   and they all kind of have to keep moving
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.440]   over the course of a given week.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.760]   So it makes doing things sequentially
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.200]   a little bit more challenging.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.960]   - Yeah. - Some examples.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.040]   - That's a good scenario
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.560]   because it gives us some interesting things to look at.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.040]   In that scenario, I'm just thinking out loud here,
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.520]   but in that scenario where you have more
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.920]   of a long-term engagement with these groups,
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.280]   like a bunch of different priorities are going to get spun up
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.800]   but we're going to be working together.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   These are all being spun out of the same major objective.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.240]   This might be a place where actually
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.120]   the book that's closest to you on the stand there,
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.880]   A World Without Email,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.960]   this book actually might have
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.120]   specifically relevant things to say here, right?
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.680]   Because in A World Without Email,
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.440]   what it focuses on is if you have, you know,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.560]   the time and space to actually think about it,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.960]   and when you have long-term projects, this is easier.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.520]   It's about how do you craft sort of collaboration protocols
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.160]   for whatever it is you're working on
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.800]   in these long-term projects
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.120]   to reduce the cognitive footprint.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.840]   And the main metric in that book,
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.280]   the key idea there is like,
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.760]   you want to figure out how to collaborate
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.560]   with your long-term collaborators
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.920]   in a way that minimizes unscheduled messages
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.480]   that require responses.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.840]   Like, so what you're trying to minimize
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.040]   is having to keep switching your attention back and forth.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.920]   I have to be on four Slack channels for four projects
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.040]   and we're going back and forth.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.800]   So it documents the neuroscience
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.200]   of why our brains can't do this well.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.800]   Trying to switch back and forth briefly
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.120]   between a lot of projects is cognitively exhausting
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.320]   and you run out of steam by like two in the afternoon.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.920]   We all know the effect where you're in here,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.680]   you're trying to clean out your inbox
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.760]   and you just eventually freeze.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.560]   And then you start looking for like really easy
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.000]   to answer emails.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.360]   It's because your brain is exhausted.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.040]   It can't switch context that quickly, right?
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.960]   So that book is about put in place collaboration protocols.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.440]   And it's all sorts of things about,
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   here's like the process by how we do this.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.680]   It's office hours.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.120]   It's, you know, this is,
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.200]   we have a particular like an email address for a project
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.280]   instead of using individual people's email addresses,
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.520]   all sorts of ideas.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.760]   And those can all work really well.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.160]   The relationship between that book and this book
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.880]   is that a lot of people who read that book said,
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   I wish I could do this,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.400]   but I have so many things going on.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.920]   I don't have any time to actually sit down
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.840]   and talk to people and say,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.920]   what are our protocols are going to be?
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.240]   I'm just drowning in all the stuff I said yes to.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.200]   So if you have a smaller number of very long-term projects,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.600]   it's probably worth taking the time to say,
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.360]   how are we going to actually collaborate
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.200]   when we work on these?
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.640]   And it's like a pain and it's friction
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.000]   and people want to just rock and roll
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.680]   on their slack or whatever,
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.920]   but it's very, very worth it.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.760]   If you're going to be working
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   for more than a couple of weeks with people.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.160]   So that, I think that book might have a lot of useful things
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.760]   for your issue right here.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.400]   - Yeah, it's an interesting study.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.800]   - Double makes heart.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.640]   - It's weird, right?
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   - Yeah, but I just wanted to say thank you
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.080]   for the books you write and the podcast as well.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.600]   Been listening to it since I came back from parental leave
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.040]   and it's a great just weekly reminder,
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.360]   like keep family and work in balance.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.200]   So thank you for that.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.800]   More of a writing question,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.400]   the kind of the getting things done first question,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.360]   but when you're writing these books,
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.680]   do you come up with your framework first
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.120]   and then find all these great examples
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.040]   or are you kind of collecting all these examples
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.760]   as you go along and then you form that framework?
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.000]   So I think just the number and variety of examples
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.360]   is so unique to your books.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.200]   - It's circular.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.560]   It's a good question.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.640]   So how do I, do I come up with the principles first
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.840]   or do I come up with the examples first?
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.800]   Typically I'm drawing from examples
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.760]   I've already come across
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.400]   'cause I'm always reading and encountering
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.600]   and filing things away.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.880]   Out of those begins to emerge sort of fledgling versions
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.920]   of the principles.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.800]   Then I go seeking specifically examples
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.040]   to further try to understand what's going on.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.600]   So like if you did a deep dive
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.320]   into the concept of slow productivity,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   you start to see inklings of it show up 2020, 2021,
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.720]   you'll start to see inklings of it.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.000]   I think I used a term like this in a blog post
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.320]   where I had read about Galileo
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.640]   and about like, wow, he really took a long time
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.080]   to do the stuff we think about him being famous for doing.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.880]   Like he sort of slowed down.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.600]   And then I had a New Yorker essay that was,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.160]   I used a title, like it's time to embrace slow productivity,
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.960]   but it was really just talking about workload management.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.040]   Like just that, I had a couple of examples there
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.760]   I was playing with.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.120]   The jewel, I had definitely gone on a deep dive
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.160]   in jewel before.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.760]   That example was just back there
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.480]   and I was sort of trying to figure out what that meant.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.720]   So it's very circular.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.280]   So they don't come ex nihilo, right?
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.000]   It's not just, I just have these ideas for three principles.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.360]   They come out of like things I've been looking at.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.640]   But then as I seek out many more examples,
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.680]   that's when I refine them.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.240]   And so you kind of get that circular refinement.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.360]   And the one thing I always tell people is I spend,
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.280]   frameworks are hard.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.080]   And like often I'll spend years thinking about them.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.360]   You know, it takes me about a year
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.920]   or like eight months to write a book,
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.840]   but often it's like two or three years
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.360]   of kind of playing with a concept,
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.800]   testing it on the podcast,
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.400]   trying to see like, is this resonating,
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.360]   testing it in my New Yorker pieces,
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.760]   like trying to see if it's resonating or not before.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.080]   So it could really take me years before I feel like
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.400]   something is ready to capture.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.840]   It's an interesting process.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.120]   - I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   about the team element of this
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   and how to put these practices and principles into play
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.680]   in the context of a team where it might be that
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.840]   everyone says, yes, we need collaborative agreements.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.560]   And then maybe there's a little bit of motivation
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   to have that first conversation,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.600]   but it is a very tangly process.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.480]   And I'm wondering if you can share some insight
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.720]   on how to keep moving that process forward
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.640]   and to get it to a place where you close the loop
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.720]   and actually start implementing the practices
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.000]   and principles on a team,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.880]   whether it's sequencing throughout a day or a week,
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.360]   and maybe particularly in the context of a remote
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.760]   or hybrid team stretched across many time zones.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.480]   So with teams, there's a couple of things that can help,
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.720]   but they're all built around the same idea of get a win.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.280]   Like once there's one win, like we did this,
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.760]   we all really love this.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.040]   Now the floodgates are open.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.680]   Like, all right, let's get together.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.200]   What are we gonna do next?
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.640]   So it's all about breaking that barrier
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.800]   to the first intentional change that moves you away from,
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.960]   the term I use for the standard collaboration workflow
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.520]   is hyperactive hive mind.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.280]   So like the default is just,
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.640]   we'll figure things out on the fly
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.640]   with ad hoc communication.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.560]   So like when you get your first intentional practice
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.360]   that everyone agrees on, that's not a step away from that,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.880]   it makes people really happy, right?
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.960]   And then like a lot of other things can follow.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.080]   So there's a couple, I'll give you two options
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.920]   for like potential first things to try.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.360]   One that I think, I profile a knowledge work team
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.920]   doing this in the book, is this idea of,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.560]   let's have a difference between stuff the team agreed to do
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   and what individuals are doing, right?
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.040]   So instead of just having everything that needs to be done
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.840]   has been just distributed among people kind of informally,
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.240]   like, I guess I'm working on this now
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.640]   because you emailed me and you're working on this,
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.200]   have a central place where like,
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.720]   when something needs to be done
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.000]   or we think it needs to be done, this is where it goes.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.160]   And the example in the book,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.920]   they actually were pinning these things on a wall.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.160]   They had a wall where their team met,
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.560]   this was at the Brood Institute in Cambridge.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.240]   And they just put on index card, put it on the wall.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.560]   Like, oh, we should do this, we should do this.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.480]   Like if someone, if something came up,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.320]   you'd have to just send a CCD email, like,
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.440]   hey, what do you all think about this?
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   Which is like, oh my God, like, what do I answer this?
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.640]   Like, yes, I mean, yeah, I hate that.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.440]   Put it on the wall, right?
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.440]   Then there's like what each person's working on.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.960]   And he made that separate.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   And they put that on the wall as well.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.080]   Like, okay, here's like the things I'm working on right now.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.440]   Oh, I finished this thing.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.760]   Let's look at this big pile or like, what should I do next?
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.840]   Like, what do we think about this?
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.360]   Like over time, it was like a good way of trying to see
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.040]   like, what should we really be working on or not?
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.160]   It got rid of that anxiety of like,
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.280]   whatever happened to this thing
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.640]   and I have to email each other.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.080]   But it significantly reduced administrative overhead
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.760]   because individuals were only working
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   on a small number of these things at a time, right?
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.640]   So I've seen that one work because it's pretty clear.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.160]   It's like, we have a Trello board and it's like,
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.320]   anyone can add to it.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.040]   Or we have like a Google Doc, like, let's work on this,
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.080]   let's work on that.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.400]   And like, here's the main things I'm working on.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.120]   So that could be a really big win
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.200]   because that feeling of reduced administrative overhead
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   can be really good.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.560]   Another thing that I've seen work for inducing changes,
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   this actually comes from my book, "Deep Work."
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.680]   But then I mentioned it as an aside
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.120]   and then lots of people tried it.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   And then they come back and tell me
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.600]   and it was surprisingly effective.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.240]   Was this idea, which this was more for working for bosses,
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.080]   but it could work for teams as well, was measuring, right?
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.760]   So like in "Deep Work," there was this idea
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.560]   of talking to your team or talking to your boss
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.680]   and saying, okay, like for my role,
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.920]   what do you think the optimal ratio, for example,
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.080]   like focused work and administrative work would be?
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.600]   For my role, it's gonna be different for different roles,
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.920]   but like what ratio is going to like produce
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.640]   the most value for us, right?
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.520]   And you get a number, 50-50, whatever, two to threes,
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.360]   whatever it's gonna be.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.400]   And then you measure and you come back like,
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.880]   oh, like we're kind of way off of that.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.240]   It's like, what can we do to get the ratio
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.480]   where we agreed was gonna produce more value?
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.040]   This turned out to be like a wonder drug
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.360]   for a lot of people where they were,
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.000]   person after person would tell me
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.040]   that they were convinced that the way they worked,
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.520]   like we're always on Slack,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.120]   you have to answer everything right away.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.760]   This was entrenched, this could never change.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.160]   And they did this exercise and the boss,
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.520]   the team lead was like, oh yeah,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.400]   so why don't we just no meetings or emails in the morning?
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.640]   No, like just drastic changes, seemingly out of nowhere,
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.200]   because there's like a number they're working at
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.040]   and it's positive.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.240]   It's framing it like, how do I produce more value
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.040]   and not like, will you stop bothering me or whatever?
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.640]   So those two are, I think, good first steps.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.400]   Centralizing teamwork and measurement.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.080]   Like, okay, what shouldn't we be trying to do?
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.840]   Oh, we're not there.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.960]   Like what ideas do we have to actually change this number?
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.640]   And that actually can spur a lot more flexibility
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.280]   and innovation than people often expect.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.880]   Yeah, it's a very good question.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.320]   - Thank you.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.160]   Hi Cal, I'm also a big fan.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.640]   So the Zoom apocalypse has been my life,
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.760]   working remotely for tech startups since the pandemic.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.800]   And so my question is,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.440]   given that humans are bad at estimating knowledge work
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.680]   or mental tasks,
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   and two, we can't apply assembly line metrics
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.520]   to knowledge work,
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.080]   and three, executives and managers won't like hearing,
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.560]   oh, I put three hours of deep work into it
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.320]   as a metric, a success metric.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:08.680]   How can we measure progress when using slow productivity?
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.000]   - Yeah, all right, good question.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.680]   So Zoom apocalypse, for those who don't know,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.480]   it talked about in the book
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.400]   where when all knowledge workers went remote
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.960]   during the pandemic,
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   we had this problem where the efficiency of collaboration
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.920]   got suddenly much worse because we lost all of the,
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.040]   let me grab you for five minutes and we'll figure this out.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.880]   And everything got turned to the Zoom meetings
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.080]   or Teams meetings.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.520]   But the smallest granularity
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.080]   that people could easily stretch a meeting
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.520]   on their calendar was 30 minutes.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.600]   So everything needed a 30 minute meeting.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.480]   And I began to hear from people that were saying,
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.320]   you know, I have eight hours back to back.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.160]   Like we had this question on the show, I think, Jesse,
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.320]   where like the question was literally,
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.920]   when do I go to the bathroom, Cal?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.200]   Because like I have these eight hours of meetings
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.280]   with no, there's no like 20 minute breaks in there
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.120]   or anything like that.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.240]   So like that was the Zoom apocalypse.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.680]   I mean, a couple of things.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.760]   One, you'd be surprised about, especially in the tech sector,
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.320]   if you say I got three hours of deep work done,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.600]   that they might be happier about that than you think.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   You know, that term is in Microsoft Outlook somewhere.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.880]   There's some mode where they say this is for deep work.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.160]   Yeah, so you're basically being over-meated.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.840]   So there's a couple of things to do
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.260]   I talk about in the book, right?
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.800]   So like these are a little, they're not sneaky,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.240]   but I think they're kind of clever heuristics.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.600]   A good one is the one for you, one for me heuristic, right?
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.000]   So like if you're in a business
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.160]   that lives and dies by the calendar,
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.080]   you have to have a meeting, your calendar is shared,
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.200]   like let's find a time or like whatever.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.280]   You can have a metric of every time I schedule a meeting,
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.160]   I find an equivalent amount of time that week
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.800]   and I block it off for a meeting with myself.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.240]   And then another person schedules a meeting,
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.160]   I find an equivalent amount of time somewhere else
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.040]   and I block that off, right?
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.640]   It preserves flexibility in meeting scheduling.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.200]   So like in a heavy meeting culture,
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.800]   it's hard to have rigid rules
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.440]   like I don't meet in the morning
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.880]   or I don't meet on Monday and Fridays
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.840]   because it's, you know, you keep getting these situations
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.400]   where like, no, that's the only time that works.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.560]   So you're not taking anything off the table,
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.580]   but you're just artificially filling your calendar
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.400]   faster than it was otherwise filling.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.040]   And so if you do a one for you, one for me,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.600]   you're going to end up with like a 50/50 ratio of meetings,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.280]   but you can tune that, right?
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.480]   If it's a heavy meeting role, it could be,
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.800]   if I put two hours in meetings,
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.280]   I put one hour of time for me,
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   or you could go the other way
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.960]   if you're like in a heavy development role or something,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.440]   you know, every hour of meeting, I find two hours.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.000]   And so you just use the calendar that's your enemy,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   it can become in that scenario in some sense,
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.820]   your savior as well.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.720]   Or you can do the deep to shallow work ratio method.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.460]   I mean, a lot of the examples I heard
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.640]   were from tech companies where the people said,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.720]   this is just a culture, like you gotta just be responsive,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.400]   you gotta just jump on calls or whatever.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   And they were surprised,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.720]   like when they had this conversation,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.520]   so what is the right ratio of a contract work
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.560]   and collaboration, like talking about work,
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.480]   like what's the right ratio for my job?
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.200]   Time and again, people will report,
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.840]   they're talking to their leader, their CEO or what have you.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.800]   And they immediately see in the room
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.000]   would be ridiculous to say,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.700]   no, I want you like 100% doing,
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:05.160]   talking and clap meetings and emails or whatever, right?
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.040]   In the room, it seems like it doesn't make sense.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.880]   So they sort of like, okay,
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.600]   we have to figure out some ratio that makes sense.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.720]   Like maybe half and half,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.480]   that's like typically what they say.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.680]   And then you have this number to measure.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.880]   And like, again and again, people would come back
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.960]   and the tech leader, the CEO is like, all right,
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.520]   well, I mean, I guess we're not hitting this 50/50.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.640]   I guess it does make sense.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.540]   Like, you shouldn't be spending all your time in meetings.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.380]   Okay, great.
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.680]   These two hours and these two hours,
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.120]   I'll just tell your team you're unavailable or whatever.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.920]   So don't be too pessimistic
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.960]   about that ratio technique working
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.280]   because I keep getting notes from people who are surprised
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.120]   when they're convinced it wasn't gonna work.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.040]   But mainly I just feel your pain
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.600]   because like a lot of people got out of the Zoom apocalypse
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.680]   because they were like uncle and people got tired of it.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.200]   But there are people still stuck in like,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.260]   well, everything has to be a meeting.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.600]   And it's my whole calendar's available till it's full.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.200]   It really is a kind of deranging state
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.920]   because it's like, I'm not working.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.240]   All I can do is talk about the work,
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.200]   but when do we do the work?
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.640]   I mean, it's part of what made what's going on
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   so frustrating for people.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.960]   So there's a lot of empathy coming from over here.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.800]   All right, let's take another quick break
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.960]   to talk about another sponsor
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.460]   that makes this show possible.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:15.760]   That's our friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.100]   I actually just had some Element this morning.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:18.940]   What is it?
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.760]   It's a mix, a drink mix.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.480]   It's a powder that you mix into water
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   and it puts into your water the electrolytes that you need,
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.960]   the sodium, the potassium, the magnesium
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.540]   at the right levels you really need
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.760]   if you have dehydrated yourself,
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.400]   you've been exercising or like me,
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.000]   I was at the live event you're hearing now.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.720]   I recorded that the night before.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.600]   So I was talking for like two and a half hours,
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.480]   came back with a big headache, dehydrated.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.040]   The first thing I did was mix some Element
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   into a big Nalgene water bottle.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   Had some more this morning
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.740]   because I have to get back everything I sweated out.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.400]   It's not just the liquid.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.200]   The reason why I like Element is that A,
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.600]   they get the ratios right.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.240]   They know how much of these electrolytes you actually need
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.100]   and make sure you're getting enough, right?
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.840]   It's designed by the former research biochemist, Rob Wolf
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.320]   and the Keto Gains founder, Luis Vilsenor.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   The other thing I like about it,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.180]   zero sugar, zero artificial colors,
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.620]   no other dodgy ingredients.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.880]   So I don't feel like I'm drinking a soda
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.240]   when I'm trying to rehydrate after a big event
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.180]   or after a long workout or after a day's full of lecturing.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.720]   I know there's no sugar in here.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.700]   There's no junk in here.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.160]   It's just the stuff I need to add to the water
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.360]   to make sure that I get hydrated.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.360]   They've got a lot of cool flavors, fan favorites,
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.680]   like citrus salt or raspberry salt,
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.200]   but they also have spicy flavors like mango chili.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.480]   You can actually mix, I've heard about this,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.320]   their flavor chocolate salt tastes good
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.480]   if you mix it into a morning coffee.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.120]   I'll tell you this, I won't name names,
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.520]   but I've been on a podcast tour.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.480]   I was recently to promote my new book
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.680]   and I can tell you multiple podcasters
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.460]   who promote this Element on their podcast
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.820]   are drinking it right there when I'm there.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.320]   This is like one of these products that we all use.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.680]   So I love Element, no sugar, no nodginess.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.040]   We've got an offer for you.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.520]   If you go to drinkelement.com/deep,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.720]   drinkelement.com/deep, if you do that slash deep,
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.080]   you will get a free sample pack
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.800]   with any drink mix purchase.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.080]   So you buy a drink mix purchase,
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.480]   they'll send you a free sample pack
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.060]   so you can try out the other flavors as well.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:28.840]   That's drinkelement.com/deep.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.620]   I also wanna talk about our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.740]   Oh, Blinkist.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.620]   They just added actually the slow productivity blink
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.540]   to the Blinkist app.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.500]   So I'm excited about that.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.620]   So what is Blinkist?
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.920]   It's an app that gives you over 6,500 book summaries
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.220]   and expert led audio guides to read and listen to
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.460]   in just 15 minutes per title.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.700]   You can access best in class actionable knowledge
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.300]   from 27 categories, such as productivity, psychology,
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.100]   and more on the go and get entertained at the same time.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.260]   The way I use Blinkist is to triage potential book purchases
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.540]   like, oh, I'm interested in this topic.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.760]   Okay, here's a couple of books on this topic.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.060]   Let me listen to the blinks.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:08.980]   I like to listen to them.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.300]   Jesse likes to read them, whatever.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.560]   It's a short summer.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.340]   Let me listen to the blinks
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.900]   and get a sense of the main ideas from the book.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.340]   This really gives me the information I need to say,
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.260]   ah, I get what this book's about.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.160]   I don't need to read 250 pages.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.900]   Oh, this book is going somewhere interesting.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.200]   Let me buy that one.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.460]   So I use Blinkist as a triage mechanism.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.580]   Other people use it other ways.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.220]   I know some people who just use it like a pod.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.140]   It's just entertaining.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.700]   It's like a really awesome podcast, right?
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.820]   Any author you want to be a guest on a podcast,
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.760]   you can just listen to the blink summary of their book
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.480]   and sort of get the main ideas of the book.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.540]   And so some people just use it
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.440]   for straight up entertainment.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.280]   You know, I love it.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.740]   Some people use it to actually learn things.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.360]   I kind of want to know about crypto,
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.640]   but I don't want to read a lot of books.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.680]   I'll listen to five blinks
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.380]   and I'll know enough to be conversational.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.220]   It's a great tool,
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.860]   a great accompaniment to those who are interested
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.500]   in the reading life.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.180]   Here's another cool thing to have going on right now
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.020]   called Blinkist Connect.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.700]   This allows you to, how's this work?
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.380]   Okay, you can give another person unlimited access
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.060]   to your account for free.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.900]   So it's basically a two for one deal.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:18.740]   So if you like Blinkist,
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.260]   you can bring someone else into the Blinkist fold.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.840]   So I mentioned they just released the Blink
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.700]   on my new book, "Slow Productivity" and it's great.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.300]   So I'll say that's my favorite blink
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.820]   on the platform right now.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.520]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.500]   just for our audience.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:35.300]   Go to blinkist.com/deep to start your seven day free trial
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:39.860]   and get 40% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.060]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.540]   blinkist.com/deep to get 40% off
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.140]   and a seven day free trial.

[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.620]   And remember now for a limited time,
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.000]   you can even use Blinkist Connect
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.520]   to share your premium account.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.040]   You'll get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.120]   All right, let's get back to the live show
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.060]   at People's Books.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.600]   - Hi Cal, Roy from Berkeley, California,
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.100]   a long time fan of your stuff.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.760]   I understand the first principle about we're doing less.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.300]   It's not easy to do, but I get that.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.760]   I should also add I'm a recovering perfectionist.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.100]   Where I struggle sometimes is I see a conflict
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.860]   between working at a natural pace
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.620]   and obsessing over quality.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.520]   Especially because I've seen some of the techniques
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.060]   you recommended for obsessing over quality,
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.680]   you know, like get an investor, work less, you know.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.140]   But these sort of strike me as an external forcing function
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.700]   that might conflict with me working at my own pace.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.980]   Also like, you know, when you were doing tenure,
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.700]   you have an external deadline, right?
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.460]   So you may want to do insights that take you 10 years,
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.020]   but tenure is gonna say, oh, you got five, right?
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.740]   So how do you address that sort of conflict
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.180]   between those two principles?
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.620]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.740]   So these stakes in the ground,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.780]   like, okay, someone is, I told someone this is coming.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.980]   Or like the example in the book
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.420]   was talking about the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.460]   where they released a single.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.500]   So like, okay, we kind of have to,
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.520]   we have time, we're taking a lot more time than before,
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.740]   but we kind of have to finish this
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.100]   because otherwise the single's gonna go stale.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.260]   That's all about walking that tightrope
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:24.740]   between perfectionism and like really caring about craft
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.500]   because perfectionism is a real issue
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.780]   and that's one of the ways you can sort of get around it.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.580]   So working at a natural pace has a couple of components.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.620]   One is variation in intensity.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.120]   So don't try to be all on all intensity every day
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.340]   all year round, right?
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.500]   So that's fine, that's compatible
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.940]   with, you know, stakes in the ground.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.940]   And then the second piece is taking longer, right?
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.340]   Don't try to rush work.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.300]   We see this time and again when we look at people
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.180]   who really care about craft, that they spend,
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.260]   they take their time on things, right?
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.620]   They sort of, they don't try to do it
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.240]   the fastest possible way.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.660]   The stakes in the ground is making sure
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.320]   that time doesn't become forever time, right?
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.820]   So it's like, that's the protection against the like,
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.580]   look, slow down, don't try to rush everything,
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.220]   be okay to have some quieter periods
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.820]   and some harder work periods.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.980]   You know, how do you have that plus a commitment to craft
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.460]   and not just say, look, my novel will be done next year
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.300]   and you say that for the next 50 years.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.420]   And so that seems to be these type of stakes in the ground,
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.020]   committing the people, I'm going to do this,
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.920]   I took on money, whatever it is.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.940]   Those stakes in the ground seem to be the best way we have
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.220]   of like walking that tightrope between them.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.360]   Yeah, it's a very good question.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.420]   Also as an excuse, I really went deep on the Beatles.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.500]   That was like a fun part of the book as well.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.620]   - So Nick Becks, I've been a personal trainer
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.060]   for about seven years.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.360]   Actually recent listener to the podcast as well.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.200]   So not too much involved,
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.560]   but I'm loving everything that I'm hearing.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.520]   But seven years in personal training,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.200]   I basically been on the ground,
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   listening to everybody in the corporate life struggling,
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   and I'm pretty much committed to kind of providing
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.480]   some solutions towards that.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.640]   So me and a lot of partners have been working towards
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.360]   building a corporate wellness solutions company.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.280]   And we're struggling to try and vocalize
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.840]   basically all of these principles to higher up the chain,
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.300]   because a lot of individuals that are working
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.560]   lower down the chain, they want this,
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.640]   they're desperate for it.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   But the people higher up the chain
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.940]   are all about just trying to get the outcome.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.720]   So how do we do that?
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.040]   - It's a really hard challenge.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.840]   And it's one that I'm relatively nihilistic about, right?
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.080]   Like a big decision I made in this book
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.200]   was to focus mainly on the individual.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.160]   'Cause I've tried to focus higher up before,
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.440]   it's very difficult,
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.980]   especially like mid to large size organizations.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.000]   It's very difficult to get drastic changes
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.960]   in the way work unfolds coming from the top down.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   And there's whole theories about why this is.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.720]   There's this book I keep talking about,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.560]   Alfred Chandler's book, "The Visible Hand."
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.200]   It's from the 1970s as an economic historian,
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.900]   won a bunch of prizes, Pulitzer, National Book Award.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.600]   But he talks about the rise of the big organization.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.600]   And one of his ideas in this book
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.320]   is as we switched over to big organizations,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.360]   which really didn't exist pre-railroads for the most part.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.040]   As we switched over to big organizations
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.740]   with many layers of management,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.360]   it's really a new type of capitalism
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.520]   that he calls managerial capitalism.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.800]   And one of the things that characterizes
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.040]   managerial capitalism is the way
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.800]   that the organizations internally operate.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.280]   Like the way like the managers operate internally
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.300]   are relatively buffeted from market signals.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.520]   So like it's fine for them to stay ossified
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.760]   in a way of organizing work.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.000]   It's like not a really good way of working.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.880]   When they're big enough,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.400]   the signals that they begin optimizing for
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.520]   are more like things like stability, like risk reduction.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.000]   I don't want to lose my position in the C-suite
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.560]   or as a high-level manager, et cetera.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.640]   And I really think that's a strong force
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.540]   that's preserving a lot of these ways we work
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.120]   that's just objectively like a terrible way
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.200]   to take human brains and produce value, right?
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.120]   It's like running a car factory,
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.620]   but you have all like the lights off to save money
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.000]   and people are putting steering wheels
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.640]   where the wheels are supposed to go.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.620]   It doesn't really make sense.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.260]   But in these like large organizations
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.840]   where things are more ambiguous,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.680]   I've talked to a lot of C-suite people.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.940]   I've talked to a lot of well-known CEOs.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.960]   It's really difficult to try to affect that change.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.680]   So with this, I went back to
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.920]   what can you do as the individual
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.320]   to begin to integrate some of these principles
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.280]   into your life or your team's life
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.400]   in a way that you can make things much better,
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.060]   knowing that that's much easier
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.260]   than getting the person 10 levels up
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.200]   to say we're going to get rid of email.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.360]   Yes, it could be frustrating.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.160]   The knowledge work is a weird space.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.900]   - Hi, my name's Josh.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.740]   I'm Perry.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.640]   I'm a local to this area.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.960]   I followed you through all your podcasting friends,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.400]   Ryan Holiday, Scott Young, all those people.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.040]   But my question is, so your Kanban system,
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.920]   I implemented it like in my work
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.320]   'cause I work in cybersecurity
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.660]   and we have a research project.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.680]   So like we have the needs doing column,
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.900]   the in progress and the finished, right?
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.940]   I think the issue that we're running into is like,
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.840]   if we get stuck on any technical problem,
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.120]   like it throws you down a rabbit hole
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.520]   and you end up spending like too much time
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.640]   on that like one issue.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.280]   And like, we have to be really efficient with our hours
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.320]   'cause we have like a limited number of hours
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.200]   because of budget constraints, right?
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.760]   Like we can only spend like 400 hours on the project
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.940]   and we've already spent like 150 hours on the project.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.940]   So each hour is like extremely important to how,
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.040]   so like, I guess like how do you make the,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.200]   those three columns work in a team setting
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.160]   if some problems like you get stuck
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.440]   because of like technical constraints?
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.840]   So when you're getting stuck is,
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.960]   so what's happening is then it takes a long time
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.440]   to try to figure out what's going on.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.080]   Well, first of all, I think that term,
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.320]   I guess I should define for other people.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.080]   So Kanban, a lot of what I'm talking about
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.960]   with like centralized workloads
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.000]   and keeping track of like who's working on what
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.280]   and you work on a smaller number of things.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.920]   This is a well-known methodology.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.220]   So people in cybersecurity,
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.960]   people in computer programming, development shops,
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.720]   know these methodologies very well.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.320]   And so Kanban's like one of the names
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.280]   that comes out of industrial manufacturing.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.000]   You may have heard of agile methodologies.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.580]   Most of those borrow these metaphors
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.720]   of different work and different statuses.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.320]   So I have one suggestion.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.560]   This is probably not gonna be maybe like
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.600]   the killer suggestion,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.160]   but one thing I've seen work well in these type of firms
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.600]   is having sort of more of these pre-scheduled,
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.560]   they're short, but sort of all hands on deck
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.720]   kind of check-ins, like even throughout the day, right?
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.880]   So it's like at noon, all right, everyone,
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.920]   let's all stop what we're doing.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.840]   Okay, who's stuck, who needs what?
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.760]   And it's like you have, everyone's there.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.800]   Okay, I don't know what to do here.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.680]   Oh, I know about this.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.520]   I read about this.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.840]   You get all the brains together
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.600]   and you swat all the problems you can right away.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.340]   And if you can't swat them right away,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.280]   you're able to figure out a plan right there.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.160]   Well, who's well suited to figure this out?
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.760]   Go do that, do that now.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.840]   And we can check back in again
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.200]   when we have this meeting again.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.280]   It's like trying to prevent there being
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.720]   really like long or ambiguous amounts of time
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.240]   where like someone is just starting to work
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.320]   on trying to figure this out
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.960]   and a couple of days go by
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.440]   and then they email someone else like I'm stuck on it.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.460]   So that might help a little bit
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.720]   because I've seen that model
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.040]   of not just like the morning meeting,
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.960]   like morning, midday, late afternoon,
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.520]   especially when like a lot of collaboration
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.960]   like has to happen for solving problems.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.680]   Yeah, but cybersecurity, like computer programming shops,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.240]   they're so far ahead of everyone else.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   I feel like when it comes to workload management,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.760]   like they already know these ideas.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.440]   At least they think about these ideas
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.800]   of externalizing work and having a system.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.360]   I mean, even that question is a question
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.120]   that wouldn't be relevant to most knowledge workers
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.680]   because they don't have even a notion of like work
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.720]   and what status it is.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.320]   It's just email, like things are just flying back and forth.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.640]   And so I take a lot of inspiration
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   from those sectors, actually.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.840]   There's a lot of interesting stuff going on there.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.120]   - Hi, thank you for being here.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.440]   I'm curious about in the question
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.520]   that was just asked before me,
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.460]   you answered it a little bit,
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.600]   but I'm curious about being early career
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.400]   and on teams where,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.760]   I'm pretty much able to balance my workload.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.400]   I have, I work at a big law firm,
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.320]   so I have a number of any partners
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.800]   that could possibly be assigning me work at any time.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.600]   And I've gotten to a point where I'm comfortable in my work
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.120]   and comfortable to be able to say,
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.200]   you know, I have this assignment.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.680]   I'm happy to get to this next week and that's working well.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.000]   I'm curious if you have thoughts
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.980]   on managing peer relationships with folks that are on teams.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.720]   And if you don't respond on teams,
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.280]   send an email a couple of minutes later
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.040]   and sort of balancing that teamwork
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.520]   where the teams are more nebulous and super fluid.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.120]   - Yeah, yeah, it's a great question,
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.920]   especially early career.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.680]   One thing that definitely helps is to,
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.480]   as quickly as possible,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.120]   develop a reputation for being incredibly organized.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.680]   Like develop a reputation early on
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.120]   as a time management nerd, you know?
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.160]   Like a partner comes to you to ask you questions about,
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.040]   hey, are you using like a time blocker?
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.320]   Like, what do you know about this or whatever?
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.800]   They sort of know.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.560]   That reputation gains you,
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.800]   Adam Grant has a term for this.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.800]   He calls it idiosyncrasy credits.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.640]   It gains you flexibility
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.120]   because there's a trust there, right?
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.240]   So for example,
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.000]   if they don't know if you're organized or not,
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.880]   or if you have a reputation of being disorganized,
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.600]   there's going to be an expectation of like,
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.120]   I would rather you just do this right away
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.360]   and respond right away because I can't let this go.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.000]   I can't trust you to do it necessarily.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.480]   So now I have to keep it in my head until you're done.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.640]   So I would really just rather you do this right away.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.840]   But if on the other hand, it's like,
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.720]   I wish you would stop talking about Cal Newport
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.440]   and these time blocking and all this type of stuff,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.160]   you're still solving the problem of like,
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.960]   oh, she'll get it done, right?
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.000]   So I don't, it doesn't matter to me as much of, you know,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.880]   is she on teams right away responding
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.720]   if you have that reputation.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.400]   If they're like, did she really just send us
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.160]   like an IT ticket for like whatever?
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.120]   They're like, okay, she's got it handled.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.680]   So that it can earn you so much breathing room.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.320]   Like the more you develop that reputation,
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.680]   the more people trust you,
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.200]   the more like they know you have these idiosyncratic systems,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.120]   but they work well, it helps.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.240]   And then you begin to get some flexibility
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.920]   and like, yeah, I don't always like respond right away,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.800]   but also you always get a response within two hours.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.840]   I sent you these updates.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.560]   And there's a couple of examples in the book you'll like
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.120]   along those lines where it's like really almost over the top.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.360]   Like you're sending these like these update emails
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.680]   to the stakeholders of like the status of your task
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.400]   has just shifted to over here.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   It all seems crazy.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.240]   But what it does give you is like a lot of breathing room.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.080]   - You came back.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.440]   - I'm back, yeah.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.680]   - Are we tight on time?
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.520]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.960]   - Okay, all right, well, excellent.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.880]   Well, thank you everyone for coming out.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.640]   These questions, this deep dive,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.080]   we're gonna clean that up
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.760]   and we're gonna release it on the podcast feed.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.800]   So if you wanna hear yourself and your questions,
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.400]   the podcast is called Deep Questions.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.240]   I think we're gonna use AI to just alter all the questions
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.040]   to be just mainly very positive.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.520]   (audience laughing)
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.600]   I knew you were smart, Cal,
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.960]   but I didn't know you were in that good shape.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.360]   Oh, well, thank you, Congressman Raskin.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.280]   So we're just gonna really work with,
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   we're really gonna deep fake the heck out of this now.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.720]   I'm joking, we will.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.120]   But thank you very much for coming.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.200]   I love the questions
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.480]   and I love "Tacoma Park" in people's books.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.720]   So this was great.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.840]   Thank you.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.880]   (audience applauding)
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.520]   - All right, it's Cal here again, back in the Deep Work HQ.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.580]   I thought that was a lot of fun.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.840]   I really enjoyed the questions at that live show.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.560]   I was there for another hour.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.280]   So after what you heard ended,
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.640]   I was there for another hour just talking with people.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.200]   We were signing books and just talking with people.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.060]   People had come from all over.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.200]   I think one of the coolest things
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.040]   was there was multiple couples there
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.080]   from somewhere from Canada,
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.880]   somewhere from California, I believe,
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:31.160]   who just coincidentally were vacationing in Washington, DC
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.080]   and just saw me mention I was gonna do this show.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.440]   So they were able to bop over and be like,
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.280]   hey, what's going on?
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.100]   Let's see Cal.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:36.940]   So it was cool.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.320]   I got to see people from all over.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.660]   I got to see someone who I talked to years ago
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:44.940]   and had given him advice to go ahead with a book idea.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.920]   And he told me at the show afterwards,
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.860]   that book is now coming out.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.780]   It's now gonna be published.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.660]   That was really cool.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.740]   So anyways, that was a lot of fun.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.400]   It was great to see everyone.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.540]   I love those questions.
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.300]   Got a lot of good feedback, got a lot of good support.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.540]   So thank you, everyone who came.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.000]   Thank you, People's Book,
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.280]   favorite bookstore in Washington, DC.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.840]   Again, you can buy a signed copy of "Slow Productivity"
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.120]   straight from them.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.640]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.600]   Great way to support independent bookstores.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.480]   And that's it for today.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.720]   We'll be back next week with a standard NDHQ episode
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.660]   of the "Deep Questions" podcast.
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.600]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.880]   Okay, so if you enjoyed our discussion today,
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.600]   I think you might also like episode 275,
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600]   which gives a general system for achieving hard goals.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.720]   So check that out.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.140]   So the question I wanna dive into today
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:43.140]   is how do you follow through on transformative goals?
