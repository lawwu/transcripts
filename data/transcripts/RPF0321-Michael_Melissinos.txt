[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.100]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about what it's like to actually build from
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.040]   nothing. And I mean absolutely nothing. From nothing. What is it like to build an investment
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.680]   management firm? And here, I'm not talking about the type of financial advisor that I
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.520]   was, helping people with their financial planning. I'm talking about somebody who's managing
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.840]   an investment firm. My guest today is Michael Melissinos. He started from nothing, worked
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.120]   his way up, and has been systematically building a standalone investment advisory business.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.560]   And through the context of that business, we're going to talk about how to learn investing.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.520]   We're going to talk about an investment strategy known as trend following, which is where Michael
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.320]   is an expert. And we're also going to talk about building a life and how to decide between
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   taking a job and building a business.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.360]   Thank you for being with me. I'd like to talk about investing. And we're going to talk on
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.280]   this show in the future with seasoned portfolio managers. My guest today, he's not unseasoned,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   but he's also not a 30-year veteran. And so some of the emotion and the challenge and
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.480]   the learning process is still fresh and raw. And I think that's going to benefit you. Michael
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.160]   Melissinos is a listener of the show sometimes and he reached out to me and said, "Hey, would
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.200]   you like to interview me? I got an interesting story." And I said, "Absolutely." And I think
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.400]   he's got something very valuable to talk about.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.320]   We talk about the specifics of trading strategies. So those of you who are interested in trading
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.360]   and in different trends – well, specifically in trend following but in different types
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.200]   of investment strategies, you will enjoy this interview today. It's a fairly lengthy one
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.240]   so I'm going to get right to it. One sponsor for today's show is Trade King. Trade King

[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.400]   Michael welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   Michael Radkin, Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.480]   Hey. Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.440]   This interview today will be interesting because I want to use your story to provide some insight
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.040]   for my audience into what it's like to actually build an investment business. So to begin
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.240]   with, I'd like you simply to share your story. How did you wind up in a position of
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.480]   running an investment management firm?
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:19.160]   Oh boy. All right. Well, the drive to start one has always been there. I was a sports
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.880]   kid growing up. That's all I did with my time. So I always had the drive to compete,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:36.880]   always had the drive to be the best or just challenge myself and stuff like that. I was
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.080]   born in 1984, so I watched a lot of old football, Super Bowl type stuff. So I got really into
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.280]   Joe Montana, really into Jerry Rice and got really into when the Yankees got good because
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.800]   I grew up in New Jersey, so I was a born Yankee fan. When the Yankees got good in '96,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:09.240]   mid '90s and just started dominating, that's when my, I think, drive to separate myself
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.200]   and not fit in and not just get a job and not be like everyone else. I needed to be
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   one of these guys that I used to watch, Derek Jeter, like I said, Montana and those guys.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.040]   And I just fell in love with absolutely crushing everybody at everything, in my case, sports.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   So when, obviously I go through school, play sports, I played baseball in college, but
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   then I broke my leg in a really bad car accident going to actually a pro tryout. And that was
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.520]   pretty much it for my career because I had a bad break. It was rod and screws inserted
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.720]   into my shin. It was disgusting. So fast forward, I get out of college, no longer playing. And
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:08.360]   then what do I do? I do the classic human thing and wimp out. I go and take a job. I
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.200]   take a job in public accounting, if you will. And nothing wrong with accounting, nothing
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   wrong with accountants.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Wasn't you.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.360]   But come on, you know, Joe Montan is not being an accountant after he's done playing football,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   you know. Come on. So this, it didn't really sync up and I always had like, God damn, I'm
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.120]   giving in, I'm listening to my dad, my uncle, my mom, because my uncle is a big accountant
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.960]   guy and he's like, you know, it gives you the best career path, yada, yada, yada. So
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:47.520]   okay, I don't know anything, fine. So I did that and almost immediately, probably within
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:58.000]   like a few days, I was like, no, nope, this is not it. Nope. But still did the human thing,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.400]   right? And, you know, began talking to myself, talk myself out of moving, moving fast. And
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.360]   I sat there for 10 months, you know, went through the busy season type of thing and,
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.240]   you know, just went through that. So there goes 10 months doing something I didn't want
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.640]   to do. It didn't like that. Then I called my friend at Bear Stearns and is my friend
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.720]   since T-ball. I went to high school with him. We were neighbors growing up. And I said,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.160]   John, dude, I need, I need to get out of here. I got to get on the front line somehow. And
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.200]   Bear Stearns, people who don't know is, was a, at the time, one of the older investment
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.400]   banks in the world. And it is now since gone. And that's where the story really gets good.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.120]   So I ultimately get the job at Bear. And what was the job that you got there? Yeah, it was
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.200]   on a, what's called a market intelligence team. It's basically a made up team for when
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.760]   you're in a really good part of the business cycle and you start making shit up, start
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:10.120]   making jobs up that don't really do anything. But, you know, so what I did was I, I covered
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:20.640]   the healthcare and biotech sector. So I worked with the, the healthcare traders, interpret
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:27.720]   news, prepare for events. And in healthcare, you have a lot of events like drug, drug approval
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:34.200]   dates and conferences, stuff like this. So I basically had to know everything about every
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   stock that we covered and knew what was important coming up. And if anything new, if any news
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.120]   hit the tape that that was important, uh, I had to know what it meant for what stocks
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.040]   and what had that affected earnings and yada yada, like pretty much know everything about
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.240]   everything. So it took up a lot of time. He was like, get up at four o'clock in the morning
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.920]   every day in the office at five and then be home at nine or something every day. And,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:08.520]   um, you know, quickly, you know, I started in October. So then in March, obviously is
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.880]   when things got a little wild. So March bear goes down and then I'm sitting there with
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:23.400]   the aha of, okay, maybe this isn't it either. Because during this time, you know, starting
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:30.760]   from, from that summer when I worked in accounting, which was summer 2007 through, through when
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.680]   bear went down, which is March Oh eight, I was researching and reading, um, reading into
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.720]   what I do now, which is, which is the kind of, which is the kind of trading that I do
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.560]   now, which is called trend following trading. Um, and you know, just lightly learning about
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.520]   it. And then I, and then I started to get to the point where I started following the
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.120]   firms that were already, that were trading this way, these trend following firms. And,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.640]   uh, uh, weirdly enough, they're not, they're not your brand name, wall street type of guys.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:10.200]   They're not on CNBC. They don't, they don't, uh, basically don't come into the public at
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.720]   all. Um, but probably the most famous one is, is John Henry, the owner of the red socks.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.880]   He was a major trend following trader before he basically gave all that up just to become
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:30.440]   a sports owner. So, um, uh, so we started, you know, learning and seeing how these guys,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.480]   these traders would do really well when it seemed like everyone else wasn't doing well
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.600]   and seemed like when everyone else didn't know what the hell was going on and everyone's
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.520]   run around with their hair caught on fire. So that was a big aha. When I started seeing
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.880]   these guys make a lot of money, when everyone around me was losing their job and losing
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   their bonus or losing their, you know, their stock money, especially at bear, like a lot
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.760]   of guys lost everything. So that was my first big, huh? I could do this. All right. But
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.400]   still I'm going to wimp out and just stick with my job for a bit cause I don't really
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.600]   know what I'm doing yet. So got into the more, more of the reading, more of the research.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.400]   And at that point, you know, I was still working at a JP Morgan's JP Morgan bought bear. And
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.920]   then I started, uh, I started working, uh, working on creating some trading strategies
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   and I, you know, I use a lot of numbers and it's easy to, uh, you know, uh, you know,
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.760]   with trend following, it's usually systematic. So usually creating like a set of rules that
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   are quantified, you know, use numbers for, to make decisions. And, um, you know, so that
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.800]   was my, um, that was where a lot of us, I spent a lot of my time doing that over the
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.840]   coming months. And then October Oh eight happens. And that's another major aha. And that was
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:55.040]   a major, major point for, uh, these trend following guys to really do well. And they
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.760]   had been doing well for many, many years before this, but I was new to this. So I was the
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.040]   first to, you know, I was starting to experience it in real time. You know, you can look at
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   back track records all you want, but you don't really know where the numbers come from, how
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.840]   they happen because you didn't really live through the events and stuff. So I started
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.000]   to see the real time proof and I could, I could couple it with the feeling of being
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.640]   on the front line. Like, Oh, this is how it's done. Ah, all right. I could do this. And
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.000]   then I, then I started getting more confident with that. I can, I can actually do the thing
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.520]   and start something on my own. And, um, so we all got laid off in January Oh nine. Um,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:46.720]   that whole team I was on and, and then I started to, uh, say, all right, this is it. This is,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   they cut the cord for me. I can, I can get out now. And this was, yeah, this is January
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   or not. So I, uh, you know, I took a job as, as a trader and then I, you know, wanted to
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.460]   learn, learn the stuff. So I did that. And basically on the side, I just kept creating
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.040]   my model, kept creating my strategy for when I was going to launch. So ultimately it went
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:16.720]   down for another two years. Just a big, big, big, awful. So for you entrepreneurs out there
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.520]   listening, uh, thinking about, you know, how all the, all the guys doing it now, it's so
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.680]   easy. They're just like bread. It's, it's in their blood and they just do it. Yeah.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.800]   Right. You know, sometimes it takes, um, it takes some, I don't know what it takes, but
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:41.200]   here I, here I had the proof that it worked. I understood why it was working, you know,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.040]   for what I ultimately was going to do. And I had the inner drive to do it, but something
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.440]   was keeping me back. You know, it was just, you know, fear of the unknown, lack of confidence
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.760]   or something. I don't know. Um, so somewhere in me that was stopping me. So, so I sat through
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.660]   another couple of good market, uh, cycles for, for this trend following strategy and
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.580]   trend following does really well when there's persistent trends, when there's not the choppiness
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.560]   up and down, up and down. Um, when there's big dislocations like, like what we've recently
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.400]   seen in oil, that's a real good period for, for trend following. Cause it's a big, easy
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:31.560]   trend to follow. Right. So, so ultimately sat through, you know, all the QE quantitative
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.600]   easing one, two, and then, you know, in QE two and the back half of 2010 was when there
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.880]   was another really good period, a lot of commodities, a lot of good trends. And these guys did really
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:51.600]   well again. And I'm like, God damn it. Like I missed another great period to do well,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.560]   you know, because it's not, you know, for, for, you know, it's, this is not like, uh,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.960]   maybe other, other sectors of, um, uh, of startup culture where, you know, you can kind
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.240]   of get, if you get onto a good, uh, business model, you can kind of get persistent growth
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:16.640]   and persistent, um, steady, you know, profits and stuff like that, you know, with markets,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.480]   this is, this is something different because there's good periods and there's bad periods.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:28.320]   There's no persistent good period ever. Um, it only comes in waves. So of course, what
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.520]   do I do? I sit through the next good period. I get so frustrated to say, that's it. January
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:42.080]   11, that that's what we're starting. I started and I started right after a good period. Now,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.360]   what happened? I got the tail end of the good period and walked straight into the whole
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:55.800]   flush full cycle, bad period, which there was no trends to follow. Right. So I got a
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.400]   little taste of it. My first six months I was, I believe I was up, you know, six, uh,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.680]   I'm sorry, like 25% or something. And my first initial investors were like, God, this is
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.280]   great. Okay. This is a good continue. I said, this is not going to continue. This is the
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.520]   kiss of death. Um, that was back when like gold topped and everything. And there were
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.280]   really good trends at that, at that time. But then everything slowed down because then
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.840]   I believe the fed and other central banks, they started, you know, changing their policies.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.960]   And when, and when, when we live in the, um, the, you know, the economic model that we
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.640]   live in, where we have central bank intervention and intervention, um, we get a lot of this
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:44.680]   back and forth sometimes, you know, where they, they see things, they see trends, uh,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.640]   develop that they don't like and they say, Oh, we've got to pull back. So what do they
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.800]   do? They knock the trends down and everything, you know, everything kind of stays in its
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.360]   tight window and you know, it builds pressure in those windows until at some point things
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.800]   break out and then they run. And that's when I do well. But, uh, but yeah, I wore, I walked
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   right into that tightening window where, where markets weren't doing much. And, uh, I was
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:17.280]   like, God damn, you know, and it, it was annoying, but it was a really good lesson, um, to want
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.760]   to not rush into anything, uh, to, you know, to when you have the feeling, when you have
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.640]   the drive, you know, sometimes it's just best just to go, don't think and just go. If you're
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.160]   ready, you kind of know you're ready. Let's go. Don't try to be perfect. I tried to be
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:40.920]   perfect and, uh, it got me into the, into the slop. Um, so yeah, I mean, you know, I
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.600]   don't think the details of like how I started the fun, I mean, is that, you think that's
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.520]   important? We'll get into that in a moment, but first I want to ask this question. So
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.440]   you say that during that time you were at Bear Stearns and, and, uh, later JP Morgan,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:00.920]   um, during that time you were watching many traders and portfolio managers get creamed,
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   but you said that the, the trend, the trend followers didn't get creamed. First, what
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.760]   would be your evidence or proof that they didn't? And number two, why not? What was
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.000]   different about trend following as a strategy, um, that made that succeed in that, in that
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:25.240]   market? Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was watching the, the, the firms themselves and you know,
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.400]   watching their monthly performance, uh, their, their performance numbers. Um, and you know,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   uh, do you want me to give you a couple of names of like the firms? Sure. That'd be great.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.720]   Yeah. Um, so the biggest and baddest one, uh, not necessarily the best, but, uh, the
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:49.520]   biggest and best one is called Witten Capital, W I N T O N. They're a big, big firm in London.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.280]   Uh, then we have a Chesapeake Capital. We have Tactical Investment Management. It's
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:05.440]   another one. EMC, uh, Capital, um, a couple other ones, Dunn, Dunn Capital, D U N N he's
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.560]   in a Stewart, Florida. Um, so I don't know if that's close to you. Um, and, uh, John
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.080]   Henry was still around. He's no longer a firm though. Um, there's a couple other from Abraham.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.280]   There's like, you know, there's, there's dozens of them, but I'm naming, I'm naming like the
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.240]   longest, uh, the guys with the longest track records, the guys who I looked up. So why
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.880]   did they, why did they not get creamed? Because they're trend followers. They're no, they
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   don't stick with positions that go against the trend. So naturally when, to, when, um,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.120]   let's say 2008 hits, right. What, what were the trends, right? Stocks were going down,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:55.240]   funds were going up, dollar was going up, uh, commodities going down. Right. So, and
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:02.280]   they did so for an extended period of time, these weren't day or week long trends that,
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.540]   you know, stocks went down for a week and then they came back up. No, they persisted
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.160]   down for months, you know, down, down, down, you know, sure they had their bounces, but
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.360]   they went down, down, down, same, same thing for the other trends. So what the trend followers
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.960]   do is that they position themselves with that longterm momentum, right? So they're not,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.480]   they're not buying stocks like, Oh, these are going down at some point later, they're
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.160]   going to come back up. So let's get, let's buy in now and, and, and improve our dollar
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.680]   cost average, you know, and keep betting that, uh, that it's going to go up later, even though
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:44.480]   it's going down now. So they would inherently put themselves, you know, if you, if you invested
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.200]   like that, which a lot of people do, a lot of fundamental strategies are like that. They,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.920]   they bet, you know, they buy low and sell high, right? Trend followers do the opposite.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:04.000]   They buy high, sell low and betting that that momentum is going to continue. So in 2008,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.880]   um, October, they just had short positions that they probably were getting short stocks
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:18.800]   in this case, uh, probably in late 2007 and, and they just held through the whole decline.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.840]   You got to look at a chart. I can't, we go, can't pop up a chart right now, but the, but
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:31.320]   the rollover downtrend started in late 2007. So, or early 2009 or early 2008. So it wasn't
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:37.480]   like, Oh, these guys got a huge short position put on and in October and they made a ton.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.360]   No, they were just, no, we've been short for many months, dude. Like, I don't know what
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.400]   you guys are doing, uh, type of a thing. And, and, um, you know, same thing with the bonds,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.800]   you know, like usually when, when stocks get hit pretty good and people run to safety,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.880]   they run to bonds, you know, and run to the dollar. So they were positioned with those
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:06.080]   trends. Um, and when those trends persisted, they do really well. So right now, like 2014,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.640]   uh, was a good one because the dollar went, dollar went up, currencies went down and same
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.120]   thing, bonds, bonds went up. So another, that was another really good year for all of us.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.240]   Um, we were just positioned with those trends. We were not, we were staying in the now of,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.520]   of the trend. You know, we were respecting the trend. We're not, we don't look at what
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:37.200]   a lot of guys do is say, look, the longterm of value of stocks is X right now. It's the
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.080]   price is X minus 10. So that means there's good value. So that means it's a good buy.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.120]   Well, they don't understand that, that, that value could keep decreasing for a long time
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.840]   or in a, in a significant way before it ever comes back to where they think the value really
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.240]   is. You know, that's, that's the problem with fundamental, um, fundamental strategies that
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.440]   they're inherently putting themselves on the wrong side of the trend. Uh, most of the time,
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.960]   you know, to get that good value, you know, I mean, that's, that's where that buy low,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.200]   sell high comes from, you know,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.880]   What are the mistakes? Um, what is, is the mistake or what are the mistakes that you
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:26.440]   would make, uh, or could make as a trend portfolio of trend following portfolio manager that
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   would lead to your getting creamed?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:36.480]   Oh, first thing you could do is not follow your rules. You could, you know, let's say
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.200]   this rule, like the easy, easy trend following rule. Um, a lot of people uses, uh, moving
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.880]   average crossovers, right? You just, it's very boring. It's very stupid, you know, to
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.840]   the lead to the guy just watching. But let's say you have that 50 moving average crossover
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.440]   the 200 you buy when it crosses up, you sell and it crosses down.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.000]   So explain what a moving average crossover is, uh, and explain what that, what the market
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.560]   conditions would be when that's happening.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.840]   Sure. All right. So moving average is, let's say, let's say we take a 50 day, right? So
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.640]   we sum up, we take the average price of the past 50 days. All right. And same thing with,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.840]   with the 200, right? Take, take the average price of the last 200 days. All right. The
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.560]   200 day is going to, is going to react more slowly to price changes than the 50 would.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:38.080]   All right. Cause the 50 is taking a more recent average. All right. Um, I think that makes
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.880]   sense, right? It would change even, even it would be more, more sensitive if you took
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.520]   a 10 day, you know, that thing would wiggle around much more than a 200. What 200 is going
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.880]   to be very smooth. So these, these, the object of these moving averages to smooth the price
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.680]   trend out, right. Is to get the general direction of the trend, not every little wiggle. Um,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:07.280]   so when you have a market that's coming out of a bottom or it's coming out of a, of a
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:15.080]   long consolidation period, it start to, it start to drift upwards. Um, then you get this,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.720]   you get the, you get the 50 day crossing above the 200 day. Right. And a trend follower would
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:26.440]   say, okay, now the trend is up. All right. Now we have, now we have confirmation it's
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.560]   up. Um, so we take a long position with that and we're going to stick with that until it
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:38.080]   crosses down. Now, what you could do, right. Uh, to, to kill yourself as a trend following
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:45.480]   trader is to one, not take that trend. All right. So you, do you don't, you don't capture
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.160]   if it ultimately becomes a big winner. All right. You don't cat, you don't capture it
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.480]   or you say, you know what, this is wrong. I bet it's going to come down because I was
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.560]   on CNBC and all these guys are saying blah, blah, blah, that it's going to go down. This
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.000]   is not, this is not correct. And you know what? I was looking at the fundamentals too.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.440]   And the fundamentals, they don't support an uptrend here. This is, this is, it looks weird.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.720]   No, I can't. No, I'm actually going to short this thing. Cause I bet we're going to continue
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.080]   in this choppy period and it's going to bounce off of it's, you know, a lot of guys are going
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.680]   to take this signal. The momentum is going to run out and it's going to come back down.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   So, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to short this thing. Uh, you could kill yourself that
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.960]   way too, because you're again, putting yourself on the, on the wrong side of the, of the trend.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.400]   And um, you know, maybe you'll be right. You know, that's trading is not an exact science.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:41.800]   It's not physics. Um, so you could kill yourself sure by not taking the trend, missing out
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.360]   on a big winner, taking, you know, disobeying what, what the, what your strategy says in
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:53.320]   this case, taking the long by taking a short, God forbid you ever did that. Um, and stick
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.760]   with that trend. You stick with that loser if it keeps running up. Um, or, or you can
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:04.920]   get sloppy with your risk management, which is not a fun topic, but risk management is
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.560]   essentially position sizing, how big of a position you take, um, at all times. So some
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:17.360]   guys like to think they know everything and they get overconfident or overaggressive and
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:23.280]   they take too big of a position that, you know, that, that, that they can afford. And
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.760]   if they're on the wrong side of the trend, um, you know, they can lose their money pretty
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:34.120]   fast. Um, so say, you know, you budget for, you know, uh, every position you take, you're
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.520]   going to risk 1% of your capital on it. Right. So if you lose, you know, you lose 10 in a
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.280]   row, you lose 10% of your money. It takes you a long time for you to lose your money.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.040]   Right. Um, cause you're betting like a fixed fractional bet. Now, well you could, some
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.840]   guys could do is like, you know, I'm going to get away from that. I want a bigger position
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.000]   because I feel like this trend is going to be the mother of all trends. Like these gold,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.280]   like these gold bugs who think gold's going to go to 10,000 one day or something. So there
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.240]   can, they sit there with a massive, massive position. And, and then what happens? Like
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.000]   it goes down, they lose a ton and then they have to ultimately have to sit there. You're
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.480]   like, cause they don't want to move. They're like, well, it's going to go up someday. So
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.880]   I'm just going to keep buying it. So they, their risk manager gets sloppy because they're
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.160]   not cutting the loss fast. They're sitting with the loss or they're betting more than
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   they can afford to lose. And, uh, you know, God forbid you get into, you know, uh, the
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.120]   derivatives and the futures and stuff like that. You don't know what you're doing. You
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   lose your money really fast. Um, so, you know, for, for the trend following guys, they're
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:52.000]   really successful at it. They, they do their work to build a system of rules, like what
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.460]   markets to trade, when to buy, when to sell, how much positions to hold, stuff like that.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.000]   They have all these questions answered, like a system that would pass through NASA, like
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.400]   with flying colors. There's no, there's no ambiguity. There's no room for discretionary,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:16.440]   um, decision-making on the fly, stuff like that. So, you know, we do all this stuff before
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:22.560]   we ever commit a dollar. We do all this, we do all this research. We make sure we test
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:29.120]   all these rules and we do this for wherever we, we, we ever, uh, take a position in the
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.520]   markets before we ever risk a dollar, because we want to make sure we're know what we're
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.660]   doing and we know how this thing is going to work before, before we just start getting
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.120]   into the markets where, you know, that's, that's a not, that's not a fun or safe place
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.400]   to be with money on the line if you don't know what you're doing. Um, so then after
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.240]   we, you know, build a system that we're comfortable with, that we can follow, we, all our job
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.320]   is then is to execute the thing, execute it day after day after day, uh, through good
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.920]   times and bad. And, um, you know, maybe, maybe, you know, you do some research, uh, constantly
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.080]   to see if you can improve it, but this is not, these are not going to be improvements
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.800]   that you're going to be doing every day, every week, every month. These are like slow evolutionary
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.680]   type of improvements over years of, uh, of work. So, um,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:24.720]   So three follow up questions on that, which all go together. Um, number one, if this is
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.360]   a system of rules that you as a human being have pulled out, why do you think that you
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.600]   as a human being are able to see them? Wouldn't a computer, uh, algorithm be better at finding
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.160]   them and then, uh, adjusting them? Number two, which is associated, what, what value
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.120]   do you as a human being have going forward? If you're just going to put rules in place,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.520]   wouldn't the computer program be better at that? And then number three, why are you involved
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   at all when you could just automate the trading?
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:05.200]   Uh, okay. So starting off, we do use algorithms, you know, but the human has to find them and
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:12.840]   you know, really when you use the computer, the computer is just a tool to organize everything
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.060]   and make it simpler and make it faster. It's not, there's, you don't buy trend following
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:28.920]   or fundamental or any other trade trading strategy, uh, software on the shelf and, and
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.560]   just input it in and then just blindly and blindly follow those rules. Like, no, you
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:40.140]   need to, you need to, you need to go in. You still, it requires a human to find what works.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:46.720]   And then he uses an algorithm to make it easy to execute every day. You know, like if I
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:54.180]   had an algorithm for a, um, for a toothbrush robot to do my teeth while I didn't need to
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.280]   stand there and move my own thing while I did something else, I would do that because
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.120]   it would save me time. Sure. Like why do I need to stand there like an idiot for two
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:09.520]   minutes and move my hand back and forth in space, um, driving a brush against my mouth
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   like that? That's a waste of time and take it to trading. It's a waste of time to, to
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.240]   use my brain, right? Cause I'm not always going to be sharp, right? Computers always
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.760]   sharp, right? Um, it's like, like today I told you before we even started recording,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.540]   I'm a little foggy today. I might be off my game, right? The computer is not off its game,
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:38.400]   but the rules that I put into the computer are from me, but they're from me at the best
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.200]   version of, of my energy, right? Because again, the computer's not going to wake up today
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.520]   and be, be annoyed at something. Um, it's going to just do it. It's going to do it.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:57.240]   So that's a way of, of rerouting the, the energy to always be efficient. Right. Um,
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.760]   and I don't change the rules every day. Like if I use just myself, right, if I was like
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.160]   a discretionary guy and I was just watching TV and going through reports and, and talking
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:13.680]   to people and trying to get a feel of what's going on, that still doesn't, it still doesn't
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   tell me really with any consistently when, when I should be buying, when to sell and,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:29.840]   and how much risk to take. Um, you need to have a coded definite rule for each section
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.800]   of, of, of a trading system. So, so you know, so you could test it against like historical
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   data, you know, so you know if it works or not, you know, you need to know if what you're
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:48.040]   doing in, in real time works, you know, like we look at, you know, we don't have a, we
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:55.560]   don't have robot athletes now, but I bet you I could create, you know, I can, I can, I
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.640]   can gather all the mechanics of a, if I was going to go for a pitchers, gather all the
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:09.160]   mechanics of a, of historically great pitchers and create a robot that, that use the efficient
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.920]   mechanics and like, you know, obviously I can't, I can't make them play because you
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.360]   know, they don't do that. It's still have to do it through humans. But, but basically
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:25.800]   I create something like that where I can create a real, a real good version of, of a, of a
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.760]   trend following system, but just use the computer to execute it. That, that, that's all it is.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.680]   It's not, it's not, it's not like the compu, it's not like I don't know what the computer's
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.800]   doing. I told it what to do. So it's just doing it a much faster, cleaner way that I
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   could do it.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.560]   In the world of trend following, do you as a portfolio manager believe that your system
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.640]   is unique? Is it a proprietary secret unique to you?
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:02.160]   It's unique to me in that I believe only I could follow the rules day after day. I feel
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:08.120]   like any system, any rules, like you take like dieting, you know, there's a lot of diets
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.880]   that work, a lot of training regimens that work. You need to find what works for you
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.720]   because ultimately the only way to get the results of it is that you have to do it. And
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.080]   you know, whether you're going to be a trend follower, whether you're going to be a paleo
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:29.360]   CrossFit guy or a bodybuilder guy or whatever, whatever you look, whatever look and whatever,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.560]   whatever results you want, you're going to have to, you know, do your work to create
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.360]   something that's, that's yeah, unique to you.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.680]   Trend following is unique to me because I, I, I like to be on the right side of nature.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:50.240]   I like to, I like to obey natural law, natural principles that, that work everywhere, not
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.160]   in just trading. This isn't, trend following isn't specific to just trading. I like to
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:03.440]   say on a deep, deep level, trend following principles are not, it's not a training strategy.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:10.760]   It's a life strategy applied to trading. It could be, it could be useful anywhere. I always
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:16.680]   made, I believe I made the, on some other podcasts I've been on, the analogy to dating,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:23.760]   you know, you know, so trend following principles are, are pretty basic, but you can obviously
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.240]   apply them in many different ways. So the, the, the core principles are obviously to
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.860]   trade with the trend, to diversify, you know, to, to open yourself up to follow as many
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.880]   trends as possible. Don't, don't pigeonhole yourself to just be, oh, I'm a stock trend
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.960]   follower. Like why, you know, expose yourself to anything, you know, be able to capture
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.400]   trends in anything. And then, you know, so we have those two and then we have ride the
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.160]   winners, right? So we're sticking with what works. We're cutting the losses. We don't
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.880]   hold what doesn't, what isn't working. All right. So if we buy something and it goes
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.720]   up for a little bit and then it starts to fall, starts to fall, starts to fall. We have
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:10.520]   our exit point in there already. It says, all right, this isn't working out. So then
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.600]   we also have like the risk management, the you know, the position sizing, as I talked
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:21.880]   about knowing how much to bet per trade, how much open, open risk to hold in anyone position
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   at any time. And you have your limits for your position. You have your limits for your
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.280]   sector and portfolio. You can get really complicated with this stuff, but it's basically just to
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.560]   protect your ass, right? And don't bet more than you can afford to lose. That's, that's
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.060]   the day and bet enough to where that when you win, you're going to make some money.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.320]   And then like the rule of all rules, as I said many times, it's to stick to your system,
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.540]   to follow your rules. You have to do it. Like all the back tests, all the research in the
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.000]   world can tell you that it works, but if you don't do it, it's as good as dead. And you
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.540]   could probably, you know, everyone could probably identify with that and that they've tried
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.380]   many different types of diets and are training workouts and they do it for a week or a few
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.300]   weeks and they're done and they don't see any, they don't see any results.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.860]   Let's talk a little bit about your business. So you built the confidence, you built your
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.420]   model, you tested it, you said, "Hey, I feel good about this. I think there's some opportunity
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:25.500]   here." If you trained yourself to become such a hotshot investor, why didn't you just take
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.620]   and trade your own money? Why would you get involved in the professional money management
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.620]   side of things?
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.740]   I am not a hotshot trader.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.780]   I was trying to bait you a little bit.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.580]   No way. No way. I'm actually probably the most boring trader you ever set eyes on because
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:48.140]   most of the time just sitting around, you know, waiting for the rules to tell me to
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:56.100]   do something. You know, I'm not looking at, I have one screen and I look at the markets
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:02.780]   few times a day. That's it. I'm not making trades in today. I'm not a hotshot at all.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.300]   So this is a very boring calculated type of a thing.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.340]   So why wouldn't I trade my own money? Well, I started when I was 26, so I didn't have
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:19.940]   much money. And, you know, I don't know if I, like I hear a lot of old traders, right?
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.160]   They give the money back, right? They give back their client money and they just start
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:30.900]   to manage their own money over time. And I feel that this is maybe what's maybe unique
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.260]   to me is that I'm not, I'm in this for like the teamwork. I mean, sure. Like you can make
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.180]   money any number of ways. And if I was a money hungry guy, I probably wouldn't be running
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.540]   a fund nowadays because it's not that good of a business, right? It's a little harder
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.820]   to get clients to people for people to give you their money, right? People don't want
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.580]   to do that right now. They want to invest in startups. So if I was a money hungry guy,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.420]   I'd be probably getting into startup culture and stuff like that, right? Because that's
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:06.940]   the hot trend now. So, um, I like managing money for other people because when I was
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:12.820]   sitting back at bear during those big events, like when it went down and then at JP Morgan
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:19.060]   during the crisis, during the financial crisis in October, I thought, you know, this shit
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.180]   isn't going to happen to me. It's not going to happen to me. It's not having my friends,
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.900]   not my family. We're not going to be one of these guys running around here. It loses everything
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:35.300]   in 20 years. Like no, no way. And I wanted to take my team mentality that I had all my
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.980]   life, you know, with my, you know, playing on sports teams. And remember at that point
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.700]   I was a year and a half or something, two years of not playing baseball anymore. I,
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.940]   I missed it. I miss being with the guys, you know, miss being with my friends all day.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:56.180]   And um, I wanted to create that, but in a business, you know, I wanted to create a team.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.780]   I wanted to create a loyal tribe that guys that would follow me, that would, that would
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.500]   believe in me. And ultimately I was making, I was calling the shots on, on the trading,
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:11.580]   but, but we had to work together to make sure that they didn't quit out when I was struggling
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.140]   and that they weren't getting sloppy, like putting in all their money when I was doing
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:22.180]   well, you know, before the ultimate drop at some point later. So I, uh, you know, I really
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.060]   want, I started with that. I started, you know, like I wanted to protect my friends,
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.540]   my family and my own money first. And then, you know, later on, then we can get into maybe
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:38.900]   getting some bigger clients and stuff like that to, you know, like advance my financial
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.500]   status or something. Uh, but that's like, that's later. That's not, that's not what
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:49.600]   drives you. Um, I mean, I'm sure it is for some people and some, a lot of fun managers
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:56.100]   out there, you know, they're just like copycat, uh, type of fun managers that, uh, you know,
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.060]   all we got to do is just like hit up our boys, uh, raise a ton of money and slap two and
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.540]   20 on it. And we can have a couple of decent years and we're, and we're done. We retire.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.940]   See like for them, it's not about, it's all about the money, you know, and that, and they're
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.300]   not good. And it's like, no wonder they're not good. No wonder hedge funds suck today
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.060]   because they're all copycats. Like they're all trying to, trying to copy the mutual funds
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.880]   or this or that. And, and they're, um, they're not anything. They're not in it for anything
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.260]   other than, you know, trying to make a little bit more, right. Stuff like that, that that's
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:36.020]   not, I'm not about that. I'm in, I'm in this for, I want to know every one of my investors.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.100]   I want to know every one of my, um, you know, uh, if I have any coworkers or anything like
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.300]   that, I want, I want to know everybody. And I want to, and I want to know that everyone's
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.620]   in this. I don't want to have a team that, that is just bringing in accounts. I don't
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:57.060]   know anybody. And it feels like there's just names on a paper and I, you know, you know,
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:03.140]   there's no feel there. There's no, there's no like camaraderie there. And you know, that's
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.020]   ultimately what I loved about, about the sports game. You know, like, it's not just me celebrating
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:17.580]   by myself, you know, that's, that's miserable. Um, so that's, you know, that's why I got
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:25.300]   into this game. Um, and I believe that trend following in general is unique, um, unique
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.900]   in the world today because there's not many of us doing it. You know, there's, there's
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.380]   some of us, right. There's some big guys, there's some small guys, but generally trend
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:41.300]   following doesn't feel comfortable. It's, it, it's, it's painful to, to continuously
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:47.940]   cut losses, to, to, to say you're wrong, to, to bet hot, you know, to, to take positions
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.140]   that, that are high, you know, um, you know, that you don't see any value, right. You're
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:58.180]   just betting with the momentum, like you're, you're, you're, you're, you're betting things
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.660]   as they break out. And a lot of times things don't continuously break out. They come back,
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.020]   you know, they mean revert, you know, so you're betting, you know, you're how, how you win
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.060]   in this game is that you, you constantly cut losses.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.580]   Majority of the time you're losing, losing, losing, and you get occasional big winners
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:22.740]   and that's where you make most of the money is these infrequent, but large winners. And
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:27.700]   that's not comfortable to do to wait around and, and to sit through like people want to
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.260]   be active. They want to day trade. They want to, they want to get it right. They want to
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.380]   make 10 bets and be right. Eight times like that is not how it's going to happen with
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.580]   trend following. So I, because you're, you're, again, you're like, you're like a mini bubble
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.380]   catcher. You're trying to catch these little mini major moves.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:51.140]   Uh, and sometimes you get big, big moves, um, that, that pay you, uh, like, but it's,
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:56.660]   it's an infrequent payout type of a type of a game. And that's, and that's very difficult
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:04.540]   for human beings to, to do. Um, and, um, but I feel like I'm one of those unique human
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:12.660]   beings that, that like maybe most entrepreneurs, they, they love the pain. They love, they
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:18.420]   love going it, doing it themselves. They love, um, you know, if they have, if they have it
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:25.380]   be an army of one, we'll do it. Um, and we love doing the hard stuff that gets you to,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.820]   you know, the success, so to speak. So I feel like trend following is that, is that type
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.500]   of a strategy that, uh, it works just because most people can't do it, you know? And again,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.220]   in like markets we trade, we're not trading against physics. Like you, there's reason
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:46.340]   why there's no, there's no orbit markets because they go one way and they don't oscillate at
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:53.220]   all. Right. There's no, uh, you know, there's no rotation of the act on the axis markets.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.140]   Everyone's on, everyone's on the one side. Like, wow. And I take the other side. It doesn't
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:02.980]   spin any other way. Right. Um, but in markets you're treating it, you know, other people,
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:11.220]   you know, like some guy, I think it was cool saying, uh, in physics you're trading against,
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.900]   you're trading against God. And in the markets you're trading as God's creatures and God's
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:26.100]   creatures are like, you know, irrational. They're very different. They're different.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:31.420]   So we don't, uh, you know, when you play a game that doesn't abide by the laws of physics,
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:37.060]   you know, things go back and forth, back and forth. Um, it's, yeah, that's a tough game
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   because you know, you'd like for everything to be smooth. But if that was the case, there'd
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.580]   be no markets. Yeah. I've got, I've got some, some, some questions that touch on important
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.500]   themes that I want to get to before we run out of time. So, um, consider these a little
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.140]   bit more rapid fire questions. Uh, you don't have to give a 10 second answer, but one to
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:47:00.620]   two minutes. What is your most memorable trade from the last year or so? I, I'd have to say
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:08.740]   oil. Um, last year. So yeah, oil. I mean, I've got short oil in July of 2014. Uh, I
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.620]   know that cause my dad, uh, asked me one time and I told him, and that was the year I got
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:19.460]   engaged. Um, and I didn't know at the time that that'd be the start of something big,
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:28.660]   but, uh, 70, 60% later, um, it was, it's been a big winner. Um, and that same process I
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.140]   take every other trade, like, Oh, I don't know if this is going to work, but I got it.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.580]   I got to take it and let's see if it works. Uh, some of them work out and a lot of them
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:42.820]   don't. And this one did. And, um, yeah, it was the most memorable, memorable because
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.940]   everyone likes to talk about oil. Like, like, like they like to talk about gold. Like it's
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.660]   like the only two commodities that anyone knows. Um, Oh, what's oil doing? Oh. And,
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:57.420]   and, and oil affects everybody cause everyone drives. So, uh, you know, as we've gotten
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:03.380]   later into the cycle now, like as oil has gotten down to the twenties or thirties or
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.740]   something, um, everyone started to text me, call me, Oh, we still, you know, are you in
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.300]   this oil? I'm like, yeah, I've been, I've been in oil for a year and a half. Yeah. You're
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:19.940]   long oil now. No, no. Yeah. Yeah. Not, not as not in the same, um, aggressiveness, like
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:26.660]   I'd say 20% of the position that I, that I did have like still short it, but 20% of the
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:32.500]   size, not, not, not, not as, not as short, but, uh, but yeah, it's most memorable. And
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.300]   it's weird because going back to the physics thing and the market, like God's thing, you
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:43.260]   know, when I see everyone starting to call me and text me and becoming aware of the,
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:49.500]   the, uh, severity of the trend, I say, Oh, this is over. This is going to end because
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.860]   everyone's caught on now. Right. And when you get everyone on the one side, unlike physics,
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.460]   it goes the other way in the markets like that. And that's like, you know, that's, that's
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.540]   like the poker read stuff like that. That takes a lot of experience. I think to start
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:08.140]   to get good at that, like I would never base them a training system on like making reads
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.220]   like that. That's too hard. Wouldn't base it. But I think it's important for people
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.820]   to recognize it. And I'll give two examples that, that one, a historical for me, one very
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.900]   current. Um, when I was, I met a bunch of people in real estate and one of the guys
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:26.940]   that, um, this is back in about, uh, mid, mid to late two thousands. I forget the exact
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.740]   timing, but he was telling me the story of how he had made a killing in real estate and
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:37.660]   how he had gotten out of stocks in 2001, 2000 or so. And his reason for getting out of stocks
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:45.060]   was that he, um, he, uh, I had a taxi driver who the first thing they started talking about
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.180]   was how much money they had been made, made on their Apple stock or whatever the tech
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.760]   stock was. And he came home and said, if I, if a taxi driver in New York city is giving
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:57.380]   me stock advice, I'm out and just, and sold everything. Well, unfortunately he was telling
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:02.780]   me the story, but then he went on to lose a bunch of money in real estate cause he didn't,
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:08.860]   he didn't take into account that same indicator. If my house, if my maid or, or, or, uh, you
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.860]   know, the guy who works on my car is telling me about how much money they're making in
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.900]   real estate and the poor guy didn't pay attention. But I noticed that trend just a little bit
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.580]   of, Hey, everyone, everyone's getting into real estate, so therefore we've got a problem.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.820]   But I think it's more interesting to practice, not necessarily with those big ones, but with
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.380]   other, with other things. I'll tell you the current one current as of March, 2016, we're
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:36.540]   recording this is Snapchat. And what's been funny is I've been watching, I'm, I've never
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:41.020]   really used Snapchat. It wasn't really, it was started with such a young thing, but I've
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:46.300]   been watching, uh, I've been watching the marketing people talk about how important
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:51.040]   it's going to be for an, for a year, um, for over a year. And now it's been a, it's been,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.260]   some of them have been talking about it for longer, but I've been paying attention for
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.940]   a year. And now what's funny is still the early movers are just starting to catch on
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.820]   and my newsfeeds are flooded with little yellow ghosts everywhere. People saying, follow me
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.540]   on Snapchat, follow me on Snapchat. And so I share that with the audience to say, watch
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:12.860]   it and recognize it. And, um, there's a point in time at which with all trends, you can
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.380]   see it a lot of times with these technology trends that you're just in your normal life.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.920]   There's a point in time at which it's useful to you to get on in line with the trend. Sometimes
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.080]   it's useful to you to be an early mover. Sometimes it's useful for you to follow it, but pay
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.760]   attention to what people are talking about and you can see these things, uh, whether
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.660]   it's an oil, real estate or Snapchat.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:41.780]   Yeah. Um, and yeah, I think if you're an investor in Snapchat, it's, it's, you know, uh, granted
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.820]   probably the dynamics of the risk reward a little different because it's less liquid.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.900]   There's not, there's not as many participants that hold the stock and all that stuff, but
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.260]   you get these like hyper growth things that like, you know, you're not going to invest
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:02.580]   in oil and it's not going to be a 40 X move. Like, no, you know, it's, you don't buy oil
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.420]   at a hundred and it goes to, you know, 4,000. Right. That doesn't happen unless you were
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:13.900]   like in hyperinflation or something. But, um, you can get those psychotic moves in,
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   in these, in these, um, these budding startup companies. But, uh, but yeah, I mean a lot
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:26.900]   of times they're, they're a little frothy and, uh, and they come back to zip.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.520]   What's the biggest mistake that you've made recently and how did it happen where you lost
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.380]   a bunch and you just totally were surprised? What was it and how did it happen?
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:48.540]   Biggest mistake I think, um, well I never, I never disobey my rules. Right. But, um,
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:55.540]   but there are, there are things that, you know, research wise that I feel like I, I
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:00.300]   could, I could be, I could have implemented a little earlier. So, so it's something like,
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:06.780]   um, we can, we can stick with oil. Um, so you know, if you're just, if you're following
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:11.980]   right now, I treated about 40, 40 markets, right. And about four or five of them are
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:19.580]   energy markets. So let's say you give each market the same, the same risk, right? You're,
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.060]   you're saying, okay, well I'm going to treat every market the same. And whenever I get
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.140]   a signal, I'm going to bet the same amount across the board. I'm not going to be biased.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.540]   Right. I'm not going to say, oh, I'm going to bet two on oil and one on gold and three
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:35.820]   on stock. Like, no, it's all gotta be the same. It's like, uh, you know, it's the same
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:45.380]   bet throughout. Um, so if, when you do that though, you limit yourself, right. To per
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:53.940]   se, you, you create where the number of markets you trade is where you're going to have the
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:59.860]   risk. Right. So if you have five Mark five energy markets inherently, when you get signals,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:04.980]   you're only going to have 5% of your, your, your risk in, in those markets. Right now,
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:11.740]   what happens if they become the best performers, right? You may want a little more, right?
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:17.300]   Sure. And, and what happens if they become highly correlated? Uh, you know, if they're
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.060]   still trending, that's a good thing because you got one big position crushing it. But
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:26.540]   ultimately at some point, you know, they may all start to go against you, you know, later
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:32.220]   on. So you gotta be, you know, you careful. So I started just training very, very, you
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:39.420]   know, primitive where it was just, like I said before, trading basing one, um, one,
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:46.940]   uh, flat percentage bet for each market, not incorporating this correlation stuff, um,
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.180]   or, uh, aggressiveness of the trend stuff to where like you're like rel using relative
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:56.300]   strength and things like that. So, so over the past year and a half where I've done well,
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:02.340]   you know, being short oil and other energy markets, I would have loved to have been more
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.180]   short, right? Because that would have meant like there was some of the other 35 markets
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.740]   that weren't doing much of anything, but I was still giving them their equal chance to
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.700]   do well now, not cause I don't want to reject any trades either. Cause you don't know what's
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.140]   going to be the next big, you know, you don't want to be in a point where you reject any
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:26.340]   trades. So while I held this position and energies like, damn, like I'm taking this,
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:30.940]   this is like the, you know, I'm hold, I'm sure I'm doing okay, but I've been taking
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:35.460]   this stupid position, cotton and cocoa and all these other markets that are not doing
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.780]   anything. I keep getting whipped out. Like I should really should have just been allocating
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.980]   more, um, of, of my capital to the, to the ones that are already winning and winning
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:53.300]   big. So that, that was a big, like frustrating point of mine. Um, point that I, I, I knew
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:58.860]   and now I know of, of ways that I could have had more, um, without sacrificing the diversification
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:03.140]   end without saying, all right, well, all right, we gotta, we gotta take all the, take all
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   the allocation from these other markets and give it to oil. Like, no, I don't want to
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:13.900]   do that, but I know I can, I can at times, um, get a bigger position in the ones that
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:18.660]   are winning, um, then, uh, then the other ones that are kind of whipping me out back
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:24.660]   and forth, back and forth. So, um, yeah, that, that was annoying, but I know it's just, it's
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.900]   all a learning process, right? You know, it's like, okay, well next time I'm going to, I
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.900]   incorporate this stuff, um, into my, into my system now. And you know, you get, you
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:43.460]   get more, you just, you get better at, um, allocating your funds to the trends better,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.340]   right? Like in the past I was open to all the trends, but now I'm going to be more,
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:53.660]   um, you know, still open to everything. But when things really start to prove themselves,
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:59.980]   um, I'm going to be in a position to, to take more of a position to take advantage. That's
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:00.980]   all.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   Pretend, um, pretend that I'm a boglehead and I'm just long head. Yeah. I always bogglehead.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:14.860]   I'm a longterm. I just held index funds. I don't do any trading. I'm a buy and hold index
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:20.980]   funder. Uh, and you're trying to, uh, you're trying to say, Hey, listen, you ought to consider,
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.660]   uh, taking some of the money out of the index funds and investing it with me. What are some
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:29.300]   of the key points that you would touch on that would, that I would consider in making
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.300]   that decision?
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:36.900]   Sure. Well, you know, with passive investing on any one market and if you're doing it on
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:44.020]   stocks, okay. Um, just realize that every so often you're going to lose a lot, you know,
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:50.780]   it's going to go down. Um, and it may take you years for you to get back to your old,
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:58.180]   your old, uh, account value. Um, it's, you know, we just lived through 2000, 2015 where
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:06.340]   essentially, essentially went nowhere after all the taxes and the fees. Um, so, you know,
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:12.700]   if you can stomach living with an investment strategy like that, that you're susceptible
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:18.500]   to maybe 10 years of no gains, uh, I would say, I said, okay, go for it. Um, especially
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.940]   if you're younger, you know, fine. But, but at some point, you know, you don't want to
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:31.460]   be in a position where you're going to get older or where, or when you need them ability
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:37.460]   and that's going to wipe out half or 30% or more of my money. Um, and I'm going to be
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.900]   damn now I wanted to buy that house. Now I can't buy it because now I got 30 or 50% less
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:48.340]   in my accounts. You know, that's not a good business plan, you know? So with trend following,
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:54.980]   because it's a, because it's different and because it's, it's, um, a non correlated return
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:01.580]   stream, right? It makes money differently than a buy and hold would. Um, when you combine
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:06.820]   them to whatever degree, you know, like if you say, all right, I'll keep, I'll keep,
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:14.500]   uh, say you went half and half, right? Um, you, you're getting two different types of
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.660]   players. It's like, like building a lineup. Like you don't have a lineup of power hitters
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:23.820]   only or lineup of slap hitters only you want, you want some power here is you want some
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.940]   average here is you want some slap hitters and you want some contact guys, you know,
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:32.380]   like you want all different things. So you create a smoother, uh, return stream for yourself.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:36.860]   So you have, you have more stability. You're not, you're not more, you're not susceptible
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:44.580]   to, or you're not as susceptible to a, to a sudden major loss or a, or an extended period
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:50.580]   of no gains. Like you, like people just had and stocks. Um, so when you incorporate this
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.420]   stuff, you're, you're opening yourself up to one profiting from trends in different
[00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:00.260]   markets. You know, if you're just trading stocks, it's one market, one, um, and one
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:05.900]   country. Um, but when you open yourself up to maybe a trader like myself or another trend
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:11.460]   follower, a diversified guy, um, you're, we're trading dozens of markets in all different
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:18.260]   sectors and all different countries, all different continents. So one, you're more open to, to
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:24.940]   catching trends if, and when trends go cold in your stock portfolio, right? Like, Oh,
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:28.220]   well, you know, that that's fine. That things are cold here because things are hot over
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.340]   here and now we just moved our money. So now we're, now we're, now we're doing well over
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:42.280]   here. And also trend following has the inherent, inherent, um, uh, mechanism to cut losses.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:48.100]   If you're a buy and holder, you're sitting with your losses. Like you, you never get
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:56.140]   out. Now there's easy times to when things start to roll over, right? Um, to where you
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.620]   use like, like the moving average, we talked about before, like when you get out and you
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.660]   protect your ass, you because maybe it will, maybe it's a false signal. Maybe it does,
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.220]   you know, give you a short signal and it comes right back up. Like in damn, like you missed
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:13.340]   out on the bottom or something. But in those, like I said before about the infrequency of
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:19.460]   those major trends, most of the time you may be right, holding it might be the right thing,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:27.420]   but sometimes it won't be. And you can't afford to lose half or more of your money. Um, for
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.300]   any reason, like that's just not a good business plan. You shouldn't be, you shouldn't open
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.580]   yourself up to that. Like that, that to me seems silly and unnecessary. Like you don't
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:41.220]   need to do that. You don't need to play that way. Um, so you know, if people can't get
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:47.420]   past there, Oh no, I just always hold stocks no matter what. Um, and which I may add that
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:53.500]   all stock indexes are trend following systems. Um, they're not very good ones, but they,
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:00.340]   they are in that they they're diversified, uh, throughout the stock sector. They, they
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.620]   allocate, um, more of the weight to the, to the winners, uh, and they allocate less to
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:10.500]   the, to the losers. Um, so they are inherently a little bit of a trend following system.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:20.020]   So, um, anyway, um, you know, so when you combine these two ideologies, these two philosophies,
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.980]   these, you, you get, you get different return streams and when you combine them, you get
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:29.180]   a more, you get more of a smoother, smoother, um, you know, performing type of a thing.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:34.960]   You get more, as you say, you improve the risk reward, right? So one way to, one good
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.340]   way to measure risk, uh, I would say reward in relation to risk is what I like to use
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:46.780]   is the, uh, the MAR ratio, which is the compound annual returns divided by the max loss, right?
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:52.020]   A lot of guys like to use the sharp, which is the compound returns divided by the standard
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.700]   deviation, the annualized standard deviation. But you know, standard deviation could be
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.140]   positive, right? You can have deviation on the upside and that doesn't, that doesn't
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.620]   make much sense to me. Um, so other guys may use like the Sortino, which is just the downside
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:13.220]   deviation, but I like to use the max loss because that, that is where, that's where
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:17.620]   the edges are. That's where people lose their discipline was when they start losing money.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:23.020]   And if they, you know, if they lose too much, um, that's when they start to quit. So, so
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:32.420]   like typically, um, you know, just to like compare like risk reward ratios, um, like
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:42.260]   buying hold typically has 0.1 to 0.3 is there is there a ratio like a stock like the SMP
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:49.660]   has about seven, seven and change compounding returns over many, many decades with 50 plus
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:56.080]   percent losses. If you go back to 29, you know, it's like 80, 90% loss. So their, their
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.540]   risk reward isn't that good over, over long periods of time during pockets of time, like
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.420]   in the past five years, it's been insane. It's been great, right? You have a 200% run
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.660]   up with a 10% loss, like max loss. That's, that's awesome. Right? That's very good. But
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:18.020]   over long periods of time, um, that's where that ratio sits that 0.1 to 0.3 now, but diversified
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:26.060]   trend following, um, systems, uh, they usually have MARs of usually 0.3 to 0.7 and they,
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:33.260]   they achieve higher, um, higher risk reward, um, ratios because they're not sitting with
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:39.180]   these big, big losses at times, right? They're cutting losses. So it takes, it takes more,
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:44.420]   it takes more of a, um, of a consolidation type of a period where a lot, you get a lot
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:50.140]   of strings of losses in a row to really, uh, to really kill a trend follower. But the,
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:55.300]   the, the thing is, because, because of how markets work, things consolidate for periods
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:59.860]   of time and then they run, things run for periods of time and then they go back to consolidate,
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.460]   you know, so all you got to do is get through the windows of time where things aren't that
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:09.580]   good, uh, without, without much loss. Um, and you do that by cutting them and not betting
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:15.820]   aggressively, uh, or, or, or over aggressively, um, to where you get to that next set of trends.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.060]   Um, now it's, it's a different philosophy and it's, it's a different, it may seem more
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.020]   common sense to, to some people like, oh yeah, why would I want to buy and hold stocks ever
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:31.420]   any, anymore? Um, I don't know. I don't, I don't do that. All my money is in my phone.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:36.020]   So, um, two, two final questions here and these are kind of going to be, these are going
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.580]   to lay you up nicely to mention your, your websites and your fund. Uh, but they're sincere
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:46.740]   questions, um, but they are going to lay you up nicely. Uh, why can't I just do this myself
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.180]   or can I just do this myself? If I want to learn trend following to trade my own portfolio,
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:56.660]   can I just do it myself? Yeah, absolutely. You can. I mean, and, and you know, if you're
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.460]   committed to it and you know, going back to the dieting and training, you need, you need
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.420]   to have the discipline to do it. If you're that guy, great. If you're looking for a cheap
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.620]   way out, you're probably not that guy, you know, because you're probably not going to
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:15.500]   do it. You know, like what, what's, what's, what sucks about a personal trainer is that
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:24.260]   he can't do it for you. You know, a, a personal trader with a D can do it for you because
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:30.060]   I don't need to be in your body to do, to do the things like, you know, so if discipline,
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:36.100]   uh, is a big issue for you and for most of the humans it is, and for most of the human,
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.980]   like discipline is for me an issue on things I don't really like, you know, like I'm not
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:44.940]   going to do this, I don't like it, you know, I'm going to give up on it, you know, but
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:50.900]   things that really into I'm doing it, I'm in it, I'm committed. Um, so, you know, for
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:56.500]   most investors, they're, they're not usually the committed ones. They're, they're, they,
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.420]   they just do it because, um, they were sold on that's where they should have their money.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:07.900]   So if that's, if, if you're a passive investor, um, which is, which is cool. Um, passive at
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.500]   a lot of things, um, investing, not being one of them, but if you are, then, then, then,
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:20.380]   then you may consider, you know, outsourcing your, your investing to a disciplined human
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:25.700]   being, a guy who's into it, a guy who's on top, a guy who has his money invested in his
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:33.300]   own strategy, right? A guy who has personal interest in doing well. Um, and you know,
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.420]   that, that's the service I provide for people, you know, not everyone, not all my investors
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:42.700]   want to do this. You know, a lot of them could, I could teach this stuff to my mother or to
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:50.820]   my 10 year old cousin. It's not hard to do. It's not hard to, to grasp the principles
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:56.460]   and to actually create a system, I don't think. But, but in the hard part is doing it day
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:00.780]   after day after day after day. It's like, and you got to do it forever. I'm sorry, you
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:06.820]   can't take any days off. You know, that, that, that's where you start to lose the cell. You
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.220]   know, it's like, oh, I don't do that.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:16.100]   >>So in that line, and, and, uh, uh, I'm running up against another interview scheduled after
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:22.460]   your, I'd, I'd probe you as far as how you learned it, but let me close with this question.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:29.820]   If you, I've, I've avoided and talking about things like rates of return in order to, to
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:35.060]   keep you free of disclosure requirements, uh, things like that with, with the financial
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.220]   regulatory agencies.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   >>Yeah.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.620]   >>So that's, if any audience is listening, that's why I haven't asked those questions
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.220]   of like, how much did you make last year, et cetera. Those types of claims need all
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.380]   kinds of regulatory documents associated with them. I just want to ask you this question.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:54.840]   If I wanted to bring money to you and say, Hey, listen, Michael, will you please manage
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.260]   it for me? How do you want to be judged by me as a client? Do you want to be in by, in
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.820]   my examples are, do you want to be judged simply based upon my total return? Did you
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.100]   beat the S and P last, last year that I could do better within what then what Vanguard did
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:12.020]   for me? Do you want to be judged based upon limited downside? Do you want to be judged
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:16.180]   based upon less volatility? How do you as a portfolio manager, what do you think is
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:21.140]   a fair criteria and method to be judged by your clients?
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:30.220]   >>Uh, I say when people come to invest with me, I say, I don't, I don't require, but I
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:38.460]   recommend you stay invested for at least three to five years. Um, so you can get enough,
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.580]   you can get enough time, get enough, uh, get enough trends under our belt to, to compare
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:51.140]   ourselves to maybe the other options out there. Um, and probably, you know, I'd say compare
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:58.460]   me or judge me on my one absolute returns over the time period. Let's say it's, you
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.980]   know, three years, five years or something, um, versus other, other asset classes. And
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:08.580]   then, and then base me and then compare me and judge me on the, um, like I said before,
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:16.860]   that, that MAR ratio, um, how have my returns been relative to my losses? Um, because a
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:24.860]   lot of guys can, you know, maybe have a real, real high MAR ratio, but their absolute returns
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:31.020]   aren't high. It's like, well, you know, I want, I don't want an MAR of one, but returns
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.100]   of 2%, you know, that's, I don't want, I want like bigger returns. So then it's like, okay,
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.780]   we need to need to factor both in. I don't know how you want to weight them or whatever,
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:50.060]   but, um, you know, and I would say also it's in pockets of time, you know, comparing yourself
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:55.940]   versus versus other guys, it can get dangerous because there's always something that's going
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:01.060]   to be doing better. You know, most of the time, a trend following is usually never going
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:10.500]   to be the number one, uh, asset class because it's usually, it's usually an average or,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:19.340]   or a little bit of a, um, of a non pure, uh, all in bet. You know, it's the best all in
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:24.500]   bet over the past year. It's probably like Netflix or something that went up like 200%,
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:29.780]   but you don't, you don't like, you don't want to start a Netflix fund, you know, because
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:34.500]   it, that, that's going to end that ride's going to end. So comparing yourself to, to
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.100]   like a stock or something, it's like, well, Mikey, why do I need you? I could just invest
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:43.820]   it all in Netflix. Like, well, yeah, dude. I mean, but that's, that's one opportunity.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:49.740]   That's one trend in a short amount of time. Like, do you have any evidence, any research,
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.860]   anything that, that, that suggests that that's going to continue? Um, and that's a viable
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:00.260]   investment strategy is like, I'm just a buy and holder all in bet on Netflix. Like if
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:09.980]   yes, okay, go, go have a ball bro. But like if you want a, a stable, a more, a well researched
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:16.260]   thing, a system that is not susceptible to major sudden losses, then, then you may consider
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:20.660]   something else. I mean, with, with a little bit more diversification and, and, and more
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:26.580]   rules and stuff like that. But, but yeah, I mean, I, I value myself. Um, I, I judge
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:32.700]   myself on, on those two things. Like I want to achieve at least, at least double digit
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:39.940]   returns and I want to achieve an MAR of at least a half and that, that, those are my
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:45.700]   goals. And, and if I do those things for you, then I, then you can tell me, you know, job
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   well done, but now go do it again and again and again for the years coming up. Uh, but
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:57.300]   that, that, those are, those are my goals with, with my returns. Um, I don't want single
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.820]   digit returns. Like, uh, I'm young and most of my investors a little more aggressive.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:06.580]   So we, we shoot for bigger, bigger numbers. Um, you know, we were willing to take some
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.780]   of the volatility, but we're, we're also willing not to take that much. We want to be efficient
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:18.620]   with it. So efficient with our, with our strategy. So, um, that, yeah, I mean, again, double
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:28.380]   digit returns is what I, what I want. Um, you know, 12, 15, 20 at times. Um, and then,
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:35.020]   and then keeping the downside volatility to about, uh, you know, um, to like double those
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.460]   numbers, you know, so if I, so if I achieve, I achieve like 10% returns, I only want to
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:46.780]   be taking max losses of 20%. You know, I achieved 15. I want to be capping them at 30, you know,
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:51.380]   stuff like that. Um, that, that, that's what I want. I don't want the stock buy and hold
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:59.260]   thing of 7% returns with 50% drops that, no, that's not, that's not efficient to me. There's
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:03.940]   a better way to do it, at least in my opinion. And that's why, that's why I do it this way.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.260]   Awesome, dude. You got two websites. You have a, a personal website. We'd talk a little
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.740]   bit about finance, a little bit about you at Michael melissinos.com. I'll link it. So
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:18.100]   it's spelled properly in the show notes, but it's M E L I S S I N O S.com. And then you
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:23.580]   have your firm's website at melissinostrading.com if anyone's interested in, in, in checking
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.060]   into some of that. Anything else that you'd like to share with the audience here as we
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.060]   close?
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:36.140]   Uh, no, I just say, just be honest about, about your investing. Like in order to do
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:42.540]   really well, the reason why the best investors, the best traders are the best is that because
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.300]   they've fully committed to their style and they know their style and they follow their
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.100]   style every day. They don't, they're not wishy washy. They're not going back and forth on
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.380]   their discipline. They're, they stick to it even when it's not fun. And disclaimer, most
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.380]   of the time it's not fun.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:01.100]   Welcome to the world of investing.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.860]   It's not, it's not supposed to be fun. It's just supposed to work. So, um, you know, that,
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.740]   that's what I'd say. Just be, just be honest with yourself. If you can't do it yourself,
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:15.100]   no big deal. It's not, you're not less of a man, less of a woman because of it. It's,
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:20.140]   it's perfectly normal, perfectly probably the smart thing to outsource things that you
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.220]   don't want to do and that you can't do as well. No big deal.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.100]   Sweet. Dude, thanks for coming on the show.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:30.380]   Thank you so much.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.860]   Investing is something that really almost anybody can learn. If you're listening to
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:38.900]   a show like this and if you understand that you have an interest in it, well, I promise
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:44.260]   you, you can learn it. Uh, Michael can learn it. You can learn it. I can learn it. I do
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:49.940]   want to point out and just demonstrate to you, notice how the investment business works.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:54.180]   Notice how a guy like Michael, uh, if you remember the question that I asked him, he
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.580]   builds a skill and then he goes and applies that skill to help other people. And that's
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:03.980]   how the investment business works. It provides in a tremendous way for investment advisors
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:08.140]   to build wealth while bringing a service to the marketplace. That's what all of us do.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:11.940]   We go and we learn a skill and then we take that skill and we work to bring it to the
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:16.300]   marketplace to build our own wealth. And in the case of investment management, it's
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:22.420]   very clear you get to use other people's money, profit from it in the form of fees while hopefully,
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:28.940]   hopefully growing it. And that could provide the foundation for your own fortune. Consider
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.980]   if there's something in your industry, in your business, but it might be investing,
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.540]   but consider if there's some way that you can apply that concept in your own business.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:40.820]   Hope that's useful to you. Thank you for listening to today's episode of the show. If you'd like
