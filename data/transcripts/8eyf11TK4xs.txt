[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   We are considering, as most of you will recall, the words which are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.200]   epistle to the Romans in the ninth chapter from verse 19 to verse 24.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   Let me read these verses again as they constitute a complete argument in and of themselves.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.320]   Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will?
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.080]   Nay, but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God?
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.120]   Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hath not the pot out power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.120]   honour and another unto dishonour?
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.080]   longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, and that he might make known
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.440]   the riches of his glory, and the vessels of mercy, which he had aforeprepared unto glory?
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.560]   Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.920]   Now, as we have seen, what we have here is this objection that was being brought against
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.320]   the teaching of the apostle, as he has put it before us, from verse 6 to verse 13.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.600]   He has already raised a previous objection in verse 14, and he has answered that and
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   dealt with it.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.760]   But that, in turn, seemed to raise a further objection, and that is the objection which
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   we have in verse 19.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.080]   And there the objection is, Why doth God yet find fault for who hath resisted his will?
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   The apostle had been saying that the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.640]   have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.440]   throughout all the earth.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.600]   And he has concluded, Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   he hearteneth.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   And the objector says, Well, very well then, if it all is in the hands of God, why doth
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.280]   he find fault?
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.800]   What right has he to condemn anybody?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.160]   And now the apostle goes on in these verses 20 to 24 to deal with his reply to that question.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.360]   Let me remind you hurriedly again of how we have subdivided and classified this reply
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.040]   of his.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.600]   It goes into various sections.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.360]   The first is, of course, the first half of verse 20, Nay, butto men, who art thou that
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   replyest against God.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.480]   That is just a rebuke to the questioner for asking this question, Why doth he yet find
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.040]   fault, since nobody could go on resisting his will?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.920]   There is the rebuke to the questioner.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.600]   Then in the second half of verse 20, 20b, if you like, and the whole of 21, he goes
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.880]   on to make an assertion and to give an explanation of God's sovereignty and entire freedom in
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.320]   what he does with fallen humanity, both in the matter of saving some and of rejecting
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   others.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:35.280]   Then in verses 22, 23, and 24, he gives us a possible explanation, at least what he regards
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:46.040]   as the explanation of why God thus, in his sovereign right and power, should curse some
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.960]   and should bless and save and show mercy to others.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.880]   Now that is a general classification of this reply which the apostle makes to the question
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.920]   posed in verse 19.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   Now last Friday night we had time only to deal with the first part, which was the rebuke
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   of the questioner.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.480]   "Nay, but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God?"
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.400]   And we brought out this tremendous sarcasm that is involved there, the contrast between
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.800]   man and God.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.520]   That is the thing, of course, that the apostle was anxious to do.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.920]   We worked that out together and we justified the apostle in answering in this way.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.600]   What he is really saying is this.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.800]   He is not saying that we should never ask any questions at all, but what he is saying
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.160]   is this, that we should never contend with the plain teaching of God's word.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.000]   We should never argue with God.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.600]   We can express our difficulties, and if we do so in the right spirit, we shall be helped.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.760]   But what we must never do is to begin to contend with God, to argue with God, and especially
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   in this spirit that suggests that God is unrighteous or unfair or unjust.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.600]   That is what he condemns in total.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.520]   And the scripture, of course, always everywhere does the same thing.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.840]   Now then, having done that, we can proceed to the next step in the apostle's reply,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.760]   namely the portion which is found in the second half of verse 20 and the whole of verse 21.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   Now here the apostle asserts God's right, God's sovereign right, to show mercy or to
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.440]   harden as he wills and as he pleases.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.480]   Now that is what we have got in this particular part of the argument.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.360]   It is an assertion of God's right to do this.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.080]   Now let us follow him as he does so.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.240]   Let us take first of all the second half of verse 20.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.040]   Having rebuked the questioner, he says, "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.640]   'Why hast thou made me thus?'"
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.560]   Now then, what is the significance of that?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.320]   Well, you notice he is carrying on, in a sense, the rebuke which he has already given.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.400]   And he does so in a manner which shows the utter absurdity of our attempting to question
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.560]   or to query what God has done.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:39.000]   But at the same time, he also defines yet more clearly what he has already hinted at
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.880]   as to the relationship that exists between God and man.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.560]   Now this, of course, is something which is absolutely vital.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.120]   Of course, we dealt with this last Friday night.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.000]   It was all there implicit in this contest between man and God.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.760]   The New English Bible, so-called, uses the word "Sir," but that is not the thing at all.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.960]   The word used by the apostle was "O man."
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   And you do not get the force of it withoutâ€”he is not saying "Sir," he is saying "Who art
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   thou, O man?"
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   That is the emphasis.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.960]   But that is actually the original.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   It is not "Sir" at all.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.040]   It is "O man," to show the creatureliness of man who thus pits himself against Almighty
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   God.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   Now, the apostle, I say, is so concerned about that that he rarely repeats it in this further
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.160]   section.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:43.720]   And it is, of course, vital to this whole position with which we are dealing.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.860]   Let me repeat it because it is so important.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.080]   This is not the statement of the apostle Paul.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.340]   He has been quoting Scripture.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.480]   And if you disagree with this doctrine, you are not disagreeing with the apostle Paul,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480]   still less with me.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   You are disagreeing with God.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.640]   That is what the apostle is saying.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.800]   In other words, what he is telling us to do, as we saw last Friday night, is this.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.000]   When you come to any part of the Scripture, take off your shoes from off your feet.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   This is not Shakespeare.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.880]   This is not Euclid.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.320]   This is not a textbook of philosophy.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.120]   This is God's Word.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   And you approach this in an entirely different manner.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   You take your shoes off your feet.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.960]   You realize that all your learning and all your abilities have no help to you at all
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   when you come here.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.000]   You have got to become, as a little child, you need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.160]   In other words, a man who tells us openly that he sits in judgment on any part of the
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.000]   Bible is a man whom I would never expect to understand doctrine.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.680]   He cannot possibly do so.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.560]   And of course he does not.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.360]   Those are the people who deny the doctrines of the Christian faith and do not even see
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   the need of them.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.280]   As they are the authorities themselves and their own understanding and not the Word of
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.320]   God, well, one does not expect them to understand.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:12.880]   And so one expects from them the blasphemies that they admit so confidently.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.360]   But we, I say, must come here in the spirit that the Apostle teaches us.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.920]   Take off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   Who art thou?
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   O man, remember who you are and what you are, your finite, limited, sinful condition, and
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.480]   remember that you are dealing with something that God himself, the Almighty, has revealed.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   Very well.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.040]   I say, he presses that home upon us still further.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.760]   And this is how he does it.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:46.760]   Having reminded us of our creatureliness as just men, he now says, "Shall the thing formed?"
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.720]   Say to him that formed it, "Why hast thou made me thus?"
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   Oh, yes, a further putting of us in our place and in our position.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.960]   Remember he says that you are nothing but the thing formed.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.640]   And that means, let me remind you, plastic material.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.920]   That's what thing formed means.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   You are just the plastic material, he says.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.520]   Does the plastic material say to the man who molds it, "Why have you made me thus?"
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.080]   Now this is the most interesting term here.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:26.040]   Let me impress upon you the importance of observing that he doesn't say the thing created.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.800]   He says the thing formed, not created.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.160]   You will see the significance of that in a moment.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   He's here describing men as something that has already been created.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.840]   It's plastic material.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.680]   He's not starting with nothing.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.400]   He's not talking about the bringing into being out of nothing.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   That's creation.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.240]   No, he says here, here is a mass of plastic material which is going to be formed and which
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   has been formed now.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.960]   That he says doesn't turn to the one who's formed it and put it into shape, "Why hast
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   thou made me such?"
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:07.640]   Now then, there is a distinction between creation and the forming into shape of a mass of plastic
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.800]   material.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.600]   And then, of course, what he is doing, you see, is this.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:23.640]   As man's relationship to God is that of this lump of plastic material to this artist who
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.240]   forms it into shape, is there anything in the world that is more ridiculous and more
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:38.640]   absurd than for this helpless mass of substance to try to question and to query the one who
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.760]   has put it into shape and to ask the question, "Why hast thou formed me thus?"
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.040]   And his point is that that is exactly the position of anybody who, coming across this
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   doctrine which says, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated," asks God, "What
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.960]   right have you to do that?
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   On what grounds can you justly do this thing?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.400]   On what grounds do you condemn anybody to damnation?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.160]   On what grounds do you choose anybody to mercy and to salvation?"
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.600]   He says it is as ridiculous and as monstrous as that.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.920]   And let me remind you that even there, the apostle is not putting forth his own ideas
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   merely.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.640]   He is there once more quoting the Scripture.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.400]   So you see, the Scripture answers the questions all along.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.320]   But he just puts it there in the form of a question to show how utterly ridiculous and
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.280]   absurd and monstrous the thing is.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:46.680]   "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, 'Why hast thou made me such?'"
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.600]   Ridicule.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   The thing is entirely absurd.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.720]   But let's go on.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.680]   In verse 21 he takes it a bit further.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.320]   He takes up this idea that he has introduced there and he elaborates it and he works it
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.360]   out still more clearly and plainly and explicitly.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.920]   And of course he has only got one object in doing this.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.040]   People coming to this passage, as I have been showing you week by week, are always trying
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   to explain it away.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.240]   They try to get rid of this notion that we are taught here that God chooses some to salvation
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.760]   and he rejects others.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.600]   They say, "This is impossible.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   It's unjust.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   It's unfair."
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.240]   And they try to say that he doesn't say that.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.920]   That it simply means that God in his foreknowledge knew that one man was going to believe and
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   not the other and so on.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.200]   Well, of course, if it were that, as I am pointing out, there would be no objection
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.400]   to it at all.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.080]   But it isn't that.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   And these terms he is using now about the thing formed and the one who forms it and
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:55.720]   what he is coming on to now in verse 21 makes any such attempt to get out of the difficulty,
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.560]   something which is altogether futile.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.840]   Very well then, here it is.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.280]   He puts it still more explicitly.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:12.880]   Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honour
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.440]   and another into dishonour?
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Now surely that's plain enough.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.320]   The relationship that he is describing between God and mankind is the relationship between
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.160]   a potter and a lump of clay.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.560]   Now then, in other words, this is so plain and explicit and clear that there is no way
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.880]   of dismissing what the apostle is saying.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.680]   And there is our contrast once more.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:54.960]   Man, God, thing formed, the one who formed it, clay, lump, potter, the great artificer.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   Once more it is very important, it seems to me, that we should be clear about this, that
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   the apostle still is not putting forward his own opinion.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.640]   He is once more quoting from the scripture.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.280]   And in order that this may be quite clear to everybody, let me read the scriptures to
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.520]   you that he is obviously quoting.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.920]   The first is in Isaiah chapter 45.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.120]   Let me read to you verses 9 to 11.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:29.760]   Isaiah 45, verses 9 to 11.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.720]   Woe unto him that striveth with his maker.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.320]   There it is.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.280]   Woe unto him that striveth with his maker.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.800]   God forbid that that woe should come upon anybody who is in this gathering at this moment.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.840]   Don't strive with your maker, my friend.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.240]   Woe unto all who do that.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.560]   Let the potter strive with the potters of the earth.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.920]   Then here it is, shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, what makest thou?
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.320]   Or thy work he hath no hands.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.600]   Woe unto him that saith unto his father, what begettest thou?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.160]   Or to the woman, what hast thou brought forth?
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.760]   See, that is the question at the end of verse 20.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.120]   Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his maker.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.480]   Ask of me things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   Command ye me.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.040]   Well now, there it is.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.320]   The apostle obviously has got that in his mind.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:44.000]   But surely also he has equally in his mind Isaiah chapter 64 and verse 8.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.820]   This of course is the cry that came up out of the heart of Isaiah when he was pleading
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.800]   for revival.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.400]   But now, O Lord, thou art our father.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   We are the clay and thou our potter.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.120]   And we all are the work of thy hand.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.040]   Same idea exactly.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   And then you get it in Jeremiah also in chapter 18 verses 3 to 6.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.520]   Well let's go to the beginning of the chapter.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying, Arise and go down to the potter's
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.000]   house and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.680]   Then I went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.920]   And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.480]   So he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.400]   Then the word of the Lord came to me saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.160]   this potter, saith the Lord?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:58.600]   Behold as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:04.440]   So that you see here the apostle is not as it were as a brilliant philosopher or debater
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.600]   or arguer trying to prove his doctrine of election saying, no the position is this,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.120]   man to God is just like a lump of clay in the hands of a potter.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.120]   It isn't that at all.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.000]   He's quoting scripture.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   He is quoting what God himself has said upon this matter both to Isaiah and to Jeremiah.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.240]   He is quoting at the same time what Isaiah had clearly understood as being this relationship
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   between them.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.520]   Well now then, here of course as you all must realize is a statement about which a
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.080]   people have argued and contended throughout the centuries and as I have reminded you before
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.640]   have lost their tempers and become bitter and violent and entered into party spirit
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.520]   and have refused to speak to one another and so on.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.400]   What a terrible thing.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.080]   What a terrible thing to do with any statement in God's word.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.960]   I am much more concerned about our attitude to this than about anything else.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:12.080]   I would say once more if you cannot discuss a passage like this in a calm, collected,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.320]   reasonable, humble spirit you have no right to look at it at all and you will certainly
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.840]   never understand it.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.800]   The spirit is absolutely essential and vital.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   Now what does it mean?
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   Well, let's look at the terms.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.200]   Doth not the potter power over the clay?
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.760]   What does he mean by power here?
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.640]   Well he chooses a word which means authority, right.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.760]   Now let me prove that to you.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.280]   Look at the next verse, 22.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.560]   What if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known?
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.360]   Now here in this authorized version we have got the word power in both instances but in
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.240]   the Greek there are two different words and the word he uses in 21 is the word that generally
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:06.000]   stands for authority whereas the word in verse 22 means dynamic.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.680]   It literally means force, physical power as it were, but not here.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.080]   Here it means authority and right.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.920]   So what he is saying is this.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:22.460]   Has not the potter the right and the authority to do as he wills and as he chooses with that
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.000]   lump of clay?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.280]   To make one vessel into honor and one to dishonor.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.200]   His picture is that of a potter making various utensils and implements for household use
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   and so on.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.040]   He says some of them are put to very honorable uses.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.080]   The others are equally necessary but they are not quite so honorable.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.800]   He calls them dishonorable.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.480]   There are things which have to be used in life.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.760]   Some you put onto the table and they are shown.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.800]   Others are kept out of sight but they are very necessary.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.320]   It is the same sort of distinction as you have in 1 Corinthians 12 where the apostle
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.720]   in dealing with the various members of the body says that some are less comely than others
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   but they are all in the body.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.360]   They are not all like the face and like the eyes and like the hands.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.000]   There are other functions in the body.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   We do not talk about them.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.600]   They are out of sight but they are absolutely essential.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.400]   Some to honor, some to dishonor.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.120]   Some comely, some less comely.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.200]   Very well, all he is saying is this.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:23.040]   The master potter has the right and the authority to do as he wills and as he chooses with that
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.880]   mass, that lump of clay.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.440]   To make one vessel into honor and one to dishonor.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.600]   Very well, but what does he mean by that?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.480]   This is where we come to the crux of the whole matter.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:45.760]   He does not say that God has created some people to honor and some to dishonor.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   He does not say that.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:53.200]   He is not talking, I remind you again, about creation.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:01.120]   He is not saying here that God Almighty created some people in order that they might sin and
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   go to damnation.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.880]   On what grounds do I say that?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.000]   Well the terms that are actually used not only entitle me to say that but they compel
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   me to say that.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.480]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.760]   The terms are perfectly clear.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.120]   Now we have already seen that he uses this term about plastic material.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.000]   That is why I made a point of that.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Shall the plastic material say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.240]   I pointed out, you remember, that he does not say the thing created say to him that
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   formed it.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.800]   He says the plastic material.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.720]   But now here we go still further.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.640]   He talks about clay and he talks about lump of clay.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:57.460]   In other words, the figure that the apostle is using is not the figure of creation.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.320]   He is talking about something that is done with material that has already been created.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   Now that is absolutely vital to the whole case.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.840]   Creation I would remind you again means creating out of nothing.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.960]   And in creation you start with nothing.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.560]   But here we are starting with plastic material.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.820]   We are starting with a lump of clay.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:30.640]   And what the apostle is arguing through his figure is this, that God in his relationship
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.320]   to men in salvation is in the same position as the potter to a lump or a mass of clay.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.480]   The potter does not create the lump of clay.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   He starts with it.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.240]   It is there in front of him.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.880]   There is the lump of clay on the bench.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.800]   The potter comes along and is now going to do something with it.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.520]   Very well then, why am I emphasizing this?
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.840]   What does it teach us?
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:01.080]   Well what it teaches us is this, that the apostle is not dealing here at all with God's
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.240]   purpose in the original creation of man.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.720]   Well what is he dealing with?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:13.440]   Well he is dealing with God's relationship to form humanity.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.680]   You see, he is concerned here only about salvation, not about creation.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   And he puts it in this kind of picture.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.320]   Form humanity is like a kind of lump of clay.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   It is already there.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:37.720]   And what he is discussing is what God does with this lump, this mass of form humanity.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.240]   He is not saying what God does with human nature as such.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.400]   Nevertheless, as I say, is he dealing with what God did at the original creation.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.680]   Because at the original creation, what we are told is this.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   It is the exact opposite here.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   Look at it again.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.080]   "Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.360]   and one unto dishonour?"
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.340]   And that is in interpretation, remember, of Jacob of I loved and Esau of I hated.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.920]   Or it is in terms of what God did with the children of Israel and what he did to Pharaoh
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.480]   and his hosts, which we have already been looking at.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.240]   Now then, why do I say that this is so essentially different from the original creation?
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.120]   Well, for this reason.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.640]   That in the original creation, it was not only creation from nothing, but still more
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:35.280]   important, God created men in his own image and likeness.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.680]   That is the opposite of dishonour.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.440]   God made men in his own image and likeness.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.760]   He looked upon men as he looked upon the whole of creation, and we are told that he saw that
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   it was good.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.840]   God never created anything unto dishonour.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.880]   But here we are dealing with a potter who makes one vessel unto dishonour.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.620]   Well, that proves, I say, that it cannot be dealing with human nature as such.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.860]   It is still less dealing with men as he was made at the beginning.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:14.180]   It is an account of what men do with fallen humanity.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.360]   Now there is the key to the whole explanation of this statement that has mystified so many
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.900]   people.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.340]   They get hold of the idea that God deliberately made some people that they might go to hell.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   That is a lie.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   It is not true.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.700]   It is not taught anywhere in the scripture.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.100]   What the apostle is dealing with here is what God does with fallen men and women, and that
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.660]   is true of the whole of humanity.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.300]   The lump of clay is not humanity, it is fallen humanity.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.580]   It is humanity as the result of the original sin of Adam and of Eve.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.020]   Now Charles Hodge puts this very well when he puts it in these words.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.940]   We are dealing here, he says, with God as moral governor, not as creator.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.940]   That is it.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.900]   Moral governor, not as creator.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.380]   Now of course, in putting it like this, the apostle is simply stating in other terms what
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.460]   he has already been stating all the way from verse 6.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.900]   You see, there we were introduced to this whole question of these two sons of Abraham,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.100]   Ishmael and Isaac.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.780]   And you remember how we interpreted that.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.900]   They both, you see, are children of Abraham.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.100]   They both come out of the same lump, as it were, out of the same stock.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.780]   That is Abraham.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.580]   There is the same lump, the same lump of clay, but you remember we saw that out of that same
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:43.260]   lump God formed one to dishonor Ishmael, formed another to honor Isaac.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.580]   Both were inheritors of fallen humanity through Abraham.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.060]   Both were in the same position.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.020]   They were in the same lump.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   Fallen humanity.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.140]   That is the thing right away through.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.180]   The same with Jacob and Esau.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.860]   Still more obvious, because they were twins, the same lump.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.940]   Fallen humanity, both of them.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:09.580]   But out of that, one is formed to salvation, that is Jacob, the other is formed to damnation.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.460]   There is the thing that the apostle is saying right away through from the beginning of the
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.340]   argument at verse 6.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:25.140]   And all he is saying at this point is this, that God has a right to do this.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.540]   Let me put it like this.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.660]   This is the only thing under consideration here.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:38.700]   And what the apostle is asserting is this, that the whole of humanity, everybody born
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:48.260]   into this world from Adam, is already lost, is already under condemnation, is already
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:59.260]   in a state that deserves damnation, everybody, but that God chooses some to salvation and
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:05.140]   others he hardens and consigns to perdition.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.420]   And others he hardens and consigns to perdition.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.260]   And all he is arguing here is this, God has a right to do that.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:19.140]   As the potter has a right to make one to honor and one to dishonor out of that lump of clay
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:25.540]   that is in front of him, God, he says, has an equal right to choose some to honor and
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.340]   consign the others to dishonor.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.820]   On what grounds do you say that he has a right?
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.980]   Well, here are the answers.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:40.100]   All deserve damnation as the result of the sin of Adam.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.340]   Now, you remember that, don't you?
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.140]   That is proved in chapter 5, verse 12.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.900]   "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.940]   passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.220]   There it is.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.700]   We cannot go back to prove that again.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.220]   It is proved there abundantly.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.660]   It is the teaching of the scripture everywhere.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.500]   We all sinned in Adam, and the sin of Adam is on us all, and we are all receiving the
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.500]   condemnation.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.420]   We are all born in sin, and we deserve damnation as the result of it, the sin of Adam.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:20.460]   But not only that, we deserve it also as the result of our own deliberate choice, as the
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.260]   result of our own deliberate sins and disobedience.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.460]   But I want to go further.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.580]   Nobody deserves mercy, not one.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.860]   Is there anybody here who would like to claim that he or she is deserving of the mercy of
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.180]   God?
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.540]   Give me your grounds for saying it.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.620]   There is none.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.220]   We none of us deserve mercy.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.900]   We have no claim upon the love of God whatsoever.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.260]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.220]   We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.700]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:03.100]   The whole world lies guilty before God, and nobody can dispute it.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.880]   Very well, there is our position.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:14.780]   We not only deserve no mercy, we have no claim upon God to give us mercy.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.980]   That is the lump of clay.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.940]   And all the apostle is therefore saying is this.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.300]   Surely God has a right therefore to do what he likes with this.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:31.220]   If he condemned the whole to perdition, nobody would be able to voice a single complaint.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:38.840]   But if he chooses to make some unto honour and some for salvation, why shouldn't he?
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   Why shouldn't he?
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.880]   Hasn't he a right to do what he likes with his own grace and mercy and compassion?
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   Nobody has a claim.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.480]   Nobody can bring any complaint.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   We all deserve hell.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.440]   If God chooses to show favour to some, why shouldn't he?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:32:00.120]   Of course the thing is so monstrous, because we, you see, as men and women, are constantly
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.520]   doing this very thing.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.680]   And if somebody tries to take from us the right to do what we like with our own, we
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   become furious.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.480]   That is why most people dislike communism.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.000]   They say it takes everything from you.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.720]   You can no longer do what you like with your own.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.520]   And they think this is most unjust and iniquitous.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.720]   But they are not willing for God to have that position.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.760]   You see how utterly illogical we are.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:32.720]   God, the Almighty Creator, says the Apostle, he has a right as Creator, as Judge, as Sovereign
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.240]   Lord.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.680]   He has complete freedom and right to do as he wills and as he likes.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.480]   And that is precisely what he does, says Paul.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:50.640]   With this lump of fallen, sinful humanity, he has, from the very beginning, according
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.360]   to this principle of his, this God's purpose, according to the principle of election, in
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:02.760]   verse 11, he has decided to choose some to honor and some to dishonor.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   Hence your Isaacs, hence your Jacobs, hence your children of Israel.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.000]   Very well, that is the statement that the Apostle makes.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.880]   Now I do want to have this quite clear.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.960]   No one is created evil.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.120]   It is inconceivable.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.000]   God created all things good.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.600]   No one was created evil.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.960]   No one has ever been forced to sin.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.720]   "God neither tempteth any man with sin, nor can be tempted," says James, in his first
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.040]   chapter in verse 13.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:50.840]   Mankind, in its representative and its head, Adam, who was perfect and sinless and had
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:34:03.640]   complete free will and complete freedom of choice, rebelled against God and sinned.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:10.800]   And so, as I have reminded you, we have all fallen and sinned with him, because we all,
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.480]   by nature, are in Adam.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:22.320]   And what the Apostle is dealing with here is what God does with humanity in the light
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.600]   of that.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.920]   And he says he has an absolute right to do as he wills, in his own sovereign will and
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:36.160]   lordship, with such a hopeless mass, which could be all consigned to perdition.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:43.400]   He has nevertheless, because of his grace and glory and his purpose, chosen and elected
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:52.320]   to form some out of that unto glory and honor, and others to perdition and to dishonor.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.400]   Well, I say, that is the whole argument, you see.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:01.440]   That is what he did once more in Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau, children of Israel,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.920]   and Pharaoh and his hosts.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.640]   Now that, and that alone, is what the Apostle tells us here.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.120]   He does not go any further.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.280]   And I can tell you why he does not go any further, because he could not, he does not
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   know.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.560]   You see, what you want to ask at this point is this, isn't it?
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.840]   Why did God decide to do this?
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.240]   How does God decide to make one unto honor and one unto dishonor?
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.880]   There is only one answer to that.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.800]   I do not know.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   Nobody else does.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.840]   But I will add to that, you have no right to ask your question.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.320]   That is the ultimate mystery.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.000]   I cannot go beyond the Scripture.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.920]   And all the Scripture tells me is that God does that, and that he has a right to do it.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.640]   And that if I raise the question as to whether he has the right to do it, I am being not
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:55.080]   only a fool, I am calling upon my head woes from God, for I am trying to contend with
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   my Maker.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   That is all I know.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   I cannot go further.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.240]   We must not even inquire.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.600]   So let me put it to you like this.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.720]   This is the teaching.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:17.760]   If any man is saved, it is entirely because of the mercy and the choice of God.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.440]   I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:30.680]   Therefore, he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.200]   So that I say, whenever a man is saved, a man who is a Christian, is a Christian for
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.920]   one reason only.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.760]   It is because of the election of God and the mercy of God.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.920]   He was in that lump of perdition, that mass of perdition.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.820]   And if you are out of it tonight, it is entirely because of the mercy of God.
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.180]   But I add this.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:03.740]   If a man is lost, it is entirely his own responsibility.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.740]   How is that?
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.580]   Well, because it is a part of his inheritance from Adam.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:13.120]   He is responsible in Adam, as you and I are responsible for things that the government
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.700]   of Great Britain did perhaps a hundred years ago.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.180]   You cannot dissociate yourself.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.460]   We are responsible for the sins of our forefathers, for the actions of our country.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.900]   We are responsible in that way, but on top of that, we are responsible because we have
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.380]   confirmed what Adam did.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.300]   We have all done it ourselves also.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.280]   Adam sinned as our representative, but we have all sinned in turn.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.660]   Every man chooses to sin deliberately.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.620]   We have not been forced to sin, we have wanted to sin.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.380]   We have done it deliberately.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:54.020]   We went against conscience, we went against law, we have sinned when we have sinned deliberately.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:38:01.740]   But on top of that, every man who does not believe the gospel is rejecting the gospel
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.500]   and its offer of salvation deliberately.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.460]   So we put it like that.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.340]   If a man is saved, it is entirely of the mercy of God.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.460]   If he is damned, it is his own responsibility.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.980]   That is what the apostles teach.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.860]   That is precisely the teaching here.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.780]   It came out in our teaching concerning Pharaoh.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.220]   God hardened Pharaoh's heart, Pharaoh hardened his own heart.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.860]   I showed you that there was no contradiction there.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:37.580]   Well, now that is the teaching of the scripture at this point, that God has this complete
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:45.900]   right and freedom to do as he wills with this mess of humanity that has sinned against him.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.420]   He chooses to save some.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.820]   That is the marvelous thing.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.380]   And he chooses not to save the others.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:59.780]   And for his own purposes, as we have seen and as we shall yet see, he sometimes hardened
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.380]   those others in order to display his glory and his power through them.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.420]   That really does not come in, does not make any difference at all.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:14.420]   The vital thing is that he chooses to save some and send the others to the perdition
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.060]   and the damnation that we all so richly deserve.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.780]   Now then, as I close this evening, let me put it to you like this.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.540]   Perhaps I should not be doing this, but I am trying to help.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.300]   This I say is a great mystery, the mystery of God's eternal will, the principle on which
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   he does this.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   We do not know.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.620]   All he tells us is, "Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated."
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.940]   And he did that while they were both still unborn in the womb of their mother.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.060]   Now this is a mystery.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:50.020]   And natural man objects to this.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.860]   He feels it is wrong.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.220]   This is the sort of thing that they like to say, don't they, in the newspapers, that they
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.660]   do not believe in that.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.860]   Some of them foolishly say that they are looking forward to going to heaven and they would
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.220]   like to have half an hour with the apostle Paul and put him right on some things.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.420]   Now that is an exact quotation.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.660]   That is an exact quotation of what a man said in a Christian pulpit here in London a few
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.660]   years ago.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:22.900]   The same man who has uttered the blasphemies reported in the Daily Mail this morning.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.100]   They do not understand this, you see.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.460]   And so they express these blasphemous opinions.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:35.780]   But I want to show you how utterly inconsistent they are with themselves and with what they
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.140]   really believe themselves.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.340]   They object to this, you see.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.740]   They say, where is free will?
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.740]   Where is man?
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   Where is man's responsibility?
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.020]   Well, I have shown you where man's responsibility is already.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:52.140]   I say a man is responsible for his damnation, he is not responsible for his salvation.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.100]   But let me show you how inconsistent they are.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.100]   What is it these people really believe about man?
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.580]   These scoffers against the Bible, these scoffers against Christian doctrine.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.380]   What do they really believe about man?
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.900]   Well, I can tell you what they believe.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.380]   Why does man act as he does?
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.980]   How do you explain man?
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.200]   Well, there are only three ultimate explanations.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.060]   One is called contingency, that there is no rhyme or reason in anything.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.580]   It is all accidental and haphazard.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:32.060]   The second is the doctrine of necessity, which sometimes goes under the name of fate.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.100]   Ah, they say, there it is.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.100]   You cannot help it.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.100]   You are fated to do it.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.100]   It is far like that.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.100]   And it is fate and necessity.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   That is a very common belief in the world.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.260]   Determinism, that everything is determined and that man is not free at all.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.580]   Now, I am quoting now what non-Christians believe.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.620]   And there are many subdivisions of this doctrine of necessity or determinism.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.540]   Now, take the Communists, for instance, the followers of Karl Marx.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.820]   How do they explain man?
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:09.300]   Well, they say that man is to be explained in terms of what they call dialectical materialism.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.680]   It just means this.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.340]   They say the whole of history can be explained in terms of capital and labor, demand and
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.340]   supply.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:25.660]   That is the supposed discovery of Karl Marx, that he discovered this dialectic, that you
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.020]   can explain the whole of human history, and therefore the lives of individuals, in terms
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.020]   of this conflict.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.300]   There is the master, here is the servant.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.580]   Capital, labor, demand, supply, and so on.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.660]   And that this has determined the whole course of history.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.660]   They believe that.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.180]   They are determinists.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.940]   They do not believe that man is free.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:52.940]   They say man is a slave of this process, which they are trying, of course, to help along.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.140]   And they say it is happening inevitably.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.740]   And ultimately, the whole world will have evolved through this process until you have
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.820]   that perfect state.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:08.140]   The bourgeoisie shall have arrived, the proletariat and so on.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.940]   There will be the classless state, and there will be no capital and labor, there will be
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.940]   no masters.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.820]   We will all be the masters.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.980]   That is one view of this determinism.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.900]   But here is another, the biological view.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.940]   I do hope you are getting the force of this argument.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.620]   These are the arguments you see.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.700]   These are the things that are believed by people who object to this teaching of the
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.580]   apostle Paul, because they say that means that man cannot do anything about it.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.580]   Where is man's free will?
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.740]   But that is what they really believe of men at the same time.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.420]   Some of them believe it in terms of this biological view.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.660]   These are very scientific.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.460]   These say that what a man is, is determined by various glands in his body.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.460]   I have put this to you many a time before.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.020]   They are quite serious.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:00.820]   They say that the relative proportions of your thyroid gland, pituitary gland, suprarenal
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.060]   glands and so on, determine what you are.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.220]   They have no difficulty in explaining Hitler.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:10.020]   He had too much suprarenal gland, where your adrenaline and power comes from.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.940]   Well, all right, I agree, I agree.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:18.980]   It is very funny, but this is taught quite seriously, quite seriously.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   And so you can explain your Shakespeare's, your Beethoven's and everybody else.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   What you see is nothing but the result of the interplay of these biological forces that
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.980]   are within him.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:35.100]   But there is one other, and this is the interesting one.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:44.180]   The explanation of men and his behavior given by Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, the
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.620]   one that the supposed great psychologist follows and whose teachings he has been giving from
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.880]   Christian pulpits.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.580]   This is what Freud teaches.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.340]   And now I am going to give you a quotation.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.660]   From the Reith lectures that were delivered just before Christmas by Professor Carstairs,
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.660]   you remember.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.080]   You saw something about it in the papers.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.780]   This man who criticized the Christian church for putting chastity before charity, as he
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.780]   puts it.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.340]   And he is one of these Freudians, like so many of these people are.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.260]   Now this is what Professor Carstairs actually said, and it is a correct statement about
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.960]   Freud and his teaching.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:27.880]   He says, "The confusion which prevails in popular thinking about the concepts of determinism
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:34.220]   and personal responsibility contributes to this partial eclipse of moral values."
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:39.460]   He had just been giving figures to show the appalling increase in the number of people
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   in our prisons.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:46.180]   It has gone up three times what it was before the war, three times what it was in the hundred
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.580]   years before the war.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.180]   He then gives figures about juvenile delinquency and so on.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.620]   Now he is trying to explain this.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:56.260]   And he says, "The confusion which prevails in popular thinking about the concepts of
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:03.340]   determinism and personal responsibility contributes to this partial eclipse of moral values.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:14.140]   By showing how often our apparently deliberate actions are in fact determined by motives
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:23.100]   of which we are unaware, psychoanalysis has undermined our confidence in the reality of
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   free will."
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.440]   And it is quite right.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.740]   It has.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.260]   If you follow the teaching of Freud and these psychoanalysts, you cannot possibly believe
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.260]   in free will.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.260]   Why not?
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:40.540]   Well, he says, "What a man does, what a man thinks, and his reactions and his behavior
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.820]   are determined by what?"
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.220]   Well, they are determined not only by the characteristics of his father and mother and
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:52.420]   grandfather and grandmother on both sides, but also what happened to him when he was
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   yet in the womb, also what happened to him when he was being brought up as a child.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.180]   Now you are going to laugh again, but these things are put forward seriously.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.300]   Professor Carstens actually mentioned these things in his lecture.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.500]   It depends partly whether he was a breastfed or a bottle-fed baby.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:19.660]   It depends also upon the way he was treated in the matter of hygiene by his mother.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.540]   Was she one of these people who was over-concerned about cleanliness of her baby, or wasn't
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   she?
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.180]   Those are the sort of things which are going to determine how a man is going to behave.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:36.140]   And then, of course, all these experiences in early childhood when he is yet unconscious,
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:42.540]   these dawning sex impulses and so on, those are the things that determine how men and
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.940]   women behave.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.740]   That's the teaching of psychoanalysis.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:53.900]   And I was quoting here one Sunday night what another of them said, who said quite seriously
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:48:00.340]   that the only hope for the future of this world is this, that children should be brought
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:07.780]   up by parents and school teachers who themselves have undergone a process of psychoanalysis
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.540]   and who have been rid of these things that have been hampering the forward march of the
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.340]   human race and liberated it into a new way of living.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.740]   It's the only hope.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.980]   And it must happen to them while they are children, because the child is the father
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   of the man.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.420]   Well, now there it is, you see.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.460]   All I want to try to do to help you is this.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.060]   That's the alternative to the teaching of the Apostle Paul.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.020]   Don't talk to me about free will.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.100]   There's no such thing.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.980]   There is no such thing as free will in fallen men.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.460]   The Bible teaches that.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.980]   Freud teaches that.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.340]   All these people teach that.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:51.380]   You see, what we have got here is the doctrine of certainty, not contingency, not necessity,
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:57.820]   but it is certainty, the certainty of that which is produced by God.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:03.200]   Let me give you one final argument before I let you go.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.060]   People seem to think that if you reject this doctrine of Paul, that then you are in a happy
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   position.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.180]   You say, "No, I don't believe that it's God who elects and that whom he wills he hardens
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.500]   and whom he saves, he saves.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.620]   I can'tâ€”a man must be free.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.940]   It must depend upon man's own choice, upon man's decision."
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.540]   Well, very well, then, wait a minute, let's look at it like this.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:28.740]   Let me show you where you are if you reject the doctrine of Paul, as taught here.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.660]   Take that verse we read at the beginning in Acts 28, 24.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660]   Here is the Apostle Paul.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.780]   He has gathered the Jews together into his private lodging in Rome, and he preaches
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.100]   the gospel to them.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:45.460]   And this verse tells me, "And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.460]   not."
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.500]   Very well, there is the problem, isn't it?
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.700]   Why do some believe and some believe not?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:58.620]   There were Jews, all of them the same, same background, same everything.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.140]   Some believed, some didn't believe.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.780]   How often has it happened in a family?
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:07.340]   Two brothers, same father and mother, same home, same upbringing, went to the same school,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.220]   went to the same chapel, went to the same Sunday school, everything the same, hearing
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.460]   the same gospel.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.660]   One believes, the other doesn't believe.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.580]   What decides it, what determines it?
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.620]   Ah, it's something quite simple.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.620]   Free will.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:28.140]   Very well, one chooses to believe, the other chooses not to believe.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.860]   And you think you've finished when you've said that, but you haven't.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.980]   This is the problem that you leave with me and with all the psychologists.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.620]   But why is it that one chose to believe and the other chose not to believe?
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.380]   I want to know that.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.380]   Why?
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:47.140]   Why did some believe Paul's preaching and why did some not?
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.980]   But you say, the one chose to believe and the other chose not to believe.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.980]   I know, but what I want to know is this, what is it that makes a man want to or want not
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   to?
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:05.140]   Oh, well, you say, well, that's how he saw things, and the other one saw them in a different
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.140]   way.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.380]   Yes, but you still haven't helped me.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:12.900]   Why does one of them see it like this and the other one like that?
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.860]   You see, you must ask these questions.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:23.260]   Well, I'm told, well, I don't know, one of them was like that and the other was different.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:30.260]   All right, but tell me, why was one like this and the other different?
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.660]   Let's go further back.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.660]   Why?
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:40.060]   Well, you say, well, he must have been born like this and the other born different.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.940]   All right.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.940]   Are we responsible for the way in which we are born?
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.400]   Are you responsible for the nature with which you were born?
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.460]   Are you responsible for the ability with which you were born?
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.140]   Of course you're not.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:52:02.100]   You see, if you reject this teaching that we have here in Romans 9, that's where you're
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.100]   wrong.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.980]   It is utterly accidental.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:10.380]   One man believes, well, because he happened to be born like that, the other disbelieves
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.060]   because he happened to be born like that.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.660]   He doesn't control it.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:22.620]   The vital question is this, what is it that determines a man's will?
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:27.620]   And the moment you ask that question, it comes back to one of two things.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:34.180]   It is either God's purpose or else.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:41.380]   It is pure accident, matter of glance, matter of upbringing, a thousand and one factors
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.180]   entirely beyond our own control.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:50.340]   In no case have you got free will.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.100]   There is no such thing.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:57.740]   Ever since men fell, the only man who has ever had free will was Adam.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.100]   And we know what he did with it.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.620]   Since then there has been no free will.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:04.060]   We've all been born in sin.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:08.100]   We are shapen in iniquity.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:18.820]   And what makes any man a Christian is the purpose and the will and the choice of God.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.740]   Now then, I've only said that to try to help.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.380]   I perhaps shouldn't have said it.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.100]   But I do it in order that you may see the position that you're in if you reject the
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.100]   teaching of the apostle.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:34.460]   For you're not only rejecting the teaching of the apostle, I would remind you, you are
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:39.340]   rejecting the teaching of God himself.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:47.580]   And it's not surprising that the alternative is complete chaos, utter contingency, sheer
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.100]   hopelessness.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:59.060]   Though it may masquerade at times in terms of some blind fate or some mechanical deterministic
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.060]   necessity.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:07.460]   Well, may God give us his spirit and give us the grace to look into these marvelous
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.220]   and mysterious things.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.860]   We haven't finished the argument.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:29.060]   If God willing, we will go on to consider the remainder next Friday evening.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.980]   We have all sinned before thee and against thee, and especially in this matter that has
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.180]   been before us.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:41.140]   We have come with the self-confidence of our little minds and so often in the wrong
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.380]   spirit.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:49.300]   Lord, we thank thee that with thee there is mercy that thou mayest be feared.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:57.500]   And we thank thee more than ever that we are in thy hands and that we are what we are by
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.220]   the grace of God alone.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:04.020]   Lord, receive our praise.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:12.860]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:20.580]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:28.260]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:37.380]   shall be in the glory and seeing him face to face and being filled with amazement more
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:46.140]   than ever and telling the story saved by grace.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.700]   Amen.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:52.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
