[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780]   - Hi, I'm Ken Ham, CEO of Answers in Genesis,
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.800]   The Creation Museum, and The Ark Encounter.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.600]   One of my favorite verses from the LSB
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.400]   is Genesis 1:5, and the reason for that
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.160]   is because it translates it correctly.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.840]   We read this, "And God called the light day,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.560]   "and the darkness he called night,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.120]   "and there was evening, and there was morning one day."
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.600]   That's the correct translation, one day.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.120]   It's defining the word day.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.000]   That's why I love the LSB.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.060]   you
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.120]   you
