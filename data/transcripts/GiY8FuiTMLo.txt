[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   So today I want to talk about an idea from my most recent book, Slow Productivity.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   This is an idea that proved controversial.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   I'm going to argue that a lot of the negative reaction to this idea captures something crucially wrong
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   about the way we think about knowledge work in our current digital moment.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I will then use these insights to offer advice for how we might correct this wrong
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and how you might yourself find a little less burnout in your own professional existence.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   All right, so what is the piece of advice that we're going to base this deep dive on?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I'm going to bring up an article on the screen here for those who are watching.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   This was from my book, Slow Productivity, but I wrote about it in multiple venues
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   after the book came out, including the New York Times.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Here is an article about it that was published at CNBC.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Let me read you the headline of this article.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Want to boost your productivity? Hit the movies during work, expert says.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   A spoiler alert, that expert is me. Let me read the opening to the article here.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Want to get more done? Try stepping back, way back, and maybe out to the movie theater during the workday.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   At least that's one productivity tip from Cal Newport, a Georgetown University professor and author of Slow Productivity.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Okay, so I offered this advice. I lived this advice.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   In fact, and this is true, earlier the week that we are recording this,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I did exactly this advice, more or less. I didn't go to a movie theater, but I did watch a movie during the day.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Here was the setup, just to contextualize this advice.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I had some deadlines I was working on.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Two separate articles that were kind of both trying to get moved on to production,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and I've been working really hard on this during my writing hours.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I write for the first half of most days, and I had to work on Sunday on this,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   because deadlines are coming up. Really worked hard on it.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Monday, really worked hard on it. Tuesday, got everything in Tuesday.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Wednesday morning, did like the final tweaks, and I said to myself, you know what I'm going to do?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I'm not, as my plan for the week says, now move on to returning to my book today and writing.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I'm going to watch a movie instead, and I did.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I got that locked in, and I watched, and I am not embarrassed to admit it,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   because I put this off for a long time.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The 2016, I believe, M. Night Shyamalan movie split.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The second movie in his post-After Earth comeback, a comeback that began with 2015's The Visit.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I was interested. I was on a Shyamalan kick. I forgot why.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I was reading about him for something. I forget why.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And then I went back and was like, what did I miss from Shyamalan during this period in which I was having young kids?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And so I went back and I watched it with James McAvoy, and it was fantastic,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and I really enjoyed it and have a lot of thoughts about it, but it was great.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And then today, so we're recording this on Thursday, back to my book writing.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So I went and watched the movie. I took a break during the middle of the day,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   because I had judged I need to take my foot temporarily off the gas pedal here.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I need to regroup and recharge, and I was able to come back with more energy today.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So that's like what I'm talking about when I say see a movie during the day,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and I really detailed this with more gory details in my book Solar Productivity.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   All right, so there was pushback to this idea.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'm going to paraphrase here a common piece of pushback.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   If you work for a company, you are agreeing to give them eight hours of your labor per day.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   If you step out for two hours, you're essentially stealing.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   All right, so this was sort of the nature of the pushback I was getting on this idea.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I couldn't imagine if one of my employees was gone for two hours,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   they would fire that employee, a lot of that sort of pushback.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I think this is an important pushback, because if we look deeper at what is the source of this objection,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   what we are going to find is two different models for thinking about work.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The first model that's implicitly at play here is what I call cranking.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I'm taking this from the phrase cranking widgets,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and it describes the industrial-era practice of using humans as part of a complex production machinery.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So starting with mills and then with factories as the Industrial Revolution picked up steam,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   you would build these production processes to whatever it is you were doing, milling, cotton, producing cars.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And for the parts of this process that you couldn't really build a mechanical way of doing it,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   you would stick a human in there.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So we have a semi-automated loom, but we still need a human to move whatever the thing is that runs across the loom.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   They have to move that manually.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   There's a lot of parts of building the car that kind of happen automatically,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   but we still need someone to turn the bolt that connects the steering wheel,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   because you kind of have to get in there and do that.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Look, when it comes to cranking, the owners of these factories or mills
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   would prefer to replace the people with machinery if they could.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   They're just using the people where they just don't have machinery to do it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And then over time, as machinery has gotten better, we've needed less and less people in these procedures.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   From the cranking perspective, the critiques of seeing a movie occasionally during the workday makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   When you see employees as crankers, them being there is critical to what you're doing.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   If the guy who attaches the steering wheel to the Model Ts leaves the factory during the day to go watch a Charlie Chaplin movie,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   that's a really big problem, because all the Model Ts are going to come off the line without steering wheels,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and the whole assembly line is going to have to stop while we wait for that guy to get back.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So from a cranking mindset, yes, you can't. Taking breaks during the workday is a problem.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   There's another way to think about work, though, and this has been around for a long time as well,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and it's what I call creating. So we're going from cranking to creating.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Creating means that you are autonomously applying skill and decision-making over time to create something valuable.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There's even a more formal definition that says, you know, add value to materials.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You take in some material and you do something to it, and in the end you have something more valuable,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   whether it is you're carving something out of wood or producing written information
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   that has become more valuable because you've applied your brain to it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   This could be an individual, not necessarily a solo act.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Creating can also be a group of people working together to create something as well.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So at Ford's factories, you were cranking on assembly lines, but at the Oldsmobile Benz,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   the original Benz car factory, it wasn't a factory.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It was a group of craftsmen that would just sit around and produce a car from scratch,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and they were doing more creating than they were cranking.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So here's a key point. When you're looking at creating, it's not a big deal that you have your foot going off
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and on the gas pedal, right? I know a fine woodworker, for example.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   His name is Gary. I wrote about him in Digital Minimalism.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It takes him a couple weeks to finish a commission. Builds really beautiful stuff out of wood.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   If on Thursday from 10 to 12.30 he watches Split, it doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   What matters is over this multi-week period, he's able to have enough concentrated, skilled work
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   that he produces the table. It doesn't really matter exactly when those hours happen or that they're contiguous.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   It's like, are you producing good tables in a reasonable amount of time?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So for creators, this advice of seeing the movie in the afternoon is not a problem.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   All right. So here's what's happened in our economy writ large.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The Industrial Revolution came along and turned more and more jobs into cranking jobs.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   We had a huge amount of cranking jobs. It used to be you had farmers and artisan crafts people,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   and then the Industrial Revolution came along, and more and more of work was actually cranking.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You were working as a human gear in a complicated production process.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Then the knowledge economy became big in the 20th century, right?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So we coined the term "knowledge work" in the 1950s, and by the time we get to the turn of the millennium,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   this is something like 50% or more of the U.S. economy is coming out of knowledge work.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And in knowledge work, where you have a lot of sort of well-educated white-collar workers,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   more and more of what they're doing is much closer to creating, right?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Whether you're creating computer code or marketing campaigns or lectures for the classroom,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   or diagnoses as a doctor or white paper reports on an industrial sector,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   it is creating more than it is cranking.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   There is no well-defined production process that you're a part of.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So these are the people I'm really writing for in slow productivity,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   is the sort of knowledge workers who are creating.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And this is who I'm offering this advice about seeing the movie as a larger metaphor
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   for being able to titrate up and down the intensity of your work
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and make sure that things are sustainable over time,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   that you're not just going all out all the time every day,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and that for this type of complicated work, you need a little bit more give and pull.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Hey, it's Cal. I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   then you need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I have a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I know you're going to like it. Check it out. Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So once we understand these two groups and who I'm writing for,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   now we can see the problem that's facing our knowledge economy today.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   The people who are complaining about my advice are a symptom of this underlying problem
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   that in the knowledge economy, we're treating creators as crankers.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And I get into this in my book, Slow Productivity, how did this come to happen?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's because it's hard to manage people in knowledge work.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Pre-industrial creating was autonomous. It was you're an individual.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   You know, Shakespeare's dad made gloves. It was just him, right?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And he had a shop above. They lived above a shop, and he made gloves.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Knowledge work now, you have a thousand people working in the same office,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and we have managers above them,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and then we have to connect what they're doing to initiatives and resources.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And so we have to manage a bunch of creators now, and it was complicated to do.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's much easier to manage cranking, so we decided we would treat creators like crankers.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   This gave rise to what I call in the book pseudo productivity,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   which is the idea of using visible activity as your proxy for useful effort.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   From this mindset, to see someone not giving effort or to take a break from giving effort is a problem.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's the steering wheel guy going out to see the Charlie Chaplin movie.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   This is a problem, however, at a larger scale because it's a mismatch.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   We are managing creators as if they're crankers.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   This makes the managers' jobs easier, but it makes the creators miserable.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Creating is best served by a mixture of autonomy with accountability.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I know what I'm going to do, see what I did and see if it's good,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   but also leave me alone to get it done.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That's how creating happens best.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And as I get into with example after example and slow productivity,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   one of the things this requires is, again, the careful titration of energy,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   that you're really focused on something and then you have to pull back a little bit to recharge
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   or try to figure out a new angle of attack, and then you put the energy back up again.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   The effort over time is a sort of jagged, unpredictable graph.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's not just a clear step function. I'm working, it's up, I'm done working, and it's down.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   When we treat people who are trying to do this creating as crankers,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I want to see you work at all times.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   In fact, I'm going to throw a lot more kind of cranky, friendly stuff at you
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   while you're trying to create emails to answers and meetings to attend.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's exhausting.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   You're taking something that is supposed to be more up and down and variable
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   and say just work all out all the time, and it exhausts people and it burns people out.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So what I'm arguing here is that we need more clarity in the knowledge economy.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   When you're dealing with creators,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   that is people that you want to apply skill to create valuable things,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   treat them like creators.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Give them autonomy, give them freedom.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Do this without excessive surveillance or interruption.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And on the other end, hold them accountable.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So we're going to let you go and build the stuff we want you to build us.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Now, if the stuff is not good, then we have a problem.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   If you can't show me the value you're creating,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   then I might have to show you to a different role or to a different job.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   But I'm not going to look over your shoulder like the supervisor at the Ford plant.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I'm not going to get upset if I can't see visible activity at all times.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I'm not going to demand that you do a hundred other things as well.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   When you have a pseudo productivity mindset,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I don't care if I'm bombarding you with emails and meetings.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You're going to be here for eight hours doing effort,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   you know, putting those proverbial steering wheels on at a really fast pace.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So who cares how much stuff I throw at you?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   You're going to be here doing stuff anyways.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   But when I have a creator mindset, it's like, no, no, that's getting in the way.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Don't go bother Gary the woodworker with a bunch of administrative questions.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   He's trying to build a table.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So that's what I think we need to do.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And if you want people to be crankers, be clear that's what you want them to do.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And don't expect them to also be creators.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Make it clear this is what the role is.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Give them the right support for it.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Let's put the right controls around it.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   But when we kind of mix these two things together,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   we take largely creator jobs, but we manage them as if they're cranking jobs.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That is one of the key sources of exhaustion and burnout and frustration
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   that we see in the modern knowledge economy.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   So in the reactions to the simple piece of advice,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   every once in a while I'll go see a movie during the day.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   In the reactions to that simple piece of advice,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   we see a complicated problem.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And it's a problem that we can only solve by being clear about what it is
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   we're actually trying to do and evolve the way we actually manage people
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   to reflect what's actually going to work.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   There we go, Jesse.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   You got to see a movie.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You see "Split"?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   No, I haven't.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So Shyamalan was put in movie jail
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   because he had two flops in a row.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And to get out of movie jail--
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So he did "The Last Airbender" and "After Earth,"
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Will Smith's sort of ill-conceived "Avatar" competitor.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   To get out of movie jail, he borrowed $5 million--
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Really?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   --by mortgaging his house and said,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   "I'm just going to do this low-budget comedy thriller.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I'm going to film it myself."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   He filmed it himself, his own $5 million,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and then went to find someone to distribute it.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And no one--they're like, "No, you're in movie jail."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   No one's going to distribute this thing.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   But then finally, Jason Blum from Blumhouse saw it
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and was like--they did "Paranormal Activity."
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They're the kings of a $5 million movie
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   that makes $100 million is a very profitable thing.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And they're like, "All right, we'll distribute it."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And it was very successful. It made like $100 million,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   but they spent nothing on it, so that was like all profit.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And then the second movie of his comeback was "Split."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Okay.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Which it's--but also $9 million.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   He filmed it on the cheap, made like $257 million.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   It's a cool movie.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I don't want to say too much about it.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I really like it.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   There's a third movie now I have to see.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So if you've seen that movie, you know what I'm talking about,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   but I'm not going to spoil it for people.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   But the point is, it was really fun--just to be able to spend
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   a couple hours, like, reading reviews of this
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and watching this movie in the middle of the morning
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   on a Wednesday made such a huge psychological difference for me.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Oh, so you read a lot of the reviews, too.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I read a lot about the movies I watch.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Sometimes I watch and read about it.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Sometimes I read--like, I'll take breaks and read
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and then keep watching some more.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Yeah, I love doing that simultaneously.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Interesting.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I thought about some of them.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Anyways, we've got some good questions to get to,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   but first, let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I want to talk first about--
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   man, it's one of my favorite sponsors--
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Cozy Earth.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You've heard me talk about them on the show before.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   My wife and I are crazy about Cozy Earth.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Cozy Earth is all about helping you turn your home
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   into a personal sanctuary, a place where you can escape
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   the hustle and bustle of daily life.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   They understand the importance of finding comfort and peace
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   amidst the chaos.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Your time outside of work should all be relaxing, recharging,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   and soaking in a sense of calm.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Cozy Earth helps you do this because the fabric they use
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   in their products, their sheets, their PJs, and their towels
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   is just the softest, nicest, most comfortable fabric
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I have encountered.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So I've gone down the list before of our Cozy Earth collection.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   We now have three pairs of Cozy Earth sheets
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to make sure that we always have a pair of Cozy Earth sheets
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   on our bed, even if the other pairs are in the wash.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   So that's something we did.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I have a Cozy Earth sweatshirt, which is very comfortable
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and stays cool because of the viscose bamboo fabric they use.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I really like those.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   My wife has the various Cozy Earth PJs.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   We have Cozy Earth towels.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We just got the Cozy Earth duvet cover,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   so our duvet has that same fabric.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Anyways, I just find their fabric to be very, very comfortable,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and so we swear by it.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It feels good. It's sustainable.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   It's breathable. It's really good about not getting hot.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   It's just the most comfortable fabric stuff that we own.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I think we're running out of things we don't own.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I think I don't have the pajama pants yet,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   so I'm going to get those.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So I am a big Cozy Earth supporter.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   The good news is we have a big discount to offer you,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   which you should definitely use if you're going to order Cozy Earth.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Wrap yourself in luxury this fall with Cozy Earth
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and go to cozyearth.com/deep
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   and use that code "DEEP" for an exclusive discount of up to 40% off.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   If you get a post-purchase survey,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   say you heard about Cozy Earth from the Deep Questions podcast,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   so they know you came from us.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   So cozyearth.com/deep.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Use the code "DEEP" and mention us if you get to the podcast.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   All right, let me talk about comfortable things you can wear.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I also want to talk about our friends at Roan,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and in particular, their new commuter collection,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   the most comfortable, breathable, and flexible set of products known to man.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   This collection has pants, it has dress shirts, it has quarter zips,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   it has polos, right?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   It's like everything you might need to wear
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   for semi-formal, business casual, or casual wear.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Four-way stretch fabric is very breathable and flexible.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   This is important for me.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I get hot, especially if I'm giving a lecture,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   or I'm teaching all day, or I'm running from panel to panel.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This stuff is lightweight, and it breathes.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   It also has wrinkle-release technology.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You travel with this stuff, just put that shirt on in the morning,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   it's going to look fine when you go to do your meeting, or what have you,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   or when you go out that night.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It even has GoldFusion anti-odor technology, so it's great.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It looks great, it's flexible, it's breathable, the wrinkles go through.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It just makes looking good easy, whatever it is that you're up to.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   The commuter collection can get you through any workday
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   and straight into whatever comes next.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Head to rhone.com/cal and use the promo code CAL
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   to save 20% off your entire order.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That's 20% off your entire order when you head to rhone.com/cal
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   and use that code CAL.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   First question is from Adam.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   "I work as the head of AI in a chaotic startup.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   "I've had to be on top of at least 15 simultaneous projects.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "There's always last-minute requests.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   "Do you think there's hope for me being able to carve out time
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "for deep work to contribute technically to these projects?"
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Well, look, we've got to face the productivity dragon here.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Fifteen simultaneous projects are going to create 15 times
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   whatever amount of work managing one product will require.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   So this is going to be the meetings to check-ins
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and some level of interruptions.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You multiply that by 15, it's probably every minute of your day.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   All right?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   You can make this more sustainable, right?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So if you're managing a bunch of things,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   you can make it more sustainable.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And my best advice for that would come from my book
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   "A World Without Email."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   This book really gets into how collaboration should happen
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   in a way that is more friendly for your brain.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And that book would say, "Look, if you have all these things going on,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   "you really have to start seeing unscheduled messages
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   "that require responses.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   "You have to start seeing that as a productivity poison to kill.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   "That's what's getting you having to just jump back and forth
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   "and context shift all day."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So you can manage these projects better by having structured ways
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   that you communicate with people, that you see the status of things,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   that you hold on to things until you have time to talk about it,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   more real-time conversation, less asynchronous back and forth.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   You can make this work more palatable,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   but it's still going to take up all your time.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   So if you want to do deep work,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   which we'll think of that as more of a creating activity
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   where managing these products is more of a cranking activity,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   that's a separate role.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And if you want that role, you have to be explicit about it
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and you have to essentially get hired into that new role.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   So either if you want to be doing deep work,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   you either say, "I don't want to be a manager,"
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   or you say, "I have this second role I want to take on.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   "I want to be hired into this second role
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "of technically contributing to these two projects.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   "And here's how much time this requires
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   "and here's what I'm going to do it, and that time is now protected
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   "and we've figured out how the other stuff should work."
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   But if you're just thinking, "I have all this stuff going on
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   "and I'm just hoping on my own to now fit deep work into there,"
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   you're not facing the dragon.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   You have 15 projects worth of management to do. There's no time.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So make that work less onerous
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   by getting rid of all the unscheduled interruptions,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   but it doesn't make the work go away.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   If you want to do deep work, you've got to see,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   "How many hours do I have?" You have to treat it like a second job.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You have to say, "When am I going to do that second job?"
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   You have to have a schedule that protects it.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You've got to get permission from this, from the people who are above.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Don't take it lightly and don't think
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   that it's something you can just casually do.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   This sort of goes back a little bit to what I was talking about in the deep dive,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   which is we sort of mix together cranking and creating,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and these are two separate things, and we can't just casually do both,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   and we can't just casually think of ourselves as both.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   What we do to optimize one is different
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   than what we would do to do the other thing well.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Managing 15 projects well is a very different state to be in
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   than making really good technical contributions to one thing.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   All right? So let's keep those separations clear.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Let's keep the work sustainable,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and then ask the question of, "Do I want to try to add in a second role
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and not take lightly what that would actually require?"
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I think we talked about this in old episodes, Jesse.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   This might have even been before your time.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I used to talk about if you have a real split role,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   like professors have this.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   You have all these service administrative roles,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   and you've got this really clear, deep role of producing research.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You treat them like two different part-time jobs
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that have different scheduled hours,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and you have different productivity systems for each,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   and you don't mix them at all.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's like, "This is when I'm working at the GAP,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and this is when I'm working at the banana stand,"
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   and they're in two different places, and they're two different jobs,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and I don't do both at the same time,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and I wear a different uniform here than I do over there, right?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And so we had this whole philosophy I talked about in the early episodes
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   about if you have two jobs, treat them like two jobs,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   different systems, different times.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   When you're working on one, you're only working on one.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   When you're working on another, you're only working on another.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   What I fear for this question here, for Adam here,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   is he's at the GAP so long, there's no time for the banana stand,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   but he's still kind of deluding himself into thinking that there is.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Next question is from Axel.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   "I'm not a believer of zero inbox.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   I'd rather handle it as an unprocessed task list.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   However, the number of unwanted messages that come in is overwhelming.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I currently have 20,000 unread emails and counting,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and I'm beginning to miss some important emails.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Can I use my inbox as a task list?"
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   I mean, Axel, when you say, like, "I'm not a believer of, you know,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   cleaning out my inbox," it's like saying,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   "I'm not a believer that humans can't fly,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   so I'm going to go jump off this cliff."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   It doesn't matter what you believe or not, the truth is the truth.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And the truth in this case is your inbox is a terrible task list,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   and you can't use it as your task list.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   You see why. You have 20,000 unread emails.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That's a terrible task list. That's not working.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   You're going to have to process things out of your email.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   If you have any sort of non-trivial type modern digital era knowledge work job,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   your email has to be seen like your physical mailbox would have been seen 25 years ago.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   You wouldn't use your physical mailbox at your office 25 years ago
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   as how you keep track of things, just letting stuff pile up in there.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And just a few times a day, you go to the mail room
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and start just looking through all the stuff in your mailbox and like,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   "Oh, there's a memo. I'm pulling something out. I'm working on that."
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Your inbox is the same way. I know there's more stuff that comes faster,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   so it's more of a pain to keep on top of, but you absolutely have to.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   What I suggest doing is role-based status list.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So you have a different board or list for every role you have in your work.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Each of these boards or lists are divided into different statuses,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   stuff I don't know what to do with, I need to clarify,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   stuff that's on the back burner that I've committed to but don't have a timeline,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   stuff I'm working on this week,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   stuff to discuss at our weekly meeting with this person,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   stuff I'm waiting to hear back from someone about and what I should do once I hear back.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You got to have these statuses.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Everything that comes in your inbox has to move on to one of these lists.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   You can copy text out of your inbox and paste it if you're using a digital tool
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   like Trello or a Google document.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   You can carve this into clay with a chisel.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I don't care about what tools you're using,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   but the information has to get associated with a role,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and within that role, it needs a particular status.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And once you process something, you erase it from your inbox,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and that is a perfect indicator.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   If it's in your inbox, that means you haven't got to it yet,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and when you get to it, that's how you're processing it.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's a pain, but it's the job.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's what you have to do.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   You are having a firehose of information coming at you.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   It doesn't go away if you organize it poorly.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   It's not easier to execute if you ignore it.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Your day does not become less stressful
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   if you pretend like those 20,000 things don't exist.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   You got to process the information so you know what to do with it.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   So something like a role-based status list is the thing to do.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Now this means your email checking becomes more consolidated
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   because you're processing stuff,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so you can spend an hour here and an hour there.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It's not like a background activity.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   If you're going to start doing this,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   it's also going to push you to move more interaction out of your inbox
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   because you're like, "No, no, no, no.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I don't want to be in my inbox so much anymore.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I'm trying to keep it empty," and that's good
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   because that will give you pressure to have better collaboration strategies
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   that aren't happening with back-and-forth unscheduled messages.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I've written whole books about it, but you can't use your inbox.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Here's the summary.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   You can't use your inbox as a to-do list.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   It's not a good to-do list.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   All right, who have we got?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Next question is from Mandy.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   "How do you look at travel within your plans for a deep life?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   We have found travel to be some of our most memorable experiences
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   but also quite disruptive and expensive,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   plus a whole new ballgame now that we have a toddler.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   We sometimes have trouble determining when we should go somewhere and where,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and there seems to be so many factors to weigh."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Mandy, I think this really gets into our deep life discussion
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and in particular the difference between working backwards from a lifestyle vision
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and working forwards towards a goal.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I'm a big advocate of you have this clear vision for your lifestyle.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   What's important to us?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   What do we want our life to be like now and in five years from now
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and in 10 years from now?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And then you work backwards from that vision saying,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   "Given our circumstances and opportunities and obstacles right now,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   how do we move closer to this vision?"
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   This allows for sort of flexible, interesting thinking
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   that reacts to the realities of your situation on the ground.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So you like travel, but that means there's elements of that
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   that are probably part of your lifestyle vision.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   We like to go to interesting places or be exposed to interesting people
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   or experience awe in nature.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   The specific things you're getting out of travel can show up in that vision.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   How you get there just depends on what's going on.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   You have a toddler right now.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So when you're figuring out how do we get closer to this lifestyle vision
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   in the next few years, it's not going to involve
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   we need to go to the Himalayas and spend three weeks
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   because that doesn't make sense with a little kid.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   That's not going to go well.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So what I think might be happening here is instead of working backwards
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   from your lifestyle vision, you're working forwards
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   by committing to a more specific goal or activity
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   that vaguely seems positive to you.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So like, "We like travel. We should travel a lot."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   That's working forward to a goal,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   hoping doing this thing will make our life better,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   as opposed to working backwards from where you're trying to get.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   And when it's, you know, if it's awe in nature or something,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   and before you had your kid, you were getting that by traveling
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   to distance exotic locations.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Well, when you have your kid, you're like, "Okay, well, that's not
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   a reasonable thing to do right now until they get a little bit older,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   but how can we get on nature right now with a toddler?"
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Well, it's going to be more local.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Actually, what we're going to do is you start to get creative.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Now, we live in D.C., but we're going to rent for this year
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   this cabin up in like the Canaan Valley in West Virginia.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's like an hour and a half away or two hours away or something.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   We're going to start going there on the weekends.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   We have a kid yet that doesn't have activities, and we're bored.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   We're stuck at home with the kid.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So what if we had this cabin that we kind of rent?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   We're not going to buy it. We're just going to rent it.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It's like a seasonal rental. We're going to keep going up there.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   We have an Airbnb we do a lot.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   We're going to go up like twice a month and just really get to know
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   this one beautiful area, and the Canaan Valley is a very beautiful area.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Just don't go in the winter because it's, you know,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   roughly 10 times colder than Antarctica.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   But it's otherwise like a really nice area, and think about it.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You're like we're up there. We're getting to know it.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   There's these paths we do with the pack, and like you're obtaining
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   the thing that's important to you, but in a way that makes sense
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   for your current life because what's important was that thing
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   that was important to you, not the particular idea you had in mind
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   for how to do it, which was, you know, maybe we travel, we fly to,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   you know, we go down to Patagonia and do stuff like that.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   So, OK, let's say the thing you like.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I'm just running through some experiments here.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Let's say the thing you liked about travel,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   the actual lifestyle component you liked was going to interesting places
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   and meeting interesting people.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   You have a toddler at home now.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   OK, so how do we prioritize that?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Well, maybe we live near this city.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   So let's really get to know these different neighborhoods in the city
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   or the restaurants over here or what's going on with--
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   There's this kids' theater down at the Kennedy Center now,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and we're going to get a subscription there and go there every summer.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   We're going to go there every weekend and, like, see these shows,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   and you can find ways to satisfy that vision
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   given your current constraints, opportunities, and obstacles.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   That's lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   So this type of thing happens all the time
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   where when we work forward instead of backwards, we get stuck.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   We get stuck on, like, this particular thing is important
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   even if it doesn't work anymore, and it's causing more trouble than harm.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   We're dragging a toddler on these long flights,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and it's costing us a lot of money, and it's disrupting to our schedules,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   and we end up unhappy about it.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   That's what happens when you focus on, like,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   this activity or goal is going to save me
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   as opposed to this is what being safe looks like.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   What's our best way to get there right now?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   That's at the essence of lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I would also say if you're frustrated about, you know,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   there's certain things that you would--
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   visions you'd like to get to that you can't get to right now with a toddler,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   this is a great time to do really forward thinking, right?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Now you start thinking, like, you know what, we're really missing--
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   maybe you really miss being overseas in certain places,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   or, like, you're in love with Scandinavia.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   You're like, "Yeah, it's hard with a toddler," or something like that.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Now you can start thinking, "Hey, this is being clarified for us.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   This piece of our vision is being clarified.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   How could we get to a life 5 years from now, 10 years from now,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   maybe, like, when our kid is in middle school
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   or, like, even thinking to, like, when our kid goes to college
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   where this is a much bigger part of our life
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   because it's being clarified to us that this is important right now?"
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And now you start to think more creatively.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Well, you know, if you moved over to consulting
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and I was able to make this fully remote--
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I can't do that now, but let's think about how that could work.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   There might be a situation here where we could spend 4 months out of the year,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   you know, living on this glacier.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Like, it could open up some really interesting long-term thinking as well.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So all this comes down to make your lifestyle vision clear,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   work backwards flexibly and creatively towards,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   "How do I get closer to this given what I have available to me right now?"
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And it's going to open up lots of cool options.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   "How can I find the most interestingness and happiness
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and subjective well-being right now?"
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   It'll also clarify some of, like, more radical longer-term things you might do as well.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   So it's an opportunity, Mandy. This is not, I would say, a problem.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   All right, moving right along.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Next up is Lisa.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   "How can I communicate that I've heard enough of my partner's work issues
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   without sounding like a jerk?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I feel like I'm an unpaid staff that is always available for event session."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I would say probably like a taser.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You know what I'm saying? It's like if it gets past a certain threshold,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   just right down it goes. Boom.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I think it's like a Pavlovian thing there.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So, like, over time, then he'll sort of pull it back.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So, Lisa, actually, I think what's interesting here
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   is probably what's going on with your partner.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   If he or she is venting a lot,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   so clearly they must be venting a lot.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Everyone vents a little bit, like, "Oh, man, so-and-so was a pain at work today."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   But if they're venting to the place where, like,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   you're thinking about my taser solution,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   their relationship to their job's no good.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Like, you need to get them listening to my podcast.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   In particular, here's what I would worry that's going on.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   When I hear someone who's an over-venter,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   like, all they can think about is the negatives of their job,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and you're talking about it all the time,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   it typically means, like, they're feeling as if
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   they have a lack of autonomy or efficacy.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I don't really have control over what I do.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I don't feel like I'm able to do anything of any real value.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   You know, I'm a widget cranker, and it feels nihilistic.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I'm the Ron Livingston character in office space.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And in that situation, where you have no autonomy or efficacy,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   everything is a problem.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And so you just see everything going on around you
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   as a problem that is frustrating.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   This is corrosive over time.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's sort of corrosive to your soul.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   So how do you get out of this trap
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   of feeling like you don't have autonomy or efficacy?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   You follow the advice from my book,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You build career capital.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   You invest career capital to move your work
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   towards things that resonate and away from things that don't.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   The process alone of acquiring career capital,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   which means getting good at things
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   that are unambiguously rare and valuable in your field,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   that process alone of seeking mastery,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   already you're going to feel like you have autonomy.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Like, "I'm getting better. I have a plan."
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And then when you begin investing this career capital,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   which means just using your skills as leverage
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   to kind of control what your work and existence is like,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   things get even better.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   You push it towards the stuff you like
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and away from the other stuff.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And it's not that so much
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   that there's some magical configuration for your job
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   that is going to make everything better.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   It's the fact that you have control over your job
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   that's going to make things feel better.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's that autonomy, that efficacy.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   "I'm getting better. People think I'm good.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   "I'm using this to change how I do it.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   "I'm respected for what I'm doing.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   "I'm recognized for what I'm doing.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "I use this as leverage to change the structure of my job,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   "so I don't do this and I do this,"
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   or whatever it is that you do.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   That's the sweet spot where it's not that the things
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   seem so much as a threat.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   They're a nuisance. They're amusing.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   They're like, "Yeah, so-and-so's crazy. Who cares?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   "Yeah, the management is, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   "Doesn't matter. I'm getting after it.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   "As I get this skill, I'm about to go full remote.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   "We're going to move to that whatever,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   "that glacier in Finland."
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Like, there's an excitement to it.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So that's what I would say is really going on here.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   If they're venting all the time,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   they got to change their relationship to their work.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And so, "Okay, get them listening to my podcast.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   "Get them a copy, if so good, they can't ignore you."
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Maybe what you should do for the near future
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   is every time they vent past a certain threshold,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   just smack them with, "So good, they can't ignore you,"
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   and eventually there'll be like an osmosis thing
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   where some of those ideas will just begin to seep through.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But work, it shouldn't be a source of constant venting,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   and that typically is less about who you're working with,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   what you're doing, and more about
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   your relationship to your job.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   All right, what do we got next, Jesse?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   - We have our corner.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   - Woo, Slow Productivity Corner, let's hear that theme music.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   (slow guitar music)
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   For those who are new, we have one question every week
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   that specifically relates to my most recent book,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "Slow Productivity," we call it the Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   If you have not bought and read "Slow Productivity" yet,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   you need to, it's like the Bible for, I would guess,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   50% of what we talk about on this show.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   All right, Jesse, what's our Slow Productivity Corner
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   question of the week?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Question's from Dan, "I've owned an e-commerce business
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   "for 23 years and spend nearly all my time on the computer.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   "How can I adhere to the slow productivity principles
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   "with health issues that constantly interfere?"
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   - Well, Dan, I would add an extra word to there,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   and I would say, you know, how could I possibly
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   not adhere to the slow productivity principles
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   with health issues that constantly interfere?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   In other words, you're exactly in a situation, probably,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   where you need slow productivity.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Because what is the opposite of slow productivity?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   If you don't have slow productivity,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   what are you probably facing? Pseudoproductivity.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   As we talked about in the deep dive of this episode,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   what is pseudoproductivity?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   It's the equation of visible effort for usefulness.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   So in a pseudoproductivity regime, you have to just be
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   rock and rolling, visibly and busily,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   all day long, every day, up to here.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Like, you gotta have the thing pegged to 10 all the time,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   or you're seen as being unuseful or unproductive.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   That is a really hard state if you, for example,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   have health issues that means,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "I can't have 100% energy all the time."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   You know, sometimes I can, sometimes I can't.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Maybe I have appointments I have to go to,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Pseudoproductivity is a disaster for anyone
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   who doesn't have the privilege of being in a situation
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   where you can just sort of crank it at 10 all day long.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Why not?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Pseudoproductivity is a game for, you know,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   24-year-olds without families and plenty of energy
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   who can just like exist off of Red Bull.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Slow productivity could be your savior here.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Slow productivity says what matters is what you produce,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   not how you do it.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It's about sustainability.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It's about keeping your workload reasonable,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   being able to have some balance back and forth
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   in your energy depending on what's demanded of the moment.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And then over time, saying,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "Judge the quality of what I do, not the quantity."
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   That in particular is good if you have sort of
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   a non-traditional energy reserves or time availability.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Because it means as you get better,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   as you get better, as your quality goes up,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   you get more and more flexibility, right?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   One way to think about this is if you can barely
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   make things work in your current situation
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   at your current level of skill, like,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   "Okay, I have the amount of money I make for this,"
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   or whatever, like, "It works, but it's very hard
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   for me to produce this much stuff."
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   You know, if you get twice as good,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   one of the options you have is to essentially, like,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   have the time you have to spend while keeping yourself
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   in the same job position or earning situation, right?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And that might be much better, right?
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   In other words, quality is one of the things
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   you can trade quality for is much less actual
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   total hours needed to work.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And for people who are in situations
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   where they have huge time demands or health issues,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   having greatly reduced hours
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   compared to someone else is important.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And how do you do that without getting, like,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   part-time pay?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   You get really, really good,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   and instead of cashing in that skill to get more money,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   you cash in to get more flexibility.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   That's a key slow productivity principle.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   So I think slow productivity, you know,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   it's one of the advantages of this idea
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   is that we can't all succeed
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   in the pseudo-productivity regime.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   We can't all just show up in the parking lot early,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   leave later, answer to every email chain
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   as quickly as possible,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   always be there for the meeting in person.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Not all of us can have that option
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   as a means of sort of, like,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   getting ahead in the workplace.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Slow productivity opens this up
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   for so many more people,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and it makes work sustainable.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   It makes work not a drag on your emotional life.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It makes work not a drag on your
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   sort of, like, physical well-being.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   So, you know, Dan,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I'm glad you found slow productivity.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   I think embracing those ideas
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   might really be a positive thing for you.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   So I don't know if I explicitly made
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   the connection between slow productivity
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   and sort of accessibility more generally
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   in the book, but I should have,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   because in the eight months
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   since that book has come out,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   this connection has been made to me quite a bit.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   All right, do we have a call this week, Jesse?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   - We do. - Ooh, let's hear it.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   - Okay.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   - Hi, this is Sarah. I'm a psychologist.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   I'm very eager to apply the principles
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   of deep work to my life.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   The strategies offered and the how-tos
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   have been very helpful.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   However, I'm struggling with making a decision
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   about what to choose.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   I'm in my 30s, and I work part-time.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I've always had an inclination towards the arts,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   and now that I have the time,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I would like to invest in it as a serious hobby
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   and potentially turning it into
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   a more serious endeavor.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I'm torn between music and visual arts,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   particularly photography.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   I took lessons in playing classical music
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   for a few years before I stopped practicing
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   due to the demands of graduate school.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   While I have more passion for music,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I feel hopeless about becoming
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   impressively good at it given my age,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   but I see more opportunities
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   in engaging with visual arts.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Right now, I'm doing both,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   but my time is fragmented.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   I want to immerse myself in one
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   and get really good at it.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   I would appreciate your guidance on this.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   All right, that's a good question.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Let's generalize this question to be,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   "How can I—" not later in life,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   but I'm in my 30s, right?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I'm not just getting started.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   "How can I transform an interesting side hobby
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   into a bigger part of my life?"
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   In this case, a creative pursuit.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   I've got three things I want to suggest here
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   that I think are going to be useful.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   One, I would—
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and I think you're picking this up in your question—
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   avoid things that are notably winner-take-all
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   in terms of their dynamics.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Professional music, let's say classical music,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   that's very winner-take-all in their dynamics
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   in the sense that there are formal positions
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and orchestras that you can play these instruments.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It is incredibly competitive,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   and the best players get to do it.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Sports are very winner-take-all as well.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   You want to be an athlete, it's like,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   "Here are the teams. There's a ton of people
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   who want these spots. The very best people
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   want these spots."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   That's for obvious reasons.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   These are difficult targets to go towards
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   a little later in life.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   It's hard starting in your 30s to become
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   one of the best French horn players in your city.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   It's hard in your 30s to become
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   one of the best baseball players in the state.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   So you want to avoid, when you're coming
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   to this a little later and transforming
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   something on the side to something bigger,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   be worried about significant winner-take-all dynamics.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   It's like businesses, small businesses,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   don't have this.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   There's room for lots of different businesses
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   to do lots of different things.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Visual arts, I think you're picking up on this right.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   There's room in there for you to have
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   an interesting visual art career because
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   you are doing something unique.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   That there's a big enough population who likes,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   you can make an interesting living doing that.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   It's not winner-take-all.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Two, really lean into deliberate practice.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Your time is limited, both in terms of
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   how much you have available to work
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   on the side pursuit because you have
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   other things going on and in how much time
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   you have to get good because you're not 16 anymore.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Deliberate practice is the most efficient
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   way to get better at things.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   It means the time you spend trying to get better
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   at something should be working on
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   carefully designed activities that are
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   designed to stretch you to get better
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   at something that's critical in your field.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   It's like if you want to become a visual artist,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   don't just take a lot of photos.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   If you want to become a writer,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   don't just write your pages every day.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   You've got to find a way now to get training.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I want every minute that I'm working on this
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   right now to be stretching me to get better.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Doing something I don't do well with guidance
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   on how to do it better and then getting
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   harsh feedback on whether or not I actually got there.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You've got to join things, work with people,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   get in the writers' groups, take classes,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   difficult classes like in photography,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   try to get exhibited in amateur minor things.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   You need the pressure, you need the training,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   you need the stretch. You don't want to waste the time.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   You want the time you're spending to be really high quality.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And the final piece of advice I'd offer here,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   and this also comes from my book,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   use money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   So in particular, when you're deciding like,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   should I make this side hobby into my full-time job,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   don't just guess I'm ready to do it.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Don't just say, predict, I bet this would,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I bet I could pull this off.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Actually get people to give you money.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   And the reason why we use that term
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   neutral indicator of value is that it means
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   nothing for people to give you praise.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   People are happy to praise you.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   They're happy to say, this is great.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   You should do this. You should open a gallery.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   But people hate to give away their money
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   unless they're really getting value for it.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   So if people are buying your photos,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   it's an indication they're good.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   If people are telling you, we love your photos,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   it means nothing.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   If people are buying your albums,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   your music is good.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   If they're not, it's not ready yet
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   for you to do full-time.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   If you can sell your articles,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   if you've got a book deal for your book,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   then you're on to something with your writing.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   If you haven't, you haven't.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   So let money be the neutral judge finally
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   that tells you, okay, this stuff
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   is at a good enough level.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   In my book, this phrase comes from Derek Sivers,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   who talked about using this when he quit his job
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   to become a full-time musician.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   He waited until he was making roughly his salary
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   as a musician on the side to quit his job.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And then when he started his company, CD Baby,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   he didn't go full-time to doing that company
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   until the money it was making
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   was more or less what he was making from his music.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And he's like, great, now I can move over to that.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   And he introduced this phrase.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   He's like, I use money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   That's how I knew something was good enough
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   for me to now trust this to be my full-time thing.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So avoid things with significant winner-take-all dynamics.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   You want to find things where there's lots of little niches
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   in which you could find an interesting home.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Deliberate practice as much as possible.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   The time you have to spend on the side thing,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   make that time useful.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   And three, if you're going to make something side
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   into your full-time thing, make sure you're using money
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   as your neutral indicator of value.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Everyone will tell you that your kid really looks good,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   but if they don't hire them for the modeling contract,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   don't take them out of school.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   So same thing sort of here.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Money, people don't lie with that.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   You know, Jesse, people often misunderstand Derek's quote.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   And so they think when he says money is a neutral indicator
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   of value, that it means the amount of money you have
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   tells people how valuable you are as like a person
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   or something, which is like the opposite.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Derek gave away all the money he made
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   when he sold the CD Baby.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   He just went, no, no, it's a neutral indicator
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   of the value of what you're doing,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   so you know whether or not it's working or not.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   - Right.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   - Yeah.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   All right, we got a case study here.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   This is where people send in their own experiences
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   putting the type of advice we talk about on the show
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   in the practice in their own life.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   If you have a case study, you can send it
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Today's case study is from Filippa, who writes,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   "I was a lawyer for 20 years, but never really enjoyed it
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   "for the obvious reasons.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   "I'm also a single mother of three teens.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   "Nevertheless, I put in the hours,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   "and I was eventually promoted to equity partnership.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   "I was actually able to change some of the culture
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   "over a five-year period.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   "I bought lots of copies of Deep Work."
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Oh, "I actually bought lots of copies of Deep Work.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   "The next step was to apply to become CEO
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   "so that I could continue educating my firm
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   "about the benefits of your messages.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   "I talked about that stuff in my interview
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   "while the other candidates focused on profits,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   "bonus systems, and billable hours.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   "I did get the CEO job, however,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   "and I didn't make any sudden moves.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   "A little time passed, and I was offered two consultancy jobs.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   "My law firm allowed me to work there one day per week.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   "As per your advice, I wanted to first find out
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   "if there was a desire for my skills outside of law.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   "The other element which was essential to me
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   "being able to take these steps
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   "was having a brilliant financial planner.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   "He was able to help me manage my finances
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   "to ensure that I planned out my savings and expenditures
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   "with a goal in mind.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   "It turned out there was, and 18 months later,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   "I was able to hand in my notice to the law firm
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   "and walk away.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   "I have now been offered the CEO role
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   "of one of the firms starting in 2025.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   "This gave me 12 months to take some time with my daughters
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   "and to work on a book.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   "Over the summer, I took my kids around Europe for a month,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   "something I could never have found the time for
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   "nor the mental energy to do
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   "when I was working all the hours as a lawyer.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   "The firm I will join is a financial advice firm
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   "with a totally different culture.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   "Your sage advice has led me to a place
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   "where I honestly wake up excited for the day."
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   All right, there's some great examples here
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   of various things we've talked about on the show,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   including in today's episode.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   One is lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Working backwards from what do I want my life to be like,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   and then looking for a flexible way forward to get there.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   I can assure you, if we go back 10 years, right,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   and say to Philippa, "What do you want to do?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   "What's your strategy?"
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Where she is now is not something
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   that you would just naturally come up with.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   "Well, what I'm gonna do is be the CEO
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   "of a financial advising firm."
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Like, it's not like an obvious thing to do,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   but working backwards from her lifestyle vision,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   she worked her way through what was available in the moment
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   to get closer and closer,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and these opportunities were excavated as she proceeded.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   It's like people who work backwards
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   from lifestyle visions end up in deep lives
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   in ways they never could have predicted
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   the full path of in advance.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   So I really like to see that example.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   Now, when you do this,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   when you're working backwards from a lifestyle vision,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I said, look, I often talk in generalities.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I said, "Yeah, you gotta work with, like,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   "what are your opportunities and obstacles
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   "that you face right now, and how do you make the most,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   "given that, how do you find flexible ways forward?"
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   or something like that.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   We get some specifics in here of what that might mean.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   It's like, what are a couple things that were tried here?
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Well, one thing she tried was doing this one day a week
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   in a different type of work, right?
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   That is an interesting move when you're trying to explore,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   "I'm trying to get closer to this lifestyle.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   "This type of work might get me there.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   "I don't know how, so let me dedicate one day a week
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   "to this work and see what I learn."
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   I think that's gonna open up options, and it did.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   The other thing I really wanna underscore here
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   is financial planning.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   I've actually added this
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   to the "Deep Life" book I'm working on now.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I talk about lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   working backwards from your lifestyle,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   not forward towards a ground goal,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   and I have this chapter I'm adding where I'm like,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   "Here's three really useful things to keep in mind
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   "when you're coming up with these plans working backwards,"
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   and one of them is financial.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   This can open up so many interesting paths
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   that would otherwise be unavailable.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   When you get careful about your money
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   and transparent about your money,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   "I know how much we make and how much we spend,"
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and you can create a lot of give in there.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   "Hey, I got promoted to equity partner,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   "but we're still living what I was on
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   "as a fourth-year associate," right?
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   We have all this flexibility and give.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Our lifestyle's not too inflated.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   We're careful with our investments.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I can turn the money and expenses up and down.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Being careful with your finances
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   just really expands the options you have
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   when you're trying to explore different ways
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   to get closer to your lifestyle,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   and we see exactly this here.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   It allowed Philippa to take a year off
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   and then to move to this other position.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   I'm sure it's probably not as well-paid
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   as being an equity partner.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   So it's financial planning.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   It's like one of these tools you can use
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   when you're trying to feel your way
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   towards this lifestyle vision you have.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   The more control and flexibility
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   you have in your finances,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   the more paths that are actually open to you.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   So I think there's a lot of cool
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   on-the-ground concrete tactics
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   captured in this one story.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   All right, we got a final segment coming up,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   but before we do,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   I want to talk in particular about our friends
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   at MyBodyTutor.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   I've known Adam Gilbert,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   MyBodyTutor's founder, for many years.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   He used to be the fitness advice expert
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   for my blog in the early days.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Here's the cool thing about his company,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   MyBodyTutor.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   It solves the biggest problems
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   that people face when trying to get healthier,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   which is consistency.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   It's not too hard to figure out
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   what it means to eat healthy.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   It's not too hard to figure out
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   that you should exercise a lot.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   The knowledge is not the problem.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   The problem is actually doing all these things
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   and adapting as needed
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   to the unique problems in your life.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   This is where MyBodyTutor comes in.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   When you sign up, they connect you to a coach.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   And this coach helps you come up with,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   "Hey, here's what we're doing with nutrition.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Here's what we're doing with exercise.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   And then here's the key thing."
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   You check in every day.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   It's not time-consuming.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   They have this, it's an app.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   It's simple.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   You press a few buttons.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Here's what I ate.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Here's what I did for exercise.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   But you have the accountability
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   of checking in with your coach every day.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   And that makes all the difference.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Knowing there's someone who cares about you
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   and your health
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   and is gonna see what you did that day
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   makes you actually consistent.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   It helps you actually act
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   on the things you know you should be doing.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   And because you have this coach,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   they can also help you adapt.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   "Oh my God, I'm traveling for the holidays.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   I'm not gonna have access to my gym.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   I'm worried about the food.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   What should I do?"
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Like they can help you adapt,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   but you get that accountability.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And because the coaches are online,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   you're connected via the internet.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   It's not a physical trainer coming to your house
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   or a nutritionist coming to your house.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's a fraction of the cost
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   of what it would be to actually do this
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   the old-fashioned way with people in your house.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   So if you wanna get healthier,
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   this is how you do it, MyBodyTutor.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   So the good news is,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Adam is giving Deep Questions listeners
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   $50 off their first month.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   All you have to do is mention
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   the Deep Questions podcast when you sign up.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   So go to MyBodyTutor.com.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Sign up and mention that you came
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   from the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   I also wanna talk about
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Blinkist is an app that gives you
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   more than 6,500 book summaries
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   and expert-led audio guides
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   to read and listen to
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   in just 15 minutes per title.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   You can access best-in-class
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   actionable knowledge from 27 categories
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   such as productivity, psychology, and more
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   on the go and get entertained
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   at the same time.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   I think reading is very important.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   I talk about it all the time on this show.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   And as I've mentioned,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Jesse and I use Blinkist
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   as part of our reading ritual.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   What we do is if there's a book
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   that interests us,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   we add that to our Blinkist queue,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   and then we get a chance,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   we listen to the blink or read the blink,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   takes 15 minutes,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   and that's how we figure out,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   ooh, should I buy this book or not?
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   There's other ways you can do this as well.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   The summaries are entertaining on their own.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   It's a quick way to survey a field.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   But I find it to be like a great
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   sort of assistant for helping
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   to triage possible books
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   and figure out what it is you want to read.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   There's a good feature I want to mention right now
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   called Blinkist Connect.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   So right now with Blinkist,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   you can give another person
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   unlimited access for free.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   So you basically get a two for one deal.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   So you don't want to miss that.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   All right, so let's talk deals here.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   just for our audience.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Go to blinkist.com/deep
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   to start your seven-day free trial,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   and you will get 40% off
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Blinkist.com/deep to get 40% off
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   and a seven-day free trial.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   That's blinkist.com/deep.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   And remember, now for a limited time,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   you can even use Blinkist Connect
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   to share your premium account.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   You will get two premium subscriptions
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   for the price of one.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   All right, Jesse,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   let's go to our final segment.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I want to react today in our final segment
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   to an interesting piece of news
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   that someone sent to my
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   interesting@calnewport.com email list.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   I have this article up on the screen
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   for those who are listening instead of--
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   I mean, watching instead of just listening.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   All right, this is from CNBC.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Here is the headline of the article.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Whole Foods CEO swears
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   by one productivity-boosting strategy.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Quote, "I don't get stuck in meeting after meeting."
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   All right, I'm intrigued.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   What is the one productivity-boosting strategy
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   that prevents him from getting stuck
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   in meeting after meeting?
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Let's go down to the article body here.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   All right.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And I'm going to read
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   the first couple of paragraphs.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Whole Foods Market CEO Jason Buchel
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   has one primary tactic
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   that keeps him productive, he says.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Time blocking.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   "It's important that I time block my schedule
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   "so I don't get stuck in meeting after meeting
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   "and I can focus on Whole Foods Market's
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   "longer-term vision and strategy.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   "The time blocking method involves
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   "carving out specific windows of time
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   "for high-priority work tasks.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   "Spending time in physical stores
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   "is a big priority for Buchel, for example,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   "so he reserves time in his calendar each Friday
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   "to visit at least one location."
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   All right, let's stop right there.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   He's using the term time blocking,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   more or less how I use it.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   When I talk about time blocking,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I do mean giving every minute of the day a job
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   so that you're executing a plan for your time
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   as opposed to just deciding as the day goes on,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   what should I work on next?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Where we differ here a little bit
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   is typically when I talk about time blocking,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   I talk about time blocking the current day.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   It's hard to build a detailed time block plan
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   for more than one day at a time.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Now, what the Whole Foods CEO here is talking about
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   is time blocking out in advance.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   So how do we rectify this with my type of advice?
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   I'm not sure if I would use the term time blocking,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   but what he's capturing here is a mixture
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   of weekly planning and autopilot scheduling.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   All right, so in my cosmology of personal productivity,
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   weekly planning is where at the beginning of the week
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   you survey what's on your calendar and say,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   "What is it? What is my week?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   "What are my priorities?
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   "Do I want to shift anything around?
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   "Do I want to cancel anything?"
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   And one of the things you do during your weekly plan
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   is say, "What are my big goals?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   "Do I want to protect some time this week,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   "which I will treat like any other meeting or appointment,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   "to make progress on my big goals?"
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   It makes sense to do that at the beginning of the week.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   So that's time blocking
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   in the sense that you're blocking off time,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   but you're doing it at the beginning of your week.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   So let's say the CEO had some priority of like,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   "I'm really working on understanding
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   "our market demographics.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   "We really have to change things around."
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   He might then, when he's doing his weekly plan,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   find a couple of blocks to block off
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   the focus on like reading through those reports or something.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   The other thing this is relevant to is autopilot scheduling,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   which is actually what I think he's doing
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   in the specific example he gives here.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   That's where you have something you know
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   you need to do on a regular basis,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   so you set it up on your calendar
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   to appear on a regular basis.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   So the CEO of Whole Foods wants to spend Fridays
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   going to a location.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   That's an autopilot schedule right there.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   The Fridays are all blocked off
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   or certain times are blocked off in advance,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   going to locations, right?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   So stuff you know you need to do that's important
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   that happens on a regular schedule,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   just get that on your schedule in advance.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   So if you're doing these things,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   weekly planning and autopilot scheduling,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   now when you get to a particular day
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   and you're time blocking that day,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   there might already be quite a few things on there
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   that have already been placed in advance
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   that are important.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   So you might not actually have that much free time
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   left to block.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   All right, now there's another little tip
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   that's given in here, which I really like.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   This is a in-the-trenches tactical tip around meetings
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   coming from someone who gets a lot of meetings.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   So let me read this for you here,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   'cause I like this idea.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   "Getting calendar bombed by unproductive meetings
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   can derail his day."
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   He recently told LinkedIn's
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   "This Is Working" podcast and video series.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   "Bugle's daily time block schedule, though,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   means he's only going to meetings
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   that I really need to be there for
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   and that are only as long as they need to be.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   On a typical day, Bugle can have 10 meetings or more,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   he tells Makeit.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   The company encourages staff to hold
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   20 and 50-minute meetings
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   to free up 10-minute intervals in between
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   during which they can work on any action items discussed.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   He uses these 10-minute windows
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   for running ad hoc meetings with my direct reports
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   or dealing with a pressing issue that might pop up."
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   This is a fantastic idea.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   Again, it's not time block planning,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   but the post-meeting block
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   is something that I regularly recommend.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   It's something that plays a big role in my book,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   "Slow Productivity."
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   The idea is when you schedule a meeting,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   you have to schedule 10 or 15 minutes
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   immediately following the meeting
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   for processing and taking action
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   on what was just discussed.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Otherwise, if you stack meetings
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   without an air gap on your schedule,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   what's going to happen is
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   you're going to get a bunch of stuff
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   in this meeting that needs to be done,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   you have to think through,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   new obligations are now on your plate,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   and they're going to be right there in your brain
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   as you move right into the next meeting.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Completely different context,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   completely different demands.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   And now you're trying to remember these
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   while new things are coming up.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   And then you go to your next meeting.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   If there's no cognitive air gap,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   then that's going to begin piling up
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   and it's exhausting and it's stressful
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   and you're going to forget things.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   You have 15 minutes or 10 minutes
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   after each meeting, you say, "Great.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   All right, let me figure out what this meant.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   Let me go to my role-based status list
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   and put tasks on here.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Let me update my calendar.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Let me send out the emails that I promised.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Like, okay, I'm going to follow up on this.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   Let me send that email now.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Hey, Jesse, we just had a meeting about it.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   Here's what we discussed.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   We want you to be involved.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Here's the feedback we need.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Let me give you a bit of a process here
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   because I do process-centric emailing.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I created a shared document.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Please put your thoughts in there.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   You can wait till Friday.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   If you have any questions,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   like grab me at my next office hours,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   let me send that off."
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   You're closing all the loops from the meeting.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   So you can go to the meeting with a fresh start.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   And what I like about this particular way
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   that the CEO talked about it
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   is because he's in big meetings with big teams,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   he brings his direct reports with him
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   to the post-meeting block.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   That's pretty clever, right?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Now that I think about this,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I usually do this at my faculty meetings.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   After a big faculty meeting at my department,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   you have a quick impromptu post-meeting
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   with like two people from the department
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   to figure out the thing that involves both of you
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   or all of you, right?
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   So I like this idea
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   that he will bring his direct reports
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   into the after-action meeting
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   and together they make sense of,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   "Okay, what are we doing next, if anything,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   because of this meeting?"
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   All right, so we got a couple of good ideas here.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Plan important stuff on your calendar in advance,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   whether this is in daily time block planning,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   weekly planning, or autopilot scheduling.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   And when you're scheduling meetings,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   add an after-meeting block for you
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   or you and your most closest collaborators
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   to make sense of
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   and close every loop about what you just discussed.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   So there we go.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   Real productivity advice from the wild.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   All right, well,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Thank you, everyone,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   who sent in your questions or calls.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   We'll be back next week.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   So if you like today's discussion
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   about cranking versus creating,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   I think you might also like episode 291,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   which was titled, "Do Better, Do Less."
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Check it out,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   because it highlights a key principle
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   from my book, "Slow Productivity,"
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   about how to move your professional life
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   away from busyness
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   and toward producing results that matter.
