[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   Confidence is a term we're all familiar with,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.280]   but most of us have trouble building it or using it.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.240]   Today, we have Dr. Aziz Gazipura,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.380]   one of the world's leading confidence experts,
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.000]   to talk about how you can cultivate and grow confidence
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   as a way to harness your true potential.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900]   So if you want to learn how to use confidence
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.400]   to become successful and live a happier life,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.240]   you'll definitely want to keep watching.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.720]   And if you want to support the channel,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.760]   please give us a thumbs up and subscribe.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.200]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.860]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.740]   Aziz, thanks for being here.
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.580]   - I'm glad to be here, thank you, Chris.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.680]   - I think most of us know what confidence is
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.860]   or what it feels like,
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.460]   but I think it'd be good to start this conversation off
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.860]   by just having you define it for us.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.240]   - Yeah, my favorite definition is going straight
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.780]   to the root in Latin, which is confides,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.860]   which means with faith,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.700]   which is pretty broad, with faith,
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.220]   but it's like faith in what?
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.780]   Well, you can have self-confidence.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.860]   I believe in myself.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.300]   That would be called,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.860]   they call that self-efficacy in psychology, right?
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.300]   I believe I'm effective.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.500]   I believe I can do that.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.180]   If you've been a mechanic for a bunch of years,
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.040]   you have self-confidence that you can fix a car.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.740]   But then there's also social confidence.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.580]   Are you able to talk to people?
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.860]   Are you able to connect with them?
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.660]   And then we can also have confidence in our careers,
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.300]   in our romantic life, but in any area of your life,
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.740]   do you have faith in yourself?
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.580]   Do you have faith in possibly something beyond you
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.060]   in the future, in what you can create?
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.420]   But that's really at its root, what it is.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.540]   It's really just a belief in you
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.780]   or in something going the way
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.740]   that you think you can create it.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.420]   - What do you think most people are getting wrong
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.780]   when they think about their own confidence?
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.420]   - I think at its root,
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.680]   most people don't think that it's an inside job.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.700]   Their confidence is very contextual.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300]   It's very based upon the circumstances of their life.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.980]   So they make money, the job goes well,
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.700]   the deal goes through, they feel more confident.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.580]   The person likes you.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.740]   You get the positive response on social media
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.380]   or someone's like, "I think your work is great."
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.380]   Or someone wants to go on a date with you.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.780]   And you're like, "Yeah, yeah."
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.260]   And your confidence goes up.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.500]   And then rejection, setback, bad day, challenge,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.620]   confidence goes down.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.500]   And most people are kind of riding that current
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.900]   up and down, up and down.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.920]   And they fail to realize that confidence
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   is actually an inside job.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.980]   And it's not, sure, we're affected by circumstances,
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.960]   but it doesn't have to be a buoy
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.200]   on the surface of the water.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.060]   You can actually choose and practice tools
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.460]   and habits to sustain higher confidence,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220]   more unconditional confidence
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.020]   that doesn't require your circumstances
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.140]   to be in your favor.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.260]   'Cause, I mean, how often are they always in our favor?
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.540]   It's like, we don't have control over that.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.140]   - Yeah, I mean, you've said you can cultivate,
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.700]   nurture, and grow these habits.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.980]   How do we do that?
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.340]   - Ah, well, you gotta first know what the habits are, right?
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.580]   What are the habits of confidence?
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.220]   And there's a handful of them
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.580]   that are gonna be like the 80/20,
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.060]   the ones that get you the biggest bang for your buck.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.980]   And a lot of people might have heard of a few of them,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.800]   but are we practicing them?
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.220]   And do we really know how to do them?
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.180]   And so I'm gonna distill it down just to two,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.920]   'cause 10 is too many, just two.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.660]   You do these, it's gonna change
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.820]   the lion's share of your confidence.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.980]   One is inside of what you do,
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.180]   and one is what you practice in the world.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.760]   So on the inside, I call it being on your own side,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.460]   on my own side.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.180]   And that's a phrase that is basically,
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.540]   how do you treat yourself,
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.860]   and how do you relate to yourself?
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.060]   So we all have a relationship with ourselves,
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.640]   as well as with your family, your friends,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.100]   your spouse, your kids, whatever.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100]   But then there's you and you.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.700]   And you're with you 24/7.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.620]   And if you look inside of most people's heads,
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.460]   if you were to kind of peel it back and observe,
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.500]   most people, even successful people,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.420]   have a negative or toxic relationship with themselves.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.700]   If you were to observe two humans,
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.420]   like at a restaurant talking to each other,
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.500]   the way that you talk to yourself,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.420]   you'd probably be like disturbed.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.060]   You'd be like, do I have to sit here?
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.420]   Can I move tables?
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.900]   Right, it's critical, it's negative,
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.260]   it's predicting the worst, it's harping on things,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.820]   it's nitpicking.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.180]   And this isn't just horribly low confidence people.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.300]   And most people are just kind of trying
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.740]   to push through that and ignore it,
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.340]   but it's like a dead weight on your confidence.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.940]   So you have to change your relationship with yourself,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.020]   and we can talk more about how to do that.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.980]   That's the first habit, to be on your own side,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.620]   to treat yourself like someone you actually love,
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.680]   and to learn how to optimize the way you coach yourself.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.340]   Most people are very bad at that.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.140]   And then the second side is,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.060]   you have to consistently build the muscle of confidence,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.580]   which is a byproduct of bold action.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.020]   So if you take bold action in the world,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.980]   you will, just like if you lift weights
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.420]   and push it to the edge, you will grow muscle.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.980]   And it's the same thing with confidence.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.820]   If you do what scares you,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.340]   then the byproduct of that is confidence.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.660]   And if you combine those two,
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.900]   and you practice those regularly,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.700]   you can have high sustained confidence
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.180]   through any season.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.740]   - It's funny how so many of these big things in life
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.180]   seem to be able to be distilled into two things.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.680]   We had a conversation with Vanessa Van Edwards
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.700]   on Charisma, and she's like,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.280]   "It's a balance of competence and,"
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.860]   oh man, I just totally spaced it,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.900]   "Warmth and competence."
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500]   It's a balance between warmth and competence.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.340]   And it's like, if you can master those two things
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.460]   and the balance between them.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.500]   So I wanna dig into this, right?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.620]   Why is this not so obvious?
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.020]   Like why are we all walking around,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.740]   beating ourselves up and not taking bold actions?
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.260]   Is it that people don't know that that's what you need to do
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.600]   and that's your life's work?
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.540]   Or is it that it's actually really hard
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.220]   and there are easier ways to do it?
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.340]   Or maybe it's both.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.580]   - That's a great question.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.140]   I think a lot of people, if you intellectually ask them,
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.260]   are those things good to do?
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.740]   They'd be like, "Oh yeah, just like eating my vegetables
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.500]   "and working out every day and spending time slowing down,
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.480]   "unplugging from my phone and connecting with my spouse.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.720]   "Yeah, that's all, it's great."
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.380]   But are we doing all those things, right?
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.820]   And the reason we don't,
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.700]   just like we don't do all those other healthy habits,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   well, maybe some people do,
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.900]   but the reason it's a challenge to do something
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.540]   that sounds very simple
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.940]   is because there's an emotional driver
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.660]   underneath the surface.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.840]   And each one has a payoff.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.380]   The bold, I start with the bold action.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.840]   There's a huge set of payoffs for not taking bold action.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.520]   And one of the payoffs is we get to avoid the thing
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.060]   that everyone by default is trying to avoid in life,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.460]   which is pain.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.020]   And so, when we take a bold action,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.020]   we're gonna experience a variety of forms of pain.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.060]   Some of it's just discomfort.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.620]   To wake up, to focus, to take the action,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.940]   to consistently follow up, there's a discomfort to that.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.980]   And then there's an emotional discomfort
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.580]   of what if they don't like my show?
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.700]   What if someone doesn't agree with me?
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.840]   What if someone criticizes?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.640]   What if my work's not good enough?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.780]   What if I'm rejected?
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.320]   It all comes down to that, disapproved of, rejected.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.660]   And most people are so afraid of that
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.540]   and even unconsciously avoiding that,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.700]   that they push the action to later.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.900]   They make it way smaller, they delay it, they hesitate,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.100]   and they don't even necessarily know
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.420]   that that's what we're doing, right?
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.060]   It's just like, no, I'm busy, no, this.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.500]   But underneath, I'm scared.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.180]   And then we got our, you know,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.160]   we don't wanna, we wanna look macho.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.460]   We don't wanna say we're scared,
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.340]   so we say I'm stressed and I'm too busy.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.380]   So that's the payoff for the bold action.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.900]   You might say, what is the payoff for treating yourself bad?
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.020]   I mean, obviously that's terrible.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.460]   Well, I would say that it actually serves the same master.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.860]   So when I tell myself it's gonna fail, I'm not good,
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.220]   I didn't do that right, that's creating this,
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.620]   it's almost like a fog, an amnesia.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.980]   I kind of forget my strengths.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.220]   I'm sure you've done that, I've done that.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.060]   It's like two in the morning
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.180]   and the way you're seeing yourself
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.300]   is like this helpless, incompetent person.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.620]   You're like, wait a minute, that's weird.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.940]   Why am I even believing this?
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.500]   Because the more we believe that,
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.780]   we stay in this kind of shell.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.220]   It's like a protective walls of this negative identity.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.140]   I'm a nobody, who am I?
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.380]   And that nobody who's nothing
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.340]   is even further from taking that bold action.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.140]   And all of this is under the umbrella
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.020]   of what I call your safety police,
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.260]   which is like a mechanism in your psychology,
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.220]   you could think of it.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.460]   That is, its purpose is single fold.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.740]   It is to keep you safe.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.440]   And the safety police is like a survival mechanism inside
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.280]   that's run amok.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.720]   It's just too high, the dial is set too high.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.160]   And so safety means no pain, no rejection,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.240]   no threat, no danger, no risk.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.040]   And so you tell yourself you're a nobody
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.560]   and you avoid the action
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.720]   and you get to stay in that bubble,
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   which feels safer in the moment.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.640]   Of course, meanwhile, your life is passing you by.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.280]   - So it seems like both of those are a little bit
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.480]   like this voice in your head,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.600]   this inner critic that is kind of controlling you.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.720]   Is that a fair assumption?
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.040]   - Yes, yeah, the inner critic,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.680]   you could think of it as like the mouthpiece
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   of the safety police.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.200]   It's the one who's kind of narrating.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.640]   And the crazy thing is like, why do people believe it?
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.800]   It's almost like, because it's familiar
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.360]   and also because it has proximity.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.560]   You know, it's coming from in your head.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.920]   And so it's like, it's closer than your closest friend.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so like, where is that?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.880]   Okay, I guess that's true.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.080]   And I'll often do that with clients.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.720]   I'm like, where is that voice coming from?
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.560]   And they're like, what do you mean?
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.640]   Like, it's from my childhood.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.160]   Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, right now.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.920]   How are you even hearing that thing?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.840]   And then it's like a confusing mindfulness question.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.800]   I'm like, I don't know, right?
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   But it's close.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.080]   And all of a sudden we assume because it's close
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.440]   and we've heard it a lot, that it's true.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.480]   But if you pay attention,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   this is probably one of the tools
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.840]   I help clients break free with,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.720]   is if you pay attention to its track record of predictions,
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.440]   it's really bad.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.280]   It's really bad.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.240]   Oh, you're gonna fail at that meeting.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.680]   No one's gonna buy the thing.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.160]   And you go there and it goes okay,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.000]   and people buy the thing.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.640]   And the person would never go out with you.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.200]   And then the person goes out with you, right?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.960]   Maybe not that one, but the next one.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.480]   And if you look at its track record, it's terrible.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.960]   But then still the very next day,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.520]   think about that if you had like a financial advisor
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.160]   and they were just, they couldn't beat the market.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.920]   They were wrong all the time.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.280]   And you just keep going back to them.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.960]   And you're like, well, what do you think this time?
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.720]   And they're just so certain that you keep going to it.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.960]   And I think that's how we are with the inner critic.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.560]   - So what do we do with both of these areas
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.320]   and what are the tactics?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.000]   - A lot of people, when they discover this,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.560]   they're like, okay, how do I kill the critic, right?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.120]   It's the enemy, slay the demon.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.040]   And I don't think it works that way.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.240]   You can think of like the parts of our psychology
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.720]   as that old show Survivor.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.040]   I don't know if it's still running.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.600]   You can't vote them off the island.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.200]   You can't get rid of them, right?
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.400]   They actually are a part in there.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.920]   The problem is not the survivor and the safety police.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.240]   The problem is the dial, the setting is too high.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.200]   You do need some survival skills.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.240]   That prevents you from jumping off the 30 foot building
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.680]   and breaking your legs, right?
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.400]   It's like you have a sense of risk and all that.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.080]   The issue is that we need to turn the dial down.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.000]   And so, the first thing that people have to do
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.840]   is they have to even know this conversation
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   that we're having exists and say, wait a minute,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.680]   it's not just me, Aziz, or you, Chris.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.960]   There's a lot of Aziz's in there.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.160]   There's a lot of parts inside.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.960]   And one of the parts is this inner critic.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   So the first thing I do with people is,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.400]   can you know when your critic is talking?
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.280]   Do you know when it's you thinking versus the critic?
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.240]   Now, we don't have to get crazy, just philosophical,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.200]   like what is me, right?
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   But, you know, are you seeing clearly?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   Are you having a distorted view of yourself
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.000]   as incapable and unlovable?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.160]   You'll start to hear the critic and get better at it
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.200]   because you'll know, it's languages and extremes.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's gonna go awful.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.120]   Everyone's gonna think you're terrible.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.840]   It magnifies.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.280]   It's just like a fun house distorted mirror.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.520]   So you gotta get, one, is identify the critic
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360]   and just get good at it.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.400]   So with clients, I'll have them do an awareness exercise,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.880]   usually for like a week or two,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   where they're just noting it, tracking it.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120]   I'll have them name it too.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.800]   And some people just call it the critic.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.440]   Some people come up with these like pretty funny,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.560]   creative, silly names just to break the pattern
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.880]   a little bit.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   So you start to name it.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   Then the biggest technique, you could call it tool,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.000]   is not some hack to just know what to say.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.800]   It actually is deeper than that.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.280]   You have to make what I call the decision of a lifetime.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.640]   So I have a book called "On My Own Side,"
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.800]   which is guiding people through this.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.480]   And so you're aware of this critic.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.240]   And they're like, yeah, yeah, it's all the time.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   I can name it.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.900]   I can see it now.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.740]   Okay, great.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.080]   Take a moment and really pay attention
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.760]   to what's happening here.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.400]   Like really observe it for a while.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.480]   'Cause when you do,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.720]   hopefully there's some part inside of you.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.920]   It's like when you watch a movie or I mean,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.120]   maybe this has happened in your life.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.560]   You're watching someone be almost
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.920]   in an abusive relationship.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.000]   And if you're watching a movie and what's that one
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   from way back in the day, "This Boy's Life,"
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.240]   some just terrible, abusive stepfather.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.400]   When you're watching that movie
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.540]   and you're identifying with the young character,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.540]   every part of your body wants that young son or character
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.480]   to like stand up to that tyrant and say like,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.960]   this is effed up.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.520]   Like I'm leaving your house, I'm out, I'm done.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.480]   And basically people have to have that moment
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.200]   inside of themselves.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.560]   Because what happens is like, okay,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.080]   the critic's beating them up and they're believing it.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.220]   And they're like, okay, I caught it.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.560]   Now what do I do?
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.800]   But the energy is not there.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.680]   You need to have a revolution inside.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.000]   You need to usurp the power of the critic
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.560]   and take control of your inner self
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.000]   and be the captain of your ship, as I call it.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.800]   And that means like the critic is the parent
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.640]   kicking you around.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.040]   You need to become the parent.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.840]   So it's a decision and the decision comes
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   from like reaching a threshold moment of really observing,
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.720]   like this is effed up.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.900]   I can't, like what am I doing to myself?
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.580]   And you gotta have this sense of almost outrage
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.720]   or disgust or revulsion or something.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.600]   You say, all right, that's it.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.160]   I'm gonna take control here.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.180]   Because otherwise, before that decision,
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.920]   it always goes like this.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.800]   And I see this all the time.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.400]   People go to cognitive therapy.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.040]   They teach them how to deal with their negative thoughts,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.120]   which is their critic.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.960]   And they'll write out the critical thoughts.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.600]   You're a loser and nobody likes you.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.160]   And they're like, okay, what do I do?
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.200]   The therapist is like, challenge the thought.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.560]   And they're like, okay, I'm good.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.420]   And many people do like me.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.000]   Is that right?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.480]   And it's got no power because they're still,
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   they're framed, they're still living within the reality
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.360]   created by their critic.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.620]   They still see themselves that way.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.940]   And so we have to shatter that
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.580]   and be willing to see what's really true.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.840]   And I could go deeper and more granular, but I'll pause.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.300]   - Yeah, so I'm curious how applicable this is to everyone
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.220]   or is this kind of for people who found themselves
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.940]   so deep that they have no confidence?
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.960]   Because I imagine there's some people listening
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.500]   that don't necessarily feel like they don't have confidence.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.300]   They're willing to go to a meeting
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.280]   and feel like they're gonna do a great job,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.100]   but it could probably level up as well.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.980]   So I'm curious if you address some of the tactics
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.700]   you said, it's like, you make me feel like,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.260]   wow, like I'm not even sure I'm at that point yet.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.380]   However, I have no doubt that there is something
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.820]   to be learned for everyone.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.540]   So where does this, how does this calibrate for people?
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.020]   - This doesn't have to mean that you're impaired
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.780]   to the point where you can't go into that meeting,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.120]   but a lot of people will go into the meeting
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.900]   and what are they, the morning of the meeting,
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.860]   they're short with their spouse.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.060]   They're stressed out.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.060]   Like I got that meeting.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.300]   Maybe they had a little trouble.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.860]   You know, maybe they're confident.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.060]   But I think if you look at a lot of people,
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.860]   there's some fear underneath.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.580]   And the fear is like, this has to go good or else.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.380]   I have to make this presentation.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.740]   And they might say, I'm gonna crush it.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.780]   I'm gonna just nail it.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.620]   Maybe.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.940]   Now that's great.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.620]   Then you could observe, what are you doing?
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.020]   You probably are having,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.740]   you're probably reinforcing an identity,
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.540]   how you see yourself of capability.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.100]   I got this, I can do this.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.540]   And you know what that is?
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.780]   Their critic has been swapped out
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.500]   with what I would call an optimal self-coach.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.340]   And that's a process that you can observe.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.260]   So even if your critic's not terrible,
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.620]   you gotta start listening to it and say,
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.460]   well, what?
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.980]   You could ask this question before a meeting.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.020]   Am I nervous?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.140]   What am I telling myself?
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.020]   Who's, this is a great, powerful question.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.660]   Who's coaching me in my head right now?
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.500]   And then you could say,
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.740]   well, what would an optimal coach say?
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.180]   And you could think back if you've ever had a sports coach
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.700]   when you were young or a life coach as you got older
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.300]   or someone who was a mentor or a guide
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.580]   who actually fulfilled that role for you.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.180]   And like, well, what would they say?
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.420]   How would they perceive this?
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.620]   How, what would they, what would I think?
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.060]   And you can start to tap into that
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.460]   and draw on that before the meeting.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.060]   Usually with people with high confidence
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.500]   are kind of doing this unconsciously.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.780]   But I would say that there's still often
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.620]   a layer of fear underneath.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.860]   And that fear is some level of,
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.000]   if this doesn't go well, then dot, dot, dot.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.580]   And I think true, like the next level,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.020]   if you wanna talk about extraordinary confidence, right?
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.400]   It's the people that are willing to face that dot, dot, dot.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.820]   And to go into any scenario of life,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.340]   even the stuff that we would never want to occur.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.620]   And to not say, oh, great, I hope that happens.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.540]   But to say, you know what?
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.460]   If that happens, I'll be okay too.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.460]   I know I can handle anything.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.740]   That's when you get to a certain level of confidence
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.320]   where you're able to kind of move through life
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   without that roller coaster of fear and up and down.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.900]   - So I wanna double click a little,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.780]   'cause what I heard was, okay, everyone seems to,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.780]   whether you have no confidence or a lot of it,
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.020]   it sounds like you could have more
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.460]   and the impact on your life of having more would be great.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.220]   So you just need to confront
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.600]   and stand up to this inner critic.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.580]   Are there more kind of habits to build
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.140]   or types of coaching to kind of keep it going?
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.940]   'Cause it seems like it'd be easy one morning to be like,
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.780]   you know what?
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.620]   Forget it, this is gonna be great.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.940]   But that doesn't mean that it's gonna last forever.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.700]   - Yes, okay, so here's a simple one.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.580]   You wanna think about, I think it's helpful
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.340]   when you think about what habits to do,
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.020]   is like, what's the outcome?
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.860]   What are we trying to do?
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.240]   And you say, well, I'm trying to build my confidence.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.100]   Yes, but what you're really trying to do
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.860]   to have high confidence is you have a,
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.180]   when you, when your identity is expanded enough
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.300]   for whatever it is you're trying to do,
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.960]   you don't need to like pep talk yourself.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.720]   So I'm sure there's things that you can do.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.840]   I don't know, there's something in your life
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.880]   where you feel like it's not,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.960]   you don't think about it as confidence
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.240]   'cause you've just done it so many times
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.400]   that it's no big deal.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.840]   Is there anything in your life like a hobby
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.640]   or a work task or anything?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.680]   I know you do a lot of travel.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.600]   So for some people, travel is overwhelming.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   Like, oh my God, where would I even go?
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.320]   I don't know if that even feels that way to you
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.280]   at this point.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.120]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.660]   It's like, I don't stress out about,
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.180]   we're taking this trip we talked about
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   right before we started in a couple of weeks
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.180]   and we have no idea where we're going.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.180]   And I know a lot of people will be very overwhelmed.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.740]   It's like, we're going on a trip for a week.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.580]   In two weeks, we have no idea what we're doing.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.900]   And I'm like, no, I just know
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.460]   that we're gonna be able to find a great trip.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.180]   It's just not, it doesn't even bother me.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.220]   My wife's like, well, yeah,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.460]   but I might need to buy some clothes
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.860]   if it's gonna be cold or warm.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.340]   So it'd be good to know, you know,
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.420]   on more than a day's notice.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.860]   But for me, I'm like, yeah, we got,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.680]   I have warm clothes, I have cold clothes.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.920]   I'm pretty confident we'll have a good trip.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.760]   Yes, okay.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.620]   So you can hear there's like a relaxed sense of certainty
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.900]   around that.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.460]   And a lot of people wouldn't have that.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.300]   I don't travel.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   I used to travel a lot when I was younger.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.080]   I haven't traveled that much in the last like,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.420]   I don't know, seven, eight years.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.220]   And so for me, it'd just be like,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.220]   I don't know if I'd be like overstressed about it,
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.460]   but it would be kind of like more than you, right?
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.820]   'Cause there's something different there.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.860]   So what's the differentiating factor there?
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.900]   It's that you're, there's a level of,
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.100]   my sense is you've probably traveled a lot.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.220]   You do a show that involves some travel, right?
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.340]   So you've expanded your identity.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.360]   So Chris includes travel, got it.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.540]   How did you expand the identity to include that?
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.900]   You weren't born that way.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.940]   Did you grow up with world traveler parents?
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.780]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.600]   I mean, I wouldn't say that, definitely travel.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.340]   My grandparents traveled a lot.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.700]   My parents traveled, we went places, so yes.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.620]   - So there you go.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.300]   So you had this exposure and practice
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.860]   and it becomes normal would maybe be the best way.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.660]   It's familiar and normal for you to do that kind of thing.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.500]   So now we're gonna go on a trip in a couple of weeks,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.740]   no big deal.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.480]   That's like someone who, you know,
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.060]   I had a buddy when I was young who was like one of those
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.460]   straight out of a movie hacker nerd kids.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.700]   And this was when the internet,
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.980]   this was in like '97 or something, '95.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.020]   So, you know, everything was simpler in a way,
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.540]   like the computer systems, the internet,
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.740]   and he could just like, you know,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.540]   furiously type and like literally at the school library
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.460]   be like in the administrator section of the school.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.780]   I'm like, what are you doing, right?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.540]   Because he grew up on computers.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.660]   He just knew how to do that stuff.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.460]   So what does all this have to do with, you know,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.720]   confidence at work in our lives and that sort of thing
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.620]   is that we need to expand our identity
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.140]   so that we see ourselves as like, this is no big deal.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.420]   This is normal for me.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.660]   Otherwise it's always a, oh my God,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.060]   am I gonna pull this off?
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.180]   I don't know, that whole, I don't know.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.580]   That's a reflection that you don't see
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.700]   as a part of your normal identity yet.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.060]   So we want to expand our identity.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.300]   So the habits have to be expanding our identity
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.180]   to include that.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.140]   So one thing we can do is to do the thing, right?
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.860]   Like start getting exposure to it.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.500]   And that sounds so simple,
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.300]   but if we're not great at it yet,
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.660]   or it causes stress for us, we slow the process down.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   We're like, I'll get to that next month.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.540]   I'll do it once in a while.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.020]   Like, no, the biggest change is gonna go on offense,
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.940]   I like to call it.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.640]   So let's say you do okay at work meetings,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.580]   but you want to just like own the room.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.100]   You want to be like a powerful force of leadership
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.400]   and speaking up and authority.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.900]   So then you say, okay, I'm gonna have a commitment.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.420]   Like every single meeting, I'm gonna intentionally speak up
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.900]   and I'm gonna intentionally steer at once.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.660]   I'm gonna intentionally ask a question.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.300]   And so you start to build that.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.700]   That's the action side.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.020]   Now the habit that really strengthens that,
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.180]   and it serves multiple purposes.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.540]   It neutralizes the critic and it builds your optimal coach.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.060]   And this one is right after the meeting is done,
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.340]   force yourself, don't just do it in your head,
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.900]   force yourself to do it on a note file on your phone
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.060]   or on a sheet of paper if you want to do it old school,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.180]   where you write down three wins
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.620]   from the meeting right afterwards.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.300]   What are three things that you did that went well?
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.540]   You might say, no, no, I don't need to do that.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.860]   I know it was fine, it went great.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.940]   No, no, no, this is gonna really
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.300]   like encode it into your identity.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.260]   So you say, well, I spoke up there, I did this.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.260]   And it doesn't matter what you write down.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.020]   It matters that you're training your brain to say,
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.380]   hey, when I go into these situations, I'm competent.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.100]   Remember you were talking about Vanessa Van Edwards,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.220]   competence and warmth, right?
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.760]   So yes, you say, I know I'm competent.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.900]   Not all of you knows that all of the time.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.660]   So what this is doing is like linking your brain.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.940]   So I do this and I'll do this with clients.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:17.780]   Well, let's say if you write down
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.900]   three things like that a day,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.980]   and within like two to three weeks,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.540]   there's a man I worked with who is,
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.900]   he was already very successful.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.980]   He ran multiple companies,
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.980]   but he basically felt like
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.180]   he wasn't never successful enough.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.940]   And so he started to do this because in his mind,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.780]   at the end of the day,
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.080]   he cataloged all the things he didn't do well enough,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.140]   even though he was successfully running three companies.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.020]   And so with this practice,
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.380]   he started to simply write down
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.940]   three things at the end of each day that he did well.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.020]   And within three weeks,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.500]   he's like, something, a big shift happened.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.340]   I was like, what?
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.420]   He's like, well, I was talking with my wife
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   and in an offhand manner,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.020]   I referred to myself as successful.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.620]   And for him, this guy who runs three companies,
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.380]   he's like multi-millionaire.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.300]   For him, the moment that he knew he was a success
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.100]   was when he casually told his wife something
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.900]   and implying he was successful.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.980]   So that's the power I think
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.140]   of really upgrading our identity.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.420]   - And is that making a point to speak up in a meeting
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.100]   or take charge,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.020]   is that the bold side of the two habits you wanted to build
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.460]   or is that something different?
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.740]   - Yeah, that would be an example.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.420]   For a number of people, that might be a challenge.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.620]   And whatever the bold action is,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.020]   how do you know what it is?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.220]   It's whatever makes you uncomfortable
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.060]   or scares you a lot.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.220]   Generally, if it freaks you out,
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.380]   you probably have to work up to it.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.180]   Think of it as like weight training.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.420]   You're not gonna just bench press 300 pounds
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.820]   if you can't bench press 150.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.780]   So practice and repetition of the smaller amounts.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.180]   But yes, that would be an example of bold action.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.460]   - Yeah, I was talking to,
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.020]   we went to a birthday party for a three-year-old
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.540]   this weekend and one of the parents said,
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.380]   "Oh, have you ever traveled with your kids?"
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.340]   And I was like, "Yeah, we went to London and Paris."
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.180]   And they're like, "Whoa, we could never do that."
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.500]   And I was like, "Okay, then why don't you go for a weekend?"
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.540]   I was just trying to tell them
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.300]   they're not gonna ever feel like they could travel
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.580]   with their kids as much as they want
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.660]   until they just do it.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.340]   So I assume that is a little bit of what you have to do
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.420]   and you don't have to go
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.620]   and take an international trip right away,
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.900]   but maybe you just go somewhere for a night,
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.340]   go somewhere for a weekend.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.820]   - 100%, it's a gradual exposure.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.860]   It's a 10-pound weight
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.260]   and you work your way up to 20, 30, and so forth.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.260]   And most people will never,
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.140]   in their mind, it's like the 100-pound weight or nothing.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.180]   I wanna go international.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.860]   We'll do it when they're teenagers.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.020]   And then it's like, but what about the overnight?
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.180]   Ah, that's not enough.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.020]   Ah, I don't know.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.900]   And we all do this.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.900]   The small stuff is like, nah, nah, nah.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   But really, it's the only way to get that confidence.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.860]   - And when it comes to the inner critic,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.020]   can you talk to me about what the difference is
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.500]   between kind of planning for the worst
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.380]   and feeling like the worst is gonna happen?
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.980]   I think sometimes my wife and I have these debates
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.060]   where I'm like, everything's gonna be great.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.620]   And she's like, well, what if this happens?
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.660]   What if this happens?
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.420]   And I don't actually think she's necessarily saying
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.860]   it's going to happen.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   She's just like, well, we should be prepared
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.620]   because if something does go wrong,
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.900]   we wanna make sure that we have a contingency,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.380]   a plan, enough diapers, enough extra snacks.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.940]   And I'm like, well, if the kids are hungry,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.300]   we'll go find a store and buy some stuff and it'll be okay.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.180]   And I think we both realize
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.540]   that we balance each other out well,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.060]   'cause I'm like, nothing's gonna go wrong.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.340]   Everything's gonna be perfect.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.740]   And I wouldn't say she says everything's gonna go wrong.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.700]   She just wants to make sure we're prepared if it does.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.900]   You know, not making this about my wife per se,
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.220]   but is there something, is that a self-critic
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.460]   or is that a preparedness
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.740]   or is there a blurry line between the two?
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.140]   - That's a great question.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.420]   Also, a similar dynamic between me and my wife.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.460]   I don't know if that's like roles or personality styles
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.460]   or, you know, male-female energy,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.100]   but it's definitely like, what do we need?
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.540]   Like, okay, whatever, let's just grab, let's go.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.060]   We've definitely been on hikes with my boys
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.580]   where we ran out of water and stuff.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.220]   And I'm like, well, we survived.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.460]   But yes, so I think you're highlighting a great point here.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.780]   There is, it all comes back to risk
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.020]   and our willingness to take risk.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.620]   And each person has a different level of risk tolerance.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.460]   And if someone's risk tolerance is a little lower,
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.620]   it doesn't mean it's bad.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.460]   It might mean they're prepared, right?
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.660]   You know, I'm not gonna take the risk of bringing nothing.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.740]   Let's bring these three things
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.740]   so that we have some supplies.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.780]   There's a downside to that.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.620]   You gotta think of the things,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.020]   you gotta carry them around, right?
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.580]   Like, so we all find our balance there.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.740]   And in day-to-day life, as you're describing,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.380]   you know, probably not too significant of an impact.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.860]   I'd say the problem can come in
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.740]   when people start becoming less willing
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.020]   or even unwilling to tolerate risk.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.900]   That would be your wife saying,
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.420]   I can't go until I have three backpacks,
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.340]   diapers, foods, disaster supplies.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.100]   You know, it starts to become really extreme.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.740]   I'd say, well, that's over the top.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.340]   But people do that in their lives.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.180]   I'm not gonna start my business
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.340]   until I have this lined up and I've achieved that.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.100]   And I have X amount of money in the bank
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.860]   and this and that, and the kids are older.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.220]   And now the business has never started.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.420]   I'm not gonna have children
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.820]   until I got A and B and C and D all lined up.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.820]   And then they don't have children, right?
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.500]   So people will avoid significant positive risks
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.740]   in their lives because they are unwilling to tolerate.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.540]   And that's the key thing, to lean into the risk,
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.900]   we have to be able to tolerate uncertainty,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.060]   the I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.780]   And the boogeyman that stops us from doing that
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.020]   is the mind says, okay, well, we don't know.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.820]   Could be awesome, could be fun, could be spontaneous.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.580]   It could be death.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.620]   It could be the terrible thing, right?
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.340]   And because of the human prediction machine
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.340]   that is our brain, it can, within a quarter of a second,
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.980]   imagine, see, and even feel like the death of your child
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.740]   or a financial ruin, you know, which is pretty intense.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.900]   You're sitting there eating your cereal
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.860]   and all of a sudden you go, ah, financial ruin, right?
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.340]   Like that's a significant emotional impact.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.180]   And so what do you do with that?
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.940]   And people that have anxiety, you know,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.980]   if we get caught into anxiety or we're catastrophizing,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.420]   we can really live in that place
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.420]   and start to imagine that it's gonna happen.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.660]   And the key there is to take a step back.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.900]   I would say start with like your nervous system.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.820]   Are you ramped up?
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.460]   Are you breathing really rapidly?
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.700]   Are you shoveling food, junk food in your face?
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:44.620]   Like take a moment, as simple as it might sound,
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.260]   take like three breaths where you slowly breathe in
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.660]   and count to where you're breathing out longer
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.660]   than you're breathing in.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.660]   And then ask yourself, is this like,
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.340]   what kind of risk am I afraid of?
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.100]   What's the line here?
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.580]   And usually we can see like there's a certain line
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.420]   that makes sense.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   And then, but what if, but what if, what if,
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.700]   and then at some point we have to be willing
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.620]   to go into the what if and say, you know what?
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.940]   The odds are very, very low that would happen.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.540]   But if that would happen, let's face that.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.180]   And I'm not saying you're really gonna have a kid die
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.780]   or something, but I mean like in that moment,
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.620]   you emotionally face it 'cause the fear feeds on avoidance
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.460]   and flight.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.380]   And if you turn to face it and you face the fear
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.140]   for just a moment, what you'll notice is that
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.060]   it gets really intense, but if you just let it rip
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.020]   through you, it will, without needing to do anything,
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.060]   the moment will pass, the storm will pass,
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.060]   and you're okay to take the step forward.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.780]   The problem most people make is they're like,
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.700]   but what if it leads to that?
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.460]   And then they just stop.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.180]   It's like getting to the edge of the cliff
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.820]   and not even looking down.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.420]   And what you need to do is become really mindful
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.300]   at the edge and say, okay, what it is is we're at the edge
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.820]   and if you look at every catastrophic thought,
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.140]   it's all about loss, pain, and survival stuff.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.540]   Always what it is.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.420]   And underneath what it is is we all know
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.940]   that this is impermanent.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.780]   Like none of this stuff is, we don't have control.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.380]   We don't really know what's gonna happen.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.660]   The people that we love, it's extraordinary
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.580]   and our hearts are bonded,
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.060]   but something could happen to anyone.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.420]   You know, our lifestyles, everything is in flux and change.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.220]   And it might be steady for decades and it might change.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.900]   And we know that, and so what we need to do
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.020]   when we're facing our catastrophic thoughts
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.140]   is we're facing impermanence.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.860]   And we need to look it in the face
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.180]   and there's a part inside that's like,
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.860]   the problem is not that things are gonna change
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.780]   or that something, quote, bad could happen.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.820]   The problem is that you are fighting it
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.140]   and bracing against it and unwilling.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.540]   You're saying, no, I do not sign that contract with life.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.820]   I will not accept that something unpleasant
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.660]   could happen to me.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.100]   And you clench everything inside.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.620]   You get anxious and it doesn't do anything.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.820]   It's not like the universe is like,
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.620]   oh, he's really tight in his bowels.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.380]   Let's like give him what he wants.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.380]   So the only thing to do, the only sanity is to practice
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.460]   having a practice of surrender and letting go
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.340]   and saying, look, if that happens,
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.220]   (exhales)
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.900]   I will face that then.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.380]   And it's not a verbal thing.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.020]   It's in your body.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.860]   It's a physiologically softening and letting go.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.420]   - I guess an interesting takeaway for me
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.900]   is confidence doesn't have to be optimism.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.700]   It sounds like confidence can be acceptance
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.660]   that it might not be the optimal.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.300]   I think in my mind, it was always,
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.100]   well, I think this is gonna go well
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.420]   so I can be confident going into it.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.700]   But you could also be confident going into it
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.940]   and say, it might not go well.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.660]   I'm just confident that whatever happens, I can deal with.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.740]   - That's the underpinning of confidence.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.780]   That's like the, because the other one,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.060]   the other one's not bad.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.500]   The other one, you could think of it as optimism
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.300]   or positive anticipation.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   And that will tilt the scales in your favor, right?
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.580]   If you go into a social interaction being like,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.180]   people are gonna like me, this is gonna be great.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.100]   We're gonna have fun.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.940]   Like it's, you tilt it in your favor
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.420]   versus going in like, this is gonna suck.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.060]   I don't even like people already, right?
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.340]   Of course, that's gonna tilt it the other way.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.940]   Now you can go and be like, oh, this is gonna be fun.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.540]   You can say you're meeting a friend of a friend
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.140]   at this party and oh, we're gonna connect.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.260]   I've been wanting to meet this person for so long.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.620]   You know, it's gonna tilt it in your favor.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.100]   And still though, you get there
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.260]   and the person's standoffish or, right?
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.660]   You don't have control.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.300]   So we have to say, look, it's probably gonna go well.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.860]   I am capable of connect.
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.140]   I can talk to anybody, right?
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.540]   That's the identity piece.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.860]   That sets you up for positive anticipation.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.980]   But then you remove the background fear of like,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.300]   but what if it doesn't?
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.860]   It's like, well, I'll be okay.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.580]   And that is the sentence that I think captures
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.580]   the most unconditional confidence is either way,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.220]   I'll be okay.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.060]   - Okay.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.620]   So I'm gonna try to do a quick recap.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.140]   There's these two big habits
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.060]   and one of them is that you wanna be on your own side
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.580]   and you just gotta stand up to the self-critic.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.940]   And the other is that you need to put yourself out there
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.020]   and take some bold actions.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.660]   Any other kind of bold discomfort practice
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.540]   that people can do?
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.140]   Things that they could exercises?
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:16.980]   - Yeah.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.860]   My favorite one is a visceral one
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.020]   and it's not with the mind at all.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.180]   And it's a cold plunge.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.620]   And if you don't have a cold plunge,
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.260]   you can do a cold shower.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.820]   And it's, you know, that's,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.020]   but maybe that's come up on your show a lot.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.340]   I don't know if it's, it's a big hack,
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.020]   but it's from a psychological perspective,
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.460]   there's physiological benefits too.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.780]   But just facing the every morning
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.140]   before I go into the cold plunge,
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:43.060]   there is a voice in my head that says, I don't want to.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.420]   Like every morning, it doesn't matter how long I've done it.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.060]   And it's like, it's a practice.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.460]   I'm going to override this because it's for my benefit.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.940]   And I'll even sometimes say to myself,
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.780]   it's like, I don't want to.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.020]   And I'm like, I do want to.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.180]   Because when I face what's uncomfortable,
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.260]   my life is better for it.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.420]   And of course, the cool thing about the cold plunge
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.060]   is that you get an immediate payoff.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.820]   Like it's not even when you get out.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:11.700]   For me, the first one, it's like the four seconds
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.500]   of getting in and submerging my head.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.220]   And then when I'm sitting in it, it's uncomfortable,
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.100]   but it's like intense and kind of fun and weird.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.700]   I think I'm in an altered state almost.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.140]   - Yeah, the hard part was getting in.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.980]   - Hard part's getting in.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.020]   And that's a great metaphor
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.700]   'cause that's the same thing for whatever it might be.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.860]   The hardest part of the risk is jumping.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.660]   It's walking towards those people you don't know
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.300]   and want to create a business connection with, right?
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.460]   It's calling the person up.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.820]   It's starting the thing.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.100]   It's initiating.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.380]   'Cause then once you're in it, you're in the moment, right?
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.580]   You're talking to the person.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.620]   And now it's off to the races.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.180]   So, I think that's a really powerful practice
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.300]   is the cold plunge.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.020]   On the physical side, I like to do those as well
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.700]   'cause I think they're so,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.060]   they transmit a message that's not just
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.940]   us talking to ourselves.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.260]   So, another physical thing for anyone could be there,
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.100]   it is some sort of athletic pursuit
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.740]   where you have a practice of doing something consistently
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.340]   that's uncomfortable even though you don't want to sometimes.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.340]   Whatever it is for you.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.220]   I don't care the sport or activity.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.540]   But I think that and the cold plunge
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.900]   are really foundational things
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.940]   that you might not think be related
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.780]   to your confidence at all.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.980]   But they're very much related to the psychology
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.100]   of being able to go into discomfort
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.540]   because going into discomfort equals freedom.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.420]   - I thought you were gonna bring up
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.900]   asking people to give you money
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.340]   'cause I've heard you talk about that in the past.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.180]   - That's so fun.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.580]   So, oh man, talk about like rejection practice
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.420]   and other things.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.820]   Those are on the social side
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.540]   and those are truly liberating as well.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.100]   - Yeah, so just talk a little bit about that exercise.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.940]   - Yes, okay.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.900]   So, this is for fear of rejection
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.820]   and a lot of people might say,
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.220]   "I don't have a fear of rejection."
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.820]   It's like, okay, try these exercises
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.380]   and see if that's true or not.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.900]   So, here's a great one is you basically,
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.980]   you walk up to someone and you ask a question
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.860]   that you are basically 100% certain
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.140]   you're gonna get a no for.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.620]   And one of the simplest ones for that is can I have $100?
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.420]   Or whatever the currency of your choice is
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.500]   that's equivalent to a large amount of money.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.660]   And you do it in a friendly, warm way.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.220]   So, that's where it makes it fun, right?
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.260]   It's like you're asking them for what time is it?
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.420]   Or do you know a restaurant?
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.060]   But you're saying, "Hey, can I have $100?"
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.660]   And it confuses people 'cause you're not begging,
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.940]   you're not like, "Oh, poor me."
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.420]   You're just like, "Hey, I have $100."
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.020]   And you get all kinds of fun reactions.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.580]   But you'd be surprised,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.340]   your heart might be pounding before you go do it.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.660]   Why is your heart pounding?
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.740]   'Cause you're in fight or flight, why?
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.420]   Because there's break, it could be the rejection.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.100]   It could also be that you're breaking like a social norm.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.220]   You're disturbing,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.060]   this is a whole topic we can dive into it,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.100]   but I would call the cultural field.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.300]   So, there's an invisible field,
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.700]   just like gravity is invisible,
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.100]   but it's affecting us right now.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.660]   That's why we're staying in our chairs.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.660]   The cultural field is affecting you right now.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.220]   Even in this interview, it's affecting us.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.260]   How I talk, how I use my face,
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.140]   why I'm not, for those who are watching,
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   why am I not going like this?
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.860]   Like me, I just did it.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   But it's because the cultural,
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.980]   if you were to do that in a work meeting, right?
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.380]   People would be like, does he have a condition?
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.180]   Like, should we be, you know, is this okay?
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.780]   Right, it's unusual.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.860]   And so, but social freedom,
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.180]   which is part of confidence is,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.780]   as long as you're not hurting somebody
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.180]   or being aggressive or something,
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.740]   but you just to be able to free to wear what you want,
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.620]   say what you want, laugh out loud,
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.580]   ask whatever you want of anybody,
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.780]   that requires this kind of bold action of getting rejected.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.500]   So asking for $100 is a great one.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.220]   And I have some fun stories of at my events,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.380]   people will go out and ask for all kinds of things.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.820]   And shockingly, they actually end up getting yeses
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.580]   more than you'd think for stuff
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.260]   that would almost certainly seem to be a no.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.020]   - I mean, you gotta give a couple examples there.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.660]   - Okay, so the man, this one, you can see.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.500]   Someone walks up to someone at a restaurant.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.780]   Hey, can I have a, they have a chips and guacamole.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   Can I have one of your chips and dip it in your guacamole?
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.260]   They say, okay.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.700]   Yeah, you might say, that's not crazy.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.340]   Here's another one that I was really surprised by.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.900]   This was surprising.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.700]   A man walks up to a woman who's outside
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.180]   at a Mexican restaurant and she's eating a burrito.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.540]   And he says, excuse me.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.380]   She says, what?
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.300]   No preamble, excuse me.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.860]   Yes, can I have a bite of your burrito?
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.100]   And I mean, like, she's gonna let him eat it?
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.900]   And she's like, okay.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.740]   And gives him a bite of her burrito.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.500]   Another one, someone says, hey, can I take your bicycle?
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.620]   The guy's on a bike.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.240]   Can I take your bike for a spin around the block?
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.620]   The guy says, yes.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.220]   We've had people get nos to that stuff.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.700]   And this is my favorite one.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.660]   A woman goes up to someone who's got a dog.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.260]   And she says, hey, can I take your dog for a walk?
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.300]   No preamble.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.460]   And the woman's like, okay.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.860]   And then this person who's participating at the event,
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.200]   their goal is to rack up rejection.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.940]   She doesn't wanna sit there walking someone's dog.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.820]   So she's like, actually, I don't want to.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.020]   She walks away.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.460]   The person's like, what?
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.260]   So there you go, social freedom.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.100]   - I like it.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.300]   Let's talk for a second about social freedom.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.900]   It's something that until I was kind of reading up
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.740]   on your work, it's not even something I'd heard of.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.100]   So what does it mean?
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.220]   And what can it do for your life by having more of it?
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.380]   - Yeah, as far as I know,
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.660]   I haven't heard that term anywhere else.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.240]   I just came up with it 'cause I was thinking of like,
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.820]   what's the opposite of social anxiety, right?
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.760]   It was like a social confidence, but yeah,
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.600]   but it's actually, it's like social freedom.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.140]   So the idea is you're free to be 100% you
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.900]   and do what you want in the world
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.260]   and not be restricted by the cultural field.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.820]   Obviously you have constraints, there's laws,
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.860]   there's things that don't feel good
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.700]   to your own personal ethics, right?
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.820]   But most people are in a cage that's much tighter than that.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.180]   It's not the laws, it's, oh, my mom told me
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.660]   I was bothering people when I was young,
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.940]   so I don't want to bother people.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.700]   Oh, I learned when I was in junior high
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.500]   that if I look too interested, then I'm desperate.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.760]   Okay, I'm going to look cool, right?
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   We have all like hundreds of little conclusions
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.260]   and if then statements of how we should be
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   in order to be good, lovable, worthwhile,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.400]   attractive, all these things.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.120]   And so we're operating in this cage
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.820]   that ultimately though, it's not really you.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.220]   And the kicker is you're actually more attractive,
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.160]   more lovable when you step outside of that cage
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.220]   and you let your natural enthusiastic self,
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.860]   your funny self, your quirky self, your weird self,
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.340]   all the things that make you you
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.220]   that you were connected to when you were like 10 years old,
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.060]   you bring them back in.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.460]   And that's something that we actually have to consciously do.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.460]   And man, I've seen people who are like
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.180]   powerhouses in business.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.460]   They're so confident and they seem like
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.580]   they have no issues with this.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.120]   And then to go walk down a street
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.920]   and say hi to 15 or 20 strangers,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.860]   it makes them nervous.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.060]   It kind of freaks them 'cause like,
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   oh, I'm confident in this role as a business person,
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.260]   but the social freedom of I get to be
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.700]   whoever I want around people scares them.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.860]   And so that's just another place
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.180]   that we wanna practice those two things, right?
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.340]   Changing the way you talk to yourself,
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.820]   being on your own side and doing the bold things
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.220]   that make you uncomfortable
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.380]   so you can free yourself socially.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.020]   - So we got social freedom, we've got confidence.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.680]   Are there other byproducts of kind of,
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.540]   or ways to use these two habits to increase our happiness,
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.840]   our satisfaction in life or anything?
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.020]   - Well, I mean, I don't know if you can
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.780]   officially claim this one on internet marketing,
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.380]   but I have an internal phrase that I say,
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.140]   which is double your confidence, double your income.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.660]   And I truly believe, and I've seen this in people,
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.540]   that as you grow in your confidence,
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.940]   if you're willing to take bold action,
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.540]   which means here's some bold actions
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.380]   that a lot of people,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.620]   it's not just saying hi to a stranger
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.780]   or getting a date or something,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.340]   it's can you ask?
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.140]   A bold action is to ask for something,
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   to ask directly, to ask unapologetically.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.700]   And there are hundreds of examples
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.780]   if you're willing to ask, life can give you what you want.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.580]   And so I've seen people who renegotiate,
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.420]   who ask for promotions, who renegotiate salaries,
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.100]   who've been at companies for years and have never done that.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.020]   And they're kind of maybe waiting for the employer
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.600]   to be like, oh, here you go.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.100]   And maybe that happens,
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.620]   but often you gotta kind of advocate for it.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.220]   And all of a sudden they do it
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.940]   and they're expecting how dare you,
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.180]   you ingrateful, horrible person, you're fired or whatever.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.380]   And the negotiators are like, yeah.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.980]   Sometimes it's like, yes, okay, here you go.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.460]   Other times it's like, well, not now.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.580]   And then I coach them instead of being like,
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.260]   okay, fine, sorry, sorry.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.340]   They're like, you know what?
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.340]   Okay, well, can you tell me more about when that might be
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.060]   or what might I do that might warrant
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.740]   that kind of promotion or pay increase, right?
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.100]   Like being in that direct contact
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.020]   with their employer, with coworkers.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.860]   Running a business is all about asking people
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.660]   to promote you, to work with you,
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.740]   to buy your products or services.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.380]   And I can't tell you how many people
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.200]   are not as successful in their own businesses
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.780]   because they're afraid to boldly ask people
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.980]   to buy their stuff through the form
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.380]   of marketing calls to action.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.000]   So, and I did, I did all this stuff.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.840]   So for me, it'd be like,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.560]   I'm gonna put a lot of free teachings out there.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.480]   And then maybe if you wanna buy something,
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.660]   you'll just do it, I guess.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.340]   And I learned I had to actually be able to say,
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.520]   hey, if you're enjoying this
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.780]   and you're benefiting from this,
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.260]   go check out this program.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.740]   Here's why you want it, right?
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.660]   So being able to ask boldly.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.100]   So if you do those things,
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.940]   plus you keep expanding your identity
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.340]   to see yourself as successful and capable,
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.820]   I've seen people change jobs,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.100]   start businesses, grow businesses,
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.740]   and definitely increase their income
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.820]   from just these two habits as well.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.820]   - I got an email the other day that said,
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.260]   hey, I work for this company
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.820]   and we have a client who wants to understand more
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.580]   about the automated investment advisory space.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.060]   Your background looks like you know,
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.820]   would you be up to do a one hour call?
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.040]   And I do a two minute call with this guy.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.020]   He's like, yeah, right now the rate is $300 an hour.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.500]   And I was like, I was thinking $1,000 an hour.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.700]   Like, you know, it's one hour,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.920]   it's not a long-term commitment.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.900]   It felt like an opportunity to just see what happens.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.500]   And he's like, I think we could do that.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.700]   And I was like, that was more than three X
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.660]   for just a response.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.420]   - Yeah, double your confidence, triple your income
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.140]   doesn't have the same alliterative flow,
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.300]   but you know, look at that, double your income or more.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   And that's the crazy thing, right?
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.540]   It's you are bold enough to ask
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.920]   and you could have gotten a no or a negotiation or whatever,
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.580]   but so many people, so many of us, myself included,
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.700]   we just won't ask, why?
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.100]   Oh, because it's uncomfortable and it's unconscious.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.740]   Oh, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.140]   And it's, but that moment right there is no different
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.500]   than getting into the cold plunge, right?
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.780]   There might be like a, okay, so that's exciting.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.460]   And then once that happens though,
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.340]   it sets up a cascade where you're like,
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.380]   hey, this is what I do.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.140]   People pay me a thousand dollars per hour, which is true.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.460]   And so now, and you could even say that, right?
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.060]   And this person's like, well, how much do you charge?
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.540]   We were thinking 300.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.460]   Well, people typically pay me a thousand.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.540]   So that's what I'd be willing to do.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.220]   If you want to do some sort of longer term thing,
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.940]   we might be able to negotiate something different,
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.660]   but for a one-off it's a thousand, right?
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.540]   Now, what is that?
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.540]   That's your identity has expanded.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.940]   - Yeah, I think that one was hard for me
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.440]   and it took some practice over some time.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.640]   So we've talked a bunch about kind of the inner critic
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.480]   and the fear.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.420]   One of the places I face that the most
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.260]   is when I'm trying to make some decision,
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.360]   usually in an area I'm actually probably more confident in.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.940]   So it's saving money or it's booking travel.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.140]   And I have this fear that I could be making
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.780]   a more optimal decision.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.740]   It could be as silly as, you know,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.980]   I'm buying groceries online and I'm trying to make sure
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.260]   that I get the best deal of the basket of goods
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.380]   or it's, I'm trying to pick a hotel
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.100]   and I want to get the best hotel.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.940]   And this critic is like telling me,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.760]   oh, well, like maybe if you just do a little bit
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.680]   more research, you'll come to this optimal answer.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.160]   And it's kind of in the lines of maximizing
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.640]   versus satisficing, but can I use these habits
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.840]   in that situation or is there something about that fear
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.520]   that I need to recognize that I won't make the best choice?
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.080]   - Well, I think that would be the interesting question
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.800]   to look at is, so maybe that's true.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.040]   Maybe you could find a hotel that is cheaper
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.860]   or has better bang for your buck
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.240]   based upon whatever things you're looking for.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.880]   Let's just say that that's true.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.840]   What is painful, like there's a part of you
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.140]   that's like, no!
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.200]   But I guess we want to investigate that.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.420]   Like why is that so unacceptable?
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.640]   Right, and that's the part that we would want to go into
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.520]   and be like, okay, there's some feeling inside.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.480]   My sense is it's almost like if we don't get the best thing,
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:48.000]   it's almost like unsafe, like something bad is happening.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.360]   Is that what it is for you?
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.080]   - Yeah, I mean, maybe it's the,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.960]   I could have gotten a better deal/experience,
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.040]   but I think I've heard you even say something
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.180]   along the lines of even the optimal outcome
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.240]   still has some negative possibility.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.200]   So there is no optimal outcome, I guess, is the real answer.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.680]   - Well, you're choosing a circumstance
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.580]   and every circumstance in our life,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.280]   every hotel, every trip, every date,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.840]   every day of your life is going to have a mixture
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.820]   of good and bad, pleasure, discomfort, pain.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.440]   There is 100% no day that's avoidable of that.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.080]   And if you have the greatest day of your life,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.440]   it's all orchestrated and all the activities are fun,
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.320]   you'll have challenge with your emotional state.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.880]   You'll be like bummed out or anxious
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.440]   for whatever reason, you don't know why, right?
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.480]   So we cannot control it all.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.280]   And so I think that's helpful
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.400]   'cause the allure of the maximizing pattern
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.120]   is like, well, if I could just nail
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.000]   the right combo of external factors out there,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.680]   I'm gonna get the perfect day, the perfect trip,
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.680]   the perfect experience.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.000]   And that unconsciously is thinking,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.580]   perfect means all pleasure, no pain,
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.200]   all good times, no frustrating moments.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.760]   And when you say, you know what,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.260]   this amazing hotel is gonna have some great things about it
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.080]   and there's gonna be something at this hotel
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.480]   that I don't like, even if it's the best price,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.200]   best deal, best everything.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.440]   And this one also over here is gonna have some great things
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.640]   and some things that I don't like.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.520]   So I'm gonna do, I would put a cap on it too.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.580]   I'm gonna do a couple, I'm gonna do 10 minutes of research
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.920]   to make sure I'm not like going to some total dump, right?
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.120]   But then look, these things,
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.380]   they're basically gonna give me the same.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.220]   Every path is gonna be a mixture.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.280]   And when you see that, when you really get that,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.740]   all of a sudden the back and forth
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.820]   doesn't have the same urgency
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.760]   because ultimately it's all gonna be a basket
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.600]   of pleasure and pain.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.420]   You might say, no, no, no,
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.260]   but if I pick the right one,
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:49.020]   it'll have a higher percentage of pleasure over pain.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   And yes, maybe, but you generally don't have the data
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.460]   to know that it's in the future.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.460]   - Yeah, I almost think it's trying to avoid the pain
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.160]   of making the wrong choice
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.980]   than have the joy of making the right choice.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.540]   - Interesting, right?
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.780]   And how do you know it's the wrong choice?
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.300]   - Yeah, I mean, that's probably why it takes so long
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.060]   to make a decision 'cause there's no criteria to know that.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.620]   - I think the wrong choice would be
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.140]   you're in that future moment
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.860]   and something happens that's unpleasant.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.700]   - Yeah.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.980]   - And you say, ah, you see, I made the wrong choice.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:26.900]   And it's this fantasy world where if I chose the other one,
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.620]   I would have nothing unpleasant happen.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.220]   But then no matter where you go,
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.540]   you have unpleasant stuff happen.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.180]   And then it's like, I need to decide harder next time.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:42.220]   And so when you really embrace that mixture of stuff,
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.860]   it's so relaxing, it's so relieving, I think,
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.780]   'cause we're trying to avoid
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.180]   these inevitables of life through...
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.820]   And if you just, all it takes, I think,
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.100]   is just to observe that pattern from start to finish.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.860]   Okay, I'm maximizing on the hotel thing.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.100]   All right, let me just pick one.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.140]   And this is where bold action comes in.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.340]   So for the maximizing habit,
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.940]   the bold action is to set a cap
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.340]   and decide within whatever the decision is
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.180]   a reasonable amount of time.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.260]   So a trip or something like that, pretty quick, you know?
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.980]   It could be deciding on where we wanna go
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.220]   from just one conversation, one feeling.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.340]   Okay, let's do this, right?
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.980]   And then picking the accommodations,
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.340]   maybe you set aside an hour
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.940]   and just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 'em all out.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.060]   And you know, here's the funny thing.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.660]   Let's say you get someplace that really sucks.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.020]   So I was down in San Diego.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.420]   My wife was getting some medical thing done down there.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.700]   And we were there for, we said,
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.660]   "Oh, we'll spend a week down there at the same time."
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.900]   We get this Airbnb.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.940]   I pick the Airbnb.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.020]   Maybe similar to your, we should probably,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.980]   I do like no maximizing, which is a problem.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.580]   So we go there and to be fair,
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.860]   they had it listed as a beach view.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.620]   There was no beach view, so that was a misrepresentation.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.420]   But we get there and the place is just real tiny
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.660]   and cramped and dirty
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.980]   and some things that I could not have predicted.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.060]   And there was no view.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.060]   And it got real, real fast.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.420]   My first time at Airbnb experience
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.900]   where we messaged the person who was hosting
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.460]   and she got real like aggressive and crazy
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.460]   and just started saying these crazy threatening things.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.100]   So then I had to get Airbnb support involved.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.020]   And there's this illusion that Airbnb is like this company
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.220]   that's gonna like take care of you.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.980]   And it's just like some support dude in India
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.220]   who's like, "Let's see what I can do."
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.780]   Anyway, we ended up having to leave, like dramatically.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.220]   It was like, we had to get out
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.860]   within 15 minutes to not be charged.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.020]   And so we're hustling out of there.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.060]   She's sending these like threatening texts
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.540]   and then we leave.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.020]   And you might say, "Wow, what a terrible, bad experience."
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.620]   It ended up that we found another place
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.780]   that the guy was amazing and the spot was way better
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.540]   and it was cheaper.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.100]   And so I think that's a really helpful thing
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.340]   to remember as well is, but what if this happens?
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.900]   Well, what if that does happen?
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.060]   And then it leads to something extraordinary.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.620]   And you wouldn't get the extraordinary
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.580]   if that challenge didn't happen.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.220]   - It's funny 'cause my example of this
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.740]   is the exact same example, which is,
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.980]   when we went to London, we had this horrible Airbnb
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.700]   and the host, we had problems and we surfaced the problems
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.020]   and they told us we have to leave
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.700]   and we got Airbnb support,
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.380]   like literally the exact same thing.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.340]   And then Airbnb, where it deviated
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.900]   was Airbnb support was incredibly helpful
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.380]   and booked us a place that costs twice as much
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.420]   but didn't charge us any extra.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:29.140]   And we ended up staying at this ridiculously amazing place
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.580]   that I still think about because they had this kid's room,
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.260]   it was like a Harry Potter themed room with a train bed
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.140]   and a little tree reading nook
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.980]   and they turned the radiator into a castle, it was crazy.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.900]   But it was really awesome.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.380]   And that experience wouldn't have happened
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.100]   had we not picked the crappy Airbnb.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.300]   - Right?
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.260]   So what if you really internalize that and said,
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.780]   "Hey," it's like talking to yourself, you're like,
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:00.060]   "Hey, the unexpected, the problems
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.500]   can actually lead to extraordinary."
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.260]   And I think when we really get that,
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.100]   now we're talking about something that,
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.940]   if we were to go way back
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.060]   to the beginning of this conversation,
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.980]   how do you define confidence?
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.900]   Well, after I've been doing this for like 20 years now,
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.660]   I started my own self-confidence at age 20, I'm 40 now.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.460]   But there's like self, your confidence for yourself,
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.720]   I can handle whatever happens.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.620]   But I discovered that there's a cap on that.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.820]   Like how joyful and awesome our lives can be,
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.700]   there's a ceiling on self-confidence.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.080]   And to go higher into really thriving in life,
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.380]   I think we need to have confidence
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.260]   in something beyond ourselves,
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.740]   whatever you wanna put in that box, I don't care.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.620]   But that's the kind of belief that's tapped into that.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.700]   Hey, even out of the challenging experience,
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.580]   something extraordinary is gonna come.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.980]   And that's a beautiful example of that.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.740]   And you have that memory for the rest of your life, right?
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.180]   It's like a little reminder
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.260]   so that the next time you're sitting down
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.740]   to book something and you're like,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   just like, whoa, whoa, I'm maximizing.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:56.260]   I'm gonna give myself three minutes,
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.140]   pick a thing and who knows,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.460]   it's gonna lead to extraordinary.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.300]   - I love it.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.020]   I wanna come back, well, I've been thinking
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.900]   ever since we stopped talking about social freedom,
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.260]   there's something that's been resonating in my mind,
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.740]   which is all of these kind of social obligations
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.180]   that my wife and I always look at each other,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.340]   we're like, gosh, I don't wanna do that thing.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.820]   And she's like, yeah, I don't wanna do that thing.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.700]   But because this friend invited us this thing
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.260]   or this family member said we have to go to this thing
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.300]   and we kind of have to do it and we don't wanna do it.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.740]   It does that play in there?
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.380]   And is social freedom truly being able to tell your friend
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.500]   or your family member, it's like,
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.220]   hey, we don't actually wanna hang out with you.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.620]   So we're not gonna do like,
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.220]   I know you've written a book called "Not Nice".
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.340]   So like, how does this all come together
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.580]   in situations like this to be able to actually
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.180]   do the things we want with our lives
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.300]   and be happy and live our lives,
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.180]   but not make everyone around us think we're assholes?
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.420]   - Well, definitely tell them just like that.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.140]   I just don't wanna hang out with you, period, full stop.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:57.140]   No, I think, okay, there is really tuning in
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:00.020]   and asking yourself, what do I or in the case,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.540]   maybe you and your wife, what do we really want?
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.940]   Or maybe it's what do I want, what do you want?
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.660]   Let's really get clear on that.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.380]   And a lot of people don't even let themselves discover that
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.540]   because that's bad to not wanna go
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.580]   to your uncle's friends reunions thing, right?
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.980]   It's like, how bad of me, what a bad nephew and son I am.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.300]   So, but just in the safety of your own brain
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.500]   and maybe with your partner, it's like,
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.380]   hey, what do I really want?
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.220]   I don't wanna go to that thing.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.140]   You wanna go, I don't wanna go to that thing.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.820]   Okay, and just give space to that.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.340]   That sounds so simple, but most people don't.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.140]   And they're just an override, override.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.700]   Sometimes just airing it and hearing that part of you
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.580]   is like, ah, that feels good.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.340]   Then you actually have a choice there.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.140]   It's like the cold plunge.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.020]   I don't wanna go to the cold plunge,
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.020]   but I do because here's why.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:41.900]   And just tune in.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:44.180]   Is that true in this situation?
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.020]   So I don't, look, when it comes to going on a trip
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.780]   and so Christmas time,
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.580]   we go visit my wife's side of the family.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.140]   And I love her side of the family.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.180]   And when it's like travel and this and that,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.100]   it's like driving there and packing everything up
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.500]   and then staying in their place.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.420]   Some part of me is like, ah, there's a lot of work.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.820]   I don't know, just go without me.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.620]   I'll just stay home, that's fine.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.500]   But then I tune in.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.300]   I'm like, what do I, what do I?
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.060]   Yes, there's a part of me, it's like, it's easier,
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.820]   but what do I really want?
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.180]   And it's like, oh, I really want to be a part
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.380]   and connected with my wife, with family.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.540]   And so I'm gonna endure some of the discomforts
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.220]   because I ultimately do want,
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:26.300]   I value and prioritizing or optimizing
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.140]   for connection and deep relationships.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.300]   But that doesn't mean I go to everything
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.140]   and every function and every person's thing.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.820]   So we have to have that choice of like,
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.540]   what are the relationships
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.020]   that I want to really nourish and invest in?
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.220]   And it does involve saying no
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.980]   to a good percentage of things.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:50.260]   And doing so in a warm and loving way,
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.060]   thank you for letting me know.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.700]   I'm not gonna be able to make it to that.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.540]   You don't have to give a ton of reasons.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.140]   I got to take the kids to the dentist.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.020]   You know, it's like, no, I'm not, I'm not available.
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:58.980]   I'm not gonna be able to make that.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.100]   Thank you so much for thinking of me.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.620]   I hope you have a great time.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.020]   But do know that, you know, there are,
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.620]   there's a kind of a social currency
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.740]   that if you have a friend
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.060]   who's always inviting you to things
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.580]   and you always say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.900]   Then when you invite them,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.300]   they might not be a yes, right?
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.340]   Like there's a certain investment.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.220]   But the question is just
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.620]   where do you want to put that investment?
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.940]   And some friends you want to invest a lot with,
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.860]   some you're like, oh, I'll see him once in a while.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.060]   And some honestly, if it's mainly obligation,
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.860]   it's time to let it go.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:33.940]   - Yeah, I think sometimes it's,
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.220]   I've already let it go
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.340]   and there's people that just keep asking
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.340]   and you're like, what's the polite way to say,
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.260]   I don't want to go to this
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:44.500]   and feel free to not invite me ever again.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.980]   I haven't figured out the nice way to do that.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.220]   - Well, I think just a simple, like, thanks for the invite.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.900]   I'm, you know, I'm not available.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.540]   And just like, if you do that, I mean, first of all,
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.100]   I'd be at some point there that it'll extinguish,
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:55.940]   I'd imagine, right?
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.020]   It was just continually no.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.060]   At some point they'll be like, he's not available.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.100]   But I mean, you could, that's the next level
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.260]   that would be kind of like just being more direct and real.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.580]   And that's, hey, look,
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.660]   I always tell people life is a choose your own adventure.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.820]   You might say, I can't be that guy.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.460]   That's an asshole thing to do.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.460]   Well, I mean, just go back to what you said
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.300]   about being bold.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:17.620]   Like there are times where I think it took me a while
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.860]   to get the courage to tell people
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.460]   that I don't have time in my life to do a thing.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.380]   And I felt like I was being the asshole.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.060]   And especially with work obligations and responding emails.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.980]   And I was having a conversation
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.660]   or maybe I was preparing for a conversation
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.140]   with Derek Sivers, who had said, you know,
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.420]   I like to tell people I don't have time.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.380]   And when I got his email at one point where he was like,
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.940]   I might not respond to this.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.180]   There's a lot of stuff going on in my life.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.620]   And I'm really trying to focus on the things
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.460]   that are the most important.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.900]   And right now, you know,
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.260]   spending time with my kids is most important.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.500]   I was like, I'm not mad that you told me
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.700]   you can't reply to my email.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.340]   I'm actually jealous that you're like able to.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.580]   So it had this effect.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:58.620]   So maybe the answer to use the same set of habits here
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.540]   is you might think you're being an asshole by saying that,
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.740]   but maybe you're not.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.940]   Maybe it won't actually be interpreted in that way.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.540]   - Yes, you know, it sounds like he communicated
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.820]   with some vulnerability or transparency there, right?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.460]   Like he shared, it wasn't just like, fuck off.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.740]   I don't have time for you, right?
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.780]   It was like, you know, hey, this is what's going on for me.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.100]   And so that's a great way to do it.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.660]   It's like the sort of the technique
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.380]   or the communication style.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.220]   But here's the thing.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.740]   I think this is the biggest part of social freedom.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:30.020]   Are you an asshole or not is based upon,
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.620]   it's in the eye of the beholder.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.580]   So if you're bad in your mind, that's the biggest problem.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.620]   If you're not allowed, it goes against your,
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.340]   I call this your personal bill of rights.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.900]   You might not have a right to say,
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.580]   no, I'm not available for that.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.100]   You might not have a right to not respond to all the emails.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.540]   And as long as you don't have that right,
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.980]   'cause you haven't claimed it, you're gonna feel guilty.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.980]   You're gonna feel stressed.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.260]   You may even feel irritated at them.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.620]   How dare you ask me?
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.420]   'Cause it's now I feel guilty.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.140]   And if we have a right, like I have a right.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.180]   So in my personal bill of rights,
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.340]   I have a right to not respond to all emails.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.340]   Because in this day and age,
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.420]   if you feel pressure to reply to all your emails,
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.740]   like good God, that's...
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.380]   And the more emails you reply to, the more emails they are.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.900]   It's like they multiply.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.980]   And so I'm just, I'll reply to a lot of,
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.940]   some of the emails of my clients.
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.060]   I'll try to get back to a lot of them,
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.100]   but not everybody, not all the time.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.460]   And that's just...
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.340]   And so someone out there sometimes might think
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.900]   that Aziz guy, he's an asshole
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.900]   'cause he didn't do X for me.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.380]   And you know what?
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.300]   That's okay.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.780]   And if we're operating in life
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.420]   where no one must ever think that of me,
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.540]   then you're gonna be in a pretzel position
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.860]   faster than you can imagine.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:45.860]   And it's unsustainable and it's not you.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.580]   So really finding that permission
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.460]   to not do the things that you truly don't wanna do.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.580]   And then that's certainly bold action, by the way.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.820]   - Yeah, let's go back to this bill of rights
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.940]   because when I talked to Ramit Sethi about money,
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.620]   he has this Ramit's money rules.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.340]   And they just like really simplify
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.900]   his decision-making about things
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.020]   'cause he just took the uncertainty out of it.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.540]   So he says, "If someone is raising money for charity,
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.860]   I always give money.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.140]   If I fly for more than five hours or whatever the number is,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.420]   I always fly business class."
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.860]   And it just makes it super simple
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.300]   'cause he's thought about the decision abstractly
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.140]   from actually having to make it.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.820]   It's like, I always buy books.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.020]   Like if I wanna learn something
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.020]   and a book might have the answer, I always buy it.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.180]   I never stress out if it's $10 or $12 or 20,
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.220]   I just always buy it.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.140]   Talk about this bill of rights
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.340]   'cause it seems like something that I
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.100]   and maybe everyone listening would benefit from having.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.780]   - Yes, and we all have one.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.420]   It just, it might be a very short list of rights
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.180]   or it might be a long list of rights.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.420]   The more socially not free you are,
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.820]   the more you're in the cage,
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.460]   the shorter your bill of rights.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.580]   A bill of rights is just a statement of permissions.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.420]   I'm allowed to, I have a right to.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.540]   And you'll know what's in your bill of rights
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.900]   based on how you feel and what you do.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.740]   So do I have a right to say no
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.500]   to that person requesting I come to their thing?
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.900]   Well, did you say yes when you didn't wanna go?
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.740]   Then you might not have a right
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.780]   that says I get to say no to people's requests,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.300]   people's invitations.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.540]   You might have, and this gets,
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.100]   you might say, I have a right to repeatedly say no
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.780]   to someone's requests, right?
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.300]   That's a different thing.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.100]   And here's some core ones that I encourage people to adopt
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.940]   and make sure they have on their bill of rights, right?
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.660]   Like I have a right to ask for what I want.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.420]   I have a right to say no.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.300]   I have a right to approach anyone,
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.180]   whether that's virtually or in person.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.820]   Doesn't mean they wanna talk to you,
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.380]   but if you stop yourself
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:54.380]   before you even allow the opening or the approach,
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.580]   you're gonna limit your life significantly
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.700]   and people have all kinds of stories.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.740]   Oh, I'm gonna bother them.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.540]   Oh, hey, I don't know.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.380]   Maybe they'll be bothered.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.220]   Maybe they won't.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.260]   Let's find out.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.580]   In the case of the person wanting to hire you
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.540]   for your services, right?
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.380]   I have a right to ask for whatever fee I want
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.660]   for my services, whatever feels right.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.260]   And so the longer, and actually it's an exercise.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.500]   It's very much worth doing.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.660]   And I do it with clients,
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.140]   like have them sit down and like, well, write it out.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.340]   It doesn't have to be perfect.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.260]   What would feel empowering to you?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.140]   What as you write it,
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.420]   you're kind of nodding your head being like, yeah, all right.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.660]   And then just come up with a list of five, 10,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:36.380]   and this is your like a nation
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.300]   that has a bill of rights for its people.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.740]   This is your bill of rights for you.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.060]   And those must first be written
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.540]   and then they have to be practiced.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:47.580]   Otherwise, they're just flowery language on paper.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.740]   You're not actually doing them.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.220]   - Are there a few more examples you can give
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.500]   to inspire people as they're hopefully thinking
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.380]   about what would be on theirs?
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.940]   - Yeah, I mean, I think one thing to break it down
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.780]   is just think of the different areas of your life, right?
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.940]   So you think about in your relationship,
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   your romantic relationship, right?
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:08.540]   I have a right to tell my partner
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.120]   when something's bothering me.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.780]   And now it might sound real simple,
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.940]   but a lot of people shy away.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.900]   I don't wanna upset them.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.100]   I don't wanna bother them.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.740]   I have a right to, oh, here's a...
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.820]   This one I had to add to my bill of rights.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.060]   It's a doozy.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.040]   I have a right to disappoint people.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.780]   Particularly, I have a right to disappoint my partner.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.620]   - Let's talk about that, yeah.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.660]   - Well, that one was like,
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.580]   I would be running around in my whole life
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.060]   trying not to disappoint anybody.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.260]   I don't wanna have anyone be let down.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:42.540]   And look, it's great to be connected with your spouse
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.100]   and not just constantly not give a crap
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.860]   and disappoint them all over the place, sure.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:52.180]   But no matter how loving you're trying to be,
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.100]   how generous you're trying to be,
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.060]   if you're being authentic and true to what you really want,
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.100]   sometimes you're gonna disappoint them.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.060]   They want you to go to that thing and you don't wanna go.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.260]   They wanna have time to connect with you,
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.340]   but you are unavailable for whatever reason.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.340]   And so being able to say no
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:16.380]   and then withstand that discomfort
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.140]   of someone is disappointed in me.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.820]   And the reason I created that bill of right for myself
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.860]   is 'cause I lived with this kind of
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.740]   chronic background anxiety
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.580]   that someone somewhere was gonna be disappointed with me.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.700]   And so just to be like, yeah, I have a right.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.060]   Sometimes people are disappointed with me
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.380]   and I have a right to do that sometimes.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.940]   And really resting on that, that's what it feels like.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.260]   It feels like you can rest on your bill of rights
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.300]   and like all is well.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.860]   Like I'm allowed to do that.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.140]   And it's almost like teaching a child,
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.620]   like, hey, you're allowed to do this,
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.940]   but we kind of have to do that for our own selves now.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.140]   So you can look at that relationship life,
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.780]   look at inside of your career and your work.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.500]   What are you unique to your thing?
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.140]   I have a right to ask a question in a meeting.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.860]   I have a right to disagree with somebody.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.900]   That's a big one.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.660]   And you can think about it socially too, right?
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.180]   Like this is a great one.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.020]   I have a right to change the subject of a conversation.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.940]   'Cause nice people can get trapped on the rails, right?
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.300]   Oh, we're talking about their thing.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.140]   I don't want to talk.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:13.980]   How do I get out of this?
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.020]   And then they pause for a minute.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.260]   And because you don't have a right to change a subject,
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.940]   instead of changing the subject, you say,
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.540]   hmm, tell me more.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.140]   And then the conversation keeps going and you're trapped,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:25.980]   right?
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.820]   I lived in that one for a long time.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   So I have a right to change the subject.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:28.780]   Ooh, here's a good one.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.740]   I have a right to interrupt people, right?
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.980]   'Cause sometimes you're talking to someone
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.100]   and they're going on and on and on.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.500]   And you say, hey, I want to ask you something.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.540]   That's a great technique for interrupting, by the way.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.980]   As if it just came to you.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.340]   Hey, right in the middle of their sentence.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.180]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.500]   Hey, I just thought of something.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.660]   I wanted to ask you something.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.540]   And then boom, you can steer it a new direction.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.820]   - Yeah, wow.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.660]   So many things.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:51.860]   Okay, you mentioned last thing.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.580]   You talked about relationships.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.420]   You have kids.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.380]   I have younger kids.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.860]   I feel like what I've taken away from this
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.980]   is that there's virtually no reason
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.100]   that confidence wouldn't be a skill to improve for anyone.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.700]   How, as parents, should we think about this
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.060]   and helping our kids have confidence?
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.900]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.460]   I'd say the biggest transmission to children,
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.740]   hands bar none, is modeling.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:23.180]   They're going to observe you all the time.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.940]   They're gonna replicate your style of speaking,
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:30.300]   your belief systems, your attitudes toward the world.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.020]   Later on, they'll rebel and they'll adopt their new,
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.740]   you know, they'll kind of create their own views.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.980]   But as young, they're gonna really model you.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.980]   And so show them is much bigger than telling them.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.420]   So you might say, ah, just go out there and do it.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.580]   What are you afraid of?
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.260]   There's no monsters in your room.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.380]   Come on.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.060]   But are you boldly approaching the things in your life?
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.740]   You might say, well, they don't see me at work.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.260]   Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.900]   They just, they pick up on you
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.140]   and your essence in the world.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.980]   So practice these things yourself.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.300]   And then I love to look for little opportunities
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.700]   to like teach them through games and practice.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.700]   So down our, we live out in the country and down our road,
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.580]   there's this like a big plot of land that was clear cut.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.460]   And there's a trail that goes through it.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.940]   And it ends at this creek and then the trail continues,
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.820]   but you have to jaunt onto someone's property briefly
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.100]   for the trail, and then you go back onto the trail.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.700]   And every time I go down there, I'm like,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.180]   I wonder where that trail goes.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.140]   But you know, just going on people's land
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.060]   randomly out here, nah, not that, you know,
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.500]   I don't know if that's one of the social freedoms
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.380]   I wanna break, right?
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:41.300]   So I'm like, I'm there with my son and he's seven.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.740]   And I'm like, you know, let's go to the guy's house
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.420]   and ask him if we can just walk on the edge of his property
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.020]   and keep going on the trail.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:52.020]   And my seven year old's like, no, I don't wanna,
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.620]   I'm scared, right?
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.300]   And so here's what I do, and this is intentional.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.900]   We're walking side by side on our way
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.700]   to where we would ask the guy and I hold his hand.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.260]   So I'm transmitting a message of like safety,
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.460]   like we're okay, we're together.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.500]   And that's what we would do with the part inside of us
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.820]   before the action that's like, ah, I'm freaking out.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.380]   You like, you don't tell yourself like,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.660]   stop being a coward, you suck, right?
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.540]   No, we're treating yourself like someone you love,
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.420]   almost on my own side.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:22.380]   And so I grab his hand and I'm like, oh, are you afraid?
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.580]   And he's like, yeah.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.740]   And then this really struck me.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.940]   He's like, wait, isn't this what you do for work, dad?
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.700]   Help people that are afraid.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.980]   And I was like, as a matter of fact, it is what I do.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.620]   So here's what we do.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.180]   How about we ask them?
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.700]   And the worst that he could say is no.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.340]   So I'm just modeling for him to bold action.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.580]   Then I let him change the level of weight, right?
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.980]   So he gets, starts getting more scary.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.060]   He's like, I don't wanna ask.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.620]   I was like, well, how about I go to the front door
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.460]   and you just stay back and you can watch me,
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.020]   but you don't have to be there.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.380]   And he's like, okay.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.420]   So I titrated it for him as opposed to like forcing him.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.460]   'Cause if you try to force them
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.900]   to do what they're scared of,
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.940]   that doesn't build the confidence, right?
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.580]   'Cause they're not taking the efficacy.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.100]   So I let him hang back, but modeling, watch me.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.500]   So I knock on this guy's door, this old man opens the door.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.740]   He's like, it's already going bad.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:18.220]   When he opens the door, he's like, can I help you?
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   And I was like, well, just on the edge of the trail,
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.060]   can we go to the land?
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.100]   And he's like, no, that's our land back there too.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.580]   We like to keep it private.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.220]   And then I said, okay,
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.380]   but even if we just go right along the edge,
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   would that be okay?
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.060]   And he's like, no, we wanna keep it private.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.220]   I was like, all right, that's fine.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.940]   And then, so we walk away and we're walking back
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.740]   and my seven-year-old's like, why did you ask him again?
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.380]   And I said, you always wanna ask twice,
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.700]   just in case you miss something,
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.020]   maybe you could offer a new idea.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.060]   And he said, he's like, but he said no twice.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.380]   And I was like, yeah, well, that's what happens.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.420]   But if you get a no, you can always ask one more time
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.180]   'cause maybe they'll change their mind.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.460]   And so that's a little bit of like teaching and modeling.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.060]   And look, I'm playing a long game on this.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.300]   This doesn't mean tomorrow he goes and applies all this,
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.700]   you know, but I have space and he's shy.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.860]   Both of them are, especially him, is a little new people
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:18.060]   and I don't push him like, you gotta do it.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.700]   It's more just like creating this spacious,
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:25.220]   really long game modeling and knowing that over time,
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.460]   he'll find his confidence and highlighting his strength.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.580]   And then one last thing I'll say,
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.900]   which I mean, maybe you do this as a,
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.420]   yours are kind of young, so they might not,
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.940]   this language might not mean a lot to them,
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.300]   but my kids age seven and nine,
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.080]   just telling them that you're proud of them,
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.100]   but not only when they like score the goal and get the A,
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.260]   but just like, we're sitting there, we're eating breakfast
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.580]   and I just put my arm around one of them and was like,
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.900]   hey, I love you, I'm proud of you.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.220]   And I don't have to explain why.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.540]   And you just see them, they're just like their top button,
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.140]   like, hmm, you know, they feel 10 feet tall.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.460]   And why am I doing that?
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:08.740]   Because we just have this negative toxic critic
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.560]   in most of us where it's not,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.360]   maybe it's not tearing you down to the bottom of confidence,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.760]   but it's like, it's doing a little bit
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.280]   of who do you think you are?
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.540]   You haven't done enough yet.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.980]   And just letting them know that they can feel proud
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.940]   of themselves without even achieving,
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.740]   going to the moon or not,
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.100]   can really build this core sense of,
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.780]   I'm on my own side and I'm worthy.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.460]   - I love it.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.500]   Yeah, I mean, one year old's not really learning
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.100]   a lot of these lessons, but at three,
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.140]   I think there's a, she was trying to climb this ladder
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.380]   at this birthday party.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.660]   And I think I probably, I have a different approach
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.980]   to how I might've taken that now
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.420]   than trying to tell her she could do it,
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.860]   even I knew she could do it, but she didn't.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.700]   And I have some new ideas that I'll take care of.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.100]   - One thing is like, oh, you want me to hold your hand
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:56.940]   while you do it?
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.700]   Like you kind of find the, like,
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.740]   is there any way that I could be an aid
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.180]   in getting you to do it?
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.400]   - That's what we do on the slide.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.700]   When there were some steep slides,
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.540]   she was like, I don't want to do it.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.360]   I was like, do you want to hold hands?
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.740]   No, do you want me to come up and go with you?
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.580]   Yeah, like just giving various alternatives.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.140]   - Did you find one that clicked?
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.380]   - Yes.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.780]   And now she's like, I don't want your hand.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.140]   Now she doesn't want my hand.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:16.980]   - There you go.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.020]   Make sure that if you encourage them to do the thing though,
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:22.340]   and they don't, that you yell shame at them
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:23.260]   until they're crying.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.140]   That's the, no, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.420]   And one last thing I'll say for your kids age one and three
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.260]   and anyone you're listening,
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.180]   I mean, even at this age, seven and nine that I have,
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.340]   but one and three, man,
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.580]   I just think give yourself a lot of credit.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.460]   I mean, you're spending time with them.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:41.360]   You're being on the playground with the slide.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.580]   I mean, I remember when my kids were that year,
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.540]   part of me loved it and part of me was like,
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.020]   this day is going on forever.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.060]   I'm so bored, you know?
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.300]   And just like giving space for that
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.180]   and knowing that at that age,
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.620]   the most powerful transmission you can do
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:00.500]   is I see you and you matter.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.860]   And you're not saying that a thousand times a day,
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.000]   but just your energy, your attention on them.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.340]   And I know in this day and age
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.500]   where we're all overstimulated and stressed and this,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.660]   but just like slowing down,
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.580]   it doesn't mean 24/7, but just, you know,
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.180]   you're there a certain amount of hours every day.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.340]   Just like, hey, I see you, I'm with you.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.380]   It sets this foundation also of like,
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.980]   I'm worthy of attention.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.940]   And I think that's really healthy too for confidence.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.180]   - I have a lot of things.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.660]   I didn't necessarily feel unconfident coming into this,
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.660]   but I still want to go and work on a lot of this
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.420]   and kind of level it up.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.860]   So thank you so much.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:35.300]   Where can people go get more from you if they're interested?
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.300]   - Just go to my website, draziz.com.

[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.100]   And again, this, you don't have to be in the gutter.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.260]   As Chris is pointing out, right, this is about optimizing.
