[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   In today's world where we have Apple Pay, we have Google Pay, Samsung Pay, you can add your partner's cards to your phone and use them anywhere.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.880]   You have one password where you can share the credit card information with your partner.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.760]   You don't really actually need a physical card in most circumstances.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.680]   And in a lot of the circumstances where you might and the dollar amount values matters,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.720]   it's probably fine to just bring your partner's card and use it.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.280]   And most of the time, no one's really checking.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.080]   The need to actually create an authorized user card for another person really doesn't happen that much.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.840]   On the off chance that there is a regular recurring high value type of transaction or merchant you shop at, maybe it makes sense.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   But one thing to keep in mind is that when you add someone as an authorized user, that card will show up on their credit report.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.720]   And so for banks that have issues like 5/24, where you can't have opened five cards in the last 24 months to get approved,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.120]   that authorized user card will count as one of those cards.
