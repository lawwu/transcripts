[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.940]   - Today on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.720]   where should I keep my emergency fund?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:38.500]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.260]   the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.820]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.660]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.140]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.220]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.860]   An emergency fund is certainly a cornerstone
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.340]   of a good financial plan.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.820]   Emergency fund allows you to withstand the storms of life,
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300]   both literal and metaphorical,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.360]   and is really one of the first places to start,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.780]   but where should you put it?
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.180]   I was inspired to do this show by a question
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.620]   in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.640]   this last week, where somebody in that group
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.900]   was asking their fellow group members,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.340]   where should I keep my emergency fund?
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.420]   And there was discussion of certain banks
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.180]   and online banks, and most of the focus of the discussion
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660]   was on interest rates and where to get
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.700]   the highest rate of return on money.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.180]   And I was struck by the fact,
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.500]   and to those of you engaged in the conversation,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000]   this is not intended to be personally offensive to you,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.980]   but I was just struck by the fact
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.260]   that nobody was talking about other considerations
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.060]   other than rate of return on money.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.060]   And I think that with regard to emergency stashes of cash,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.420]   interest rate, rate of return,
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.140]   is although not unimportant,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.260]   it is perhaps the least important
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.300]   of the factors that you should consider.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.120]   And today I'll share with you some of these other factors
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.260]   that I think bear your attention
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.660]   or should have your attention,
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.460]   as well as my thoughts on a diversity of options
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.580]   for where you should keep your emergency fund.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.500]   Now, I'm gonna split today's show into two shows,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.580]   meaning the same file that you're listening to now,
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   but two different shows.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.860]   There's gonna be part A, which is the intro level,
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.500]   which is applicable for the vast majority of listeners.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.080]   And then there is the weird in-depth analysis level,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.480]   which is applicable for a minority of listeners.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.620]   I often have a habit of getting so deep into a subject
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460]   that sometimes all of the advice makes sense in my head.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.020]   It's a little convoluted for actual practical application.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.900]   And I don't wanna do that because this show is too important
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600]   and this topic is too important.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.660]   So let's start part A right here and right now.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.860]   The majority of people in the United States of America,
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.260]   and I dare say throughout the world,
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.980]   although I have no current data on a global basis,
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.840]   but the majority of people in the United States of America
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   cannot come up with $1,000 cash right now if necessary.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.400]   Majority of people, if faced with a $1,000 emergency,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.600]   would rely upon a credit card
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.640]   or a loan from a family member or friend.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   This is a problem in our society
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.580]   because when our society is living so close to the edge,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.800]   financially, as a majority of us are,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.480]   it causes us to feel a significant amount of fear
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   and it causes most of our thinking to be short-term
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   rather than longer-term.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.520]   It's hard to think long-term if you don't have enough money
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.800]   to cover a blown-out tire this month.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.180]   And so my advice here in part A of the show is very simple.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.140]   If you do not have an emergency fund,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.000]   you should do only two things.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.020]   Number one, you should scrimp, scrap,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.020]   and do whatever you need to do to save $1,000
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.160]   in cash, and by cash here, I mean currency.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.920]   I mean dollar bills, $20 bills,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.040]   and you should stash that $1,000 in a safe place
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   that you can have access to when necessary.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.180]   If your living condition is stable
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.600]   and you find yourself in a place
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.160]   where you have your own living space,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.640]   then perhaps your solution here is fairly simple.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.320]   You might have a locking file cabinet
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.480]   or stash it in a small lockbox
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.400]   or maybe perhaps in a private bag
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.200]   that you put in some corner of your dresser.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.580]   You probably don't need to go too extreme
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.480]   in hiding $1,000.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.240]   If your living condition is less stable,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.500]   you might need to be more thoughtful
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.660]   in how you approach this.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.460]   If you are one of the millions of people
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.560]   who live in fear of your things being rifled through
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.380]   by your roommates or by your family members,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.160]   then you need to be intelligent
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.220]   about where you stash your cash.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.600]   Stash, funny.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.800]   Makes me think, where do you stash your stash?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.440]   Maybe you should find out where other people
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.320]   stash their stash and stash your cash in that same location.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.760]   But putting a couple hundred dollars
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.580]   in the back of a favorite book is probably not a bad idea.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.740]   Maybe put a little bit in your sock drawer,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.420]   melt a carton of ice cream and put it in a plastic bag
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.240]   and stick it down at the bottom of our ice cream,
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.360]   something like that.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.980]   Find some places to stick it around your house.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.240]   But keep the cash close by
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.000]   because when you need to lay your hand on money,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.060]   you need to lay your hand on money.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   And $1,000 will get you out of a large number of problems.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.120]   It'll get you out of a flat tire.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.900]   It'll get you out of a small car repair.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.200]   It'll get you out of running out of money
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.280]   and not having enough money for groceries this week.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.480]   It'll get you out of a lot of problems,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.240]   but it needs to be accessible to you.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.700]   So 1,000 bucks should be hidden and secured
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.640]   in the form of currency, $20 bills,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.280]   somewhere nearby where you can get quick access to it.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.300]   Once you have that, you're saving up for a little bit more.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.380]   Anything up to, you know, say 10 grand
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.960]   should just be kept in a savings account
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.440]   at your current bank,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.900]   at your bank where you currently bank.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.720]   Put it in a savings account.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.800]   Ideally, that savings account should have
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.720]   access to your checking account
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.800]   where you can do an instantaneous transfer
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.880]   into your checking account
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.200]   and have as close to instantaneous access
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.560]   to the money as possible.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.400]   So if your emergency fund is anything in that amount,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   anywhere, and I'm making these numbers up,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.140]   so if you think the number should be $7,000, that's fine.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.360]   But anywhere from zero to $10,000,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.640]   that's what you should do.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.320]   Doesn't need to be complicated.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.240]   Doesn't need to be anything more than that.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.360]   Just keep something like 1,000 bucks close at hand
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.760]   and up to 10 grand just in a savings account
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.080]   connected to your checking account.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.580]   This is part A of the show.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.480]   But now we need to do part B
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   because if we stop there,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.840]   I will not adequately serve the majority of listeners,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.560]   nor would I even adequately serve the majority of people
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.000]   in any of our towns that we all live in
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.040]   because almost no one except the very young
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   should have only $10,000 in their emergency fund.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.000]   Almost no one except the very young,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.320]   perhaps a teenage low-wage earner
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   should have only $10,000 in an emergency fund.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.480]   I say that clearly hearing
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.760]   the perhaps sense of tone deafness
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.680]   that that would, the way that might come across.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.920]   In a world where majority of our population
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.400]   can't lay their hands on $1,000 cash,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.080]   to say that almost no one should have only $10,000
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.040]   in an emergency fund can sound a little silly.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.840]   But here's why I say that.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.680]   It's true.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.800]   Almost no one except the very young, low-wage earner
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.320]   should have only $10,000 in an emergency fund.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.680]   When I was going through my certified financial planner
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.840]   education years ago,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.240]   they talked about the size of an emergency fund.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   And the CFP board would actually test on this
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.460]   on the CFP exam.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.880]   And they gave criteria for defining how much
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.040]   of an emergency fund each family should have.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.520]   And the way they approach it,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.960]   I think made a lot of sense.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.000]   They always recommend either three
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.960]   or six months worth of expenses.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.360]   And as a financial planner,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.200]   you're supposed to recommend to your clients
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   that they save either three or six months worth of expenses.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.160]   In order to determine whether the three months
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.240]   or six months is appropriate,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.040]   look at the income flows for the household.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.080]   Put simply, if you have a single income earner
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.120]   in the household, you go with six months.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   If you have two income earners in a household,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.440]   you might go with three months.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   Now this makes sense.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.520]   If you are a dual income family
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.400]   and one of you loses your job,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.040]   well, you don't lose all your income.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.000]   You lose some portion of your income.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.280]   If there's a dramatic imbalance in the incomes
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.600]   of the two members of the household,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.480]   then you should adjust accordingly
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.120]   in terms of how much of an emergency fund.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.520]   But the only people that should have
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.680]   only three months of expenses
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.080]   are people who have dual income households
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.740]   according to the CFP board.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.160]   So let's say that I have a client who's a single person
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.200]   and this client is earning $10 an hour.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.520]   Well, $10 an hour times, let's just say a 40 hour work week
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   is a total of $400 per week.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.380]   Let's assume their expenses wind up being
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.640]   about $400 per week.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.360]   This client as a single individual
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.960]   should have a six month emergency fund.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   $400 a week times 26 weeks would equal $10,400.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   That's how I get to that number, $10,400.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.560]   But a normal person earning a median
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   or above median wage, not a low wage earner,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.840]   should have far in excess of that.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.920]   Now, of course, I'm speaking in terms
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.940]   of both income and expenses.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.120]   You should customize this to your expenses if you want to.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.760]   If you know your actual expenses,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.540]   just work with that number.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.800]   But of course, most people spend most of their money
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.240]   so we can safely work with income.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.400]   So let's talk about median wage earner
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.000]   of say $4,000 per month,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   who is spending about $4,000 a month.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.880]   That means that an average emergency fund
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.800]   for a median wage earner,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.240]   median meaning 50% of the population,
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.480]   higher 50% lower, is about $24,000.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.320]   And you as a listener
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.000]   of the Radical Personal Finance podcast
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.740]   are statistically much likely to be far above
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.480]   a median wage earner than the general population.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.780]   So a minimum emergency fund for most of us
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.960]   should be in excess of $25,000.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.720]   And now you start to have to ask harder questions.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.320]   Where do I keep $25,000?
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.000]   Where do I keep $50,000?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.860]   Where do I keep $100,000?
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.200]   Where do I keep this large amounts of money?
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.000]   And so now let's start part B of the show.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.080]   If you have or should have an emergency fund
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.180]   of higher than $10,000,
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.960]   let me give you some ideas on some considerations,
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   some things you should think about.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.280]   The place to start with emergency fund planning
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.240]   is with imagining a scenario,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.740]   an emergency that you would be likely to face.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.220]   These scenarios will vary
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.420]   depending on your life circumstances, and they should.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.400]   Now, obviously we may all have some common scenarios.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.200]   Perhaps the most common would be the loss of a job.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.320]   This is certainly the scenario
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.040]   that most people would start with.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.200]   And I think it's a good place to start.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.160]   I've lost jobs.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.280]   I think we've all lost jobs.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.680]   If you haven't, and if you're a worker in a job scenario,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.400]   you're just a matter of time.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.120]   If you're not a worker in a job scenario,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.840]   it's just a matter of time until you lose clients
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.780]   and you lose business.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.940]   That's life, that's business.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.720]   The loss of a job can be a devastating thing
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   for many families.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.420]   And so many times people are considering that.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.280]   Well, it's not that hard to plan for the loss of a job
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.300]   in the financial sense.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.060]   Money in a bank account spends
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.800]   whether you have a job or not.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.720]   So if you keep the money in a savings account
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.280]   that you can get into the bank account, then it spends.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.800]   That's a different emergency
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.800]   than Aunt Sally dying unexpectedly,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   and you're needing to buy five last minute plane tickets
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.120]   across the country to go to her funeral.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.000]   Many of us have or will experience that.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.240]   Now, what's different about it?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   Well, I would focus on the fact
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.360]   that there's a difference in the speed of cash needed
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.960]   and the amount of money needed.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.640]   When you lose a job, you don't all of a sudden incur
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.000]   $10,000 worth of expenses in one day.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.700]   What happens is you have your normal mortgage payment,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.640]   your normal food costs, et cetera, that can continue on.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.600]   When you have a sharp emergency
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.320]   like flying your family across the country
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.000]   to go to Aunt Sally's funeral,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.320]   you have a significant unexpected expense all of a sudden.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.680]   And so you need to come up with the $10,000
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.580]   all of a sudden.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.580]   So one of the factors of emergency fund planning
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.780]   needs to be access, the speed of access.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.520]   How quickly can I get my hands on the money?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.180]   Especially how quickly can I get my hands
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.280]   on large amounts of money?
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.180]   As you think about your emergency fund,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.700]   you should consider some different scenarios
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.700]   that you are concerned about, that you're planning for,
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.580]   and think about how important it is
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.700]   to be able to get your hands on large amounts of money.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.180]   Here would be a good follow-up question.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.180]   How quickly do you need to get access to the money
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.060]   and in what form do you need to get access to the money?
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.180]   Should you be able to have access to the money
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.260]   in a digital form or in a physical form?
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.460]   Just a moment ago, I talked about buying plane tickets
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.780]   to go and see Aunt Sally.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.980]   In that emergency, you need digital money.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.480]   Can't walk into the airplane counter
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.900]   in the United States of America
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.900]   and plunk down $10,000 in $20 bills on the counter.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:28.780]   You will be immediately flagged as a suspicious person,
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.860]   most likely a drug dealer,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.540]   or also very likely a terrorist,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.860]   perhaps a stupid terrorist.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.340]   They will not laud you for your effective financial planning
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.420]   and for eschewing the use of debt and credit cards.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.620]   The airline representatives, if they take the money,
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.900]   will file a suspicious activity report with the IRS
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.940]   because there's a cash transaction
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.380]   in excess of a few thousand dollars.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.020]   Depends usually, any time you get near $10,000
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.940]   as a hard line, you break that.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.260]   Depends on other transactions.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.860]   Post Office has a, I think it's a $3,000 or $4,000 limit
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.100]   on cash transactions.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.940]   Other places, it's $10,000.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.080]   Or if you just simply do something that's suspicious,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.620]   like using cash, you are now a suspicious person.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.020]   And so you'll be doubly violated at the security lines,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.220]   probably get called into the back room
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.520]   for a little bit extra questioning, et cetera.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.340]   Don't use cash to buy a plane ticket.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.340]   Not gonna work, bad idea.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.540]   But what about our caller to the most recent Friday Q&A
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.540]   who was planning to move abroad to a country in Asia
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.620]   where he said he didn't wanna purchase property
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.340]   in that country or own property in that country
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.580]   because he might be kicked out of the country.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.660]   What about that guy?
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.040]   What about his potential emergency flight
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.880]   out of the country?
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.860]   If I were in that situation, you can bet your dollar,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.580]   you can bet a few of 'em pretty safely,
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.740]   that I would make sure that I had large amounts of currency
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.760]   readily at hand in order to buy my way out of that country
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.500]   if I became a disgraced person, a persona non grata.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.820]   This happens every day all around the world.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.980]   Within the last year, I have had significant,
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.020]   close interaction with three friends of mine
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.180]   from three different regions of the world,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.260]   all of whom have faced similar interactions.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.820]   One, a Venezuelan refugee trying to get out of Venezuela
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.820]   before the nightmare that is going on there.
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.220]   Another, a Filipino refugee.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.540]   It wasn't a broader, the Venezuelan was a broader
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.020]   economic crisis which has now resulted in currently
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.460]   the highest inflation in the world.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.180]   Really dramatic to watch it.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:57.180]   I watch it with a mixture of absolute horror
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   at the human suffering and the human cost
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.740]   of the lives of the men and women and children
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.860]   caught in the grip of the crisis there in Venezuela.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.380]   And with another, I don't know if it's horror
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380]   or satisfaction at watching the absolutely predictable
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.460]   result of socialism in that particular context.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.460]   I was, it's particularly poignant to me
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.020]   because in college I studied under a group of professors
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.580]   who were extreme leftists and who held up
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.380]   in their instruction to me as a college student,
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.300]   Hugo Chavez and his work in Venezuela,
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.160]   both Hugo Chavez and also the Castro regime in Cuba,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.340]   as model examples of what can be done to care for people
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.380]   when we actually care about people.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.620]   And I haven't contacted them recently
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.680]   to find out what they said,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.740]   but I continue to do my homework on that subject.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.540]   Point is, when you got to get out of Venezuela,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.060]   you may or may not be allowed to go.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.220]   And so you may or may not need to get
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.140]   that midnight flight out, the midnight boat out.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.300]   Similar circumstance with a friend of mine
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   in the Philippines.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.980]   Ran a successful business on an island in the Philippines.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.540]   In that island in the southern part of the Philippines,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.540]   in that town, there was an attack by the local expression
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.340]   of Muslim terrorists where they massacred
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.860]   about 40 to 50 people there in that town.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.820]   Fundamentally destroyed the economy
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.860]   and he and his family basically fled
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.700]   in the middle of the night,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.260]   just like you read in a fiction book.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.380]   And then final example was a friend of mine from Nigeria
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   who faced the confiscation of his house
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.780]   by the local governing authorities
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.700]   because of his noncompliance with the local code.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.220]   Basically like a homeowners,
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.820]   our version of a homeowners,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.960]   their version of a homeowners association.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.020]   But there had been a strong storm
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.300]   that had destroyed part of the house.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.780]   He didn't have the money to fix it.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.980]   But because he fixed it, then after a period of time,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.820]   this didn't happen immediately,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.060]   but because he didn't fix it and he couldn't fix it,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.260]   he didn't have the money, after a period of time,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.140]   then his property was lined up to be confiscated
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.980]   by the local government because it was not safe to live in.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.940]   Just crazy.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.440]   Same thing that we face here
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.340]   when a homeowners association says to you
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.780]   that you can't park your work truck here,
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.940]   you can't let your grass grow,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.220]   and then they start to foreclose on you
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.380]   and they can kick you out.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.560]   Exactly the same thing, except different standards.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.780]   It wasn't the grass was too long,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.420]   it was that the back part of the house
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.840]   had been damaged in a windstorm
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.380]   and he hadn't been able to fix it yet.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.240]   And it wasn't just a homeowners association,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.700]   it was the official city government.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.980]   So my point in sharing these examples
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.440]   is to say these are personal examples.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.340]   All of those events have occurred,
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.380]   not all of those events have occurred in the last year,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.660]   but all of those events have occurred
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.500]   within the last decade.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.460]   I'm intentionally being a little bit vague on details
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.060]   to protect my friends.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.460]   It's not the stuff of paranoia,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.680]   it's the stuff of reality
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.580]   that a lot of people all around the world face.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.340]   In all three of those stories,
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.920]   all three of those examples,
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.300]   those people had emergencies
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.420]   and they needed funds to get them out of the emergencies.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.940]   And all three of them, the answer was the same,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.100]   plane ticket, boat ticket, et cetera, out of the problem.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.420]   So when you're planning your emergency,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.700]   you need to think carefully
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.780]   about what's likely to affect you.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.940]   I don't personally spend a whole lot of time
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.940]   worrying about needing to flee South Florida
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.640]   because the local government is going to take my house.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.060]   And in most of these situations, there is time.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.000]   There's time that you can get the cash together
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.420]   if that's what you need to do.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.720]   There's time when the storm happens
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.340]   and you know you're starting to have confrontation
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.500]   with the local government, et cetera.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.420]   You get the point, there's time.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.860]   But when you come up with a scenario
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   for which you might need quick access to money,
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.540]   you need to think about the speed of access.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.100]   How quickly can you get access to large amounts of money?
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.580]   And in what form can you get access?
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.260]   Practically speaking, hurricane planning.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.620]   We're just coming off the back end
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.580]   of Hurricane Irma here in Florida.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.380]   During hurricanes, a few things usually happen.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.180]   Number one, you usually need to purchase
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.180]   some level of supplies and preparation for a storm.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.700]   And most of the time, everything is fine before the storm.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.980]   You can do that all with digital money.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.140]   But after the storm is where things change.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.420]   Things have gotten better where more stores
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.860]   are prepared to do business electronically.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.900]   But not all stores are, after a storm I mean.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.980]   Not everybody has power.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.220]   In an absence of power,
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.540]   or in the absence of an internet connection,
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.140]   many stores cannot run their digital transactions.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.140]   So last week, we were across the state with my family,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.060]   coming on personal reasons, came back across the state,
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.500]   and as I was passing through central Florida,
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.060]   stopped to get gas, pulled into the gas station, cash only.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.180]   I asked why.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.080]   Well, their internet connection was down.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.620]   'Cause the internet connection was down,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.980]   none of the credit card pumps worked,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.980]   none of the credit card authorizations inside worked,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.140]   and they were only accepting cash.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.020]   That happens after every single hurricane,
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.940]   again and again and again.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.740]   Happens after a blackout, et cetera,
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.160]   again and again and again.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.560]   So if a hurricane is predicted for your area,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.340]   and you're looking around and saying,
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.980]   "Okay, I should probably have some cash on hand."
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.500]   Then what do you do?
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.940]   You go to the ATM, put your card in there,
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.140]   and you say, "I'm gonna get some cash out."
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.040]   Well, that's good.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.420]   But you quickly hit your ATM and bank limits,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.760]   which for most of us are about 500 bucks.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   You may be able to get a couple transactions,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.320]   but I don't know if you've ever tried to get $5,000
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.480]   out of an ATM in one day,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.940]   but unless you've made special provisions to do that,
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.720]   it usually doesn't work.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.180]   Your bank will shut you down.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.120]   If you are leading a family of multiple people,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.800]   multiple children,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.520]   $500 doesn't go very far after an emergency situation.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.560]   Doesn't buy a whole lot of nights in a hotel room
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.040]   when they can't run your credit card.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.700]   It's probably enough to get you out of the acute area.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.920]   But what if you're on a Caribbean island,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.900]   and you're a tourist on St. Martin,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.760]   when Hurricane Irma roars through,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.060]   and you can't get off the island before the storm,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.480]   and so you wind up going through the storm,
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.440]   and now 70% of your infrastructure is destroyed.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.680]   Now how do you get off the island?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.020]   Now how do you get food?
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:56.600]   Are you prepared for that as a refugee in Hurricane Irma?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.440]   Just look in the news,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   and you see this happening every single day.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.840]   So you should think seriously about access,
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.680]   speed of access,
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.280]   and how quickly you can get access to appropriate amounts
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.100]   or even large amounts of cash.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.600]   Number two, though, of ask access,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.200]   you need to think about how to restrict access
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.600]   so that your money is not spent.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.880]   I believe there's a useful and valid principle
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   that can be applied and should be applied to money,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.520]   at least for me.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.280]   I've learned that it's probably often a good idea
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.600]   to keep a little bit of distance
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.560]   and a little bit of friction between me and my money.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.400]   I don't want too much distance and too much friction,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.100]   'cause obviously I need to have access,
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.200]   but a little bit of distance and a little bit of friction
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.280]   is probably a good idea.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.760]   Now, this was more important for me when I was younger,
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.440]   and I was more prone to emotional decisions
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.900]   rather than more thoughtful decisions,
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.600]   but it's changed as I've gotten older,
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.360]   but still probably a good idea
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.280]   to have a little distance between you and your money.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.000]   Practically speaking,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.240]   a little distance would involve
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.840]   keeping it at a separate account.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.520]   Millions of people all over the world
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.900]   are affected by identity theft each and every day.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.060]   This can come down to your checking account being raided.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.500]   I've experienced it, you probably have.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   According to the data breach this last week,
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.100]   which I will try to do a show on,
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.860]   angers me deeply,
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.300]   where Equifax has released the data of,
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.500]   I think it's almost 150 million people,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.340]   saying like 143 million customers.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.540]   Absolutely horrifying,
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.140]   but absolutely predictable thing
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.580]   in the world that we live in.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.780]   If you're part of the 143 million Equifax clients
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.980]   and there's no way to opt out,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.700]   the system works where you're just opted in
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.740]   whether you want to or not,
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.420]   you better take care of that.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.280]   Guess what was a part of that breach?
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.420]   Your personal data.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.100]   Say obviously,
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.580]   but your personal data
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.580]   with an extreme amount of granularity.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.060]   It's my understanding,
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.040]   and I'm speaking without having fully done the research
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.900]   due to restricted access and hurricane preparation
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.980]   for myself here in South Florida this last week,
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.760]   so we'll do this one, I can confirm these.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.660]   If this turns out to be wrong, let me know.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.700]   But it's my understanding from the news reports
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.180]   that, let's go with this one.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.900]   If you were an Equifax customer
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.860]   and you bought Equifax's credit monitoring service,
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.260]   your banking information was released to the hackers.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.020]   The information that you used to buy
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.220]   credit monitoring protection from Equifax
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.660]   is now in the hands of criminals
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.620]   and could possibly be used against you.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.120]   Well, let's say that you ran that from your checking account
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.980]   using your debit card,
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.740]   which you ran as a credit card with Equifax online.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.420]   Now a thief has access to your credit card
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.140]   and they can start initiating fraudulent transactions
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.160]   against your account.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.960]   You can drain an account real quick.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.420]   One time I had my luggage stolen when I was traveling.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.080]   I was traveling in Central America
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.260]   and our rental car was broken into,
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.060]   my backpack was in the trunk of the car.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.740]   In that backpack, we were at the beach,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.220]   in that backpack, my passport was stolen,
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.580]   as was some of my credit cards and information.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.860]   You would not believe how quickly a thief
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.260]   can run hundreds of dollars of gas transactions.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.500]   That's what all the transactions were,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.580]   it was all at gas stations.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.900]   Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.700]   across multiple cards.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.540]   At local gasoline stations.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.900]   You wouldn't believe how quickly that can be done.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.360]   That's done on your primary checking account,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.400]   that wipes you out.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.900]   So if you kept all of your emergency fund
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.580]   in your checking account,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.300]   and your checking account was drained
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.680]   while you're in Costa Rica,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.020]   guess I just gave up the country there,
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.980]   I was going to say Central America.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   While you're in Central America
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.120]   and your checking account is drained
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.200]   and your credit cards are drained,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.100]   and you're trying to figure out how do I,
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.500]   with no passport and no money,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.080]   if it was all in the bag,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.620]   how do I get in contact with my bank
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.460]   and figure out how to get money
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.620]   so that I can get these things stopped
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.740]   and how do I figure out how I can pay for a hotel
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.780]   and how do I figure out how to work
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.260]   all these situations out.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.020]   If all the money was in your checking account,
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.520]   you had a problem with access.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.140]   You need to have some restriction on access.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.660]   And I'm kind of conflating both access,
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.620]   restricting access for you personally,
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.580]   and also safety, which is the next thing.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.800]   So let's talk about safety.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.060]   You need to think about safety.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.560]   Safety in multiple formats.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.820]   Number one would be safety from thieves.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.560]   How do you keep your money safe from thieves?
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.620]   The theft can be something like I just described.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.200]   If you have a big wad of cash
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.440]   and you put it all on a backpack
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.760]   and leave it in a rental car
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.900]   on the beaches of Central America,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.140]   you're inviting a problem with your emergency funds.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.940]   But what if you are in a contentious situation
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.700]   with creditors?
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.160]   I've done some crisis financial counseling
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.540]   with people from time to time
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.540]   who are facing severe problems,
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.620]   woefully behind on their debt.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.620]   And I want to be clear, this is the word theft.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.280]   I don't want to paint with a broad stroke.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.940]   The thief in the situation of somebody
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.380]   who has unpaid debts is the person
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.420]   who hasn't paid their debts.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.140]   They've stolen from the creditor.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.460]   But what often happens is as that person
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.960]   is seeking to make restitution and pay back the creditor,
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.420]   sometimes the creditor can come
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.260]   and invade the person's accounts without permission.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.580]   And so this arrangement is one in which
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   there is no legal or moral theft being committed.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.740]   You can't go before a judge and say,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.140]   judge, I owe this creditor a lot of money
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.300]   and they came into my account
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.140]   and they took back what was theirs.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.540]   Judge says, well, you owe them the money.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.940]   You were the thief, you're the debtor.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.660]   You're the person who stole from your creditor
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.260]   because you became behind on your bills
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.440]   and you didn't make the payments as agreed.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.700]   But in the context,
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.900]   I should have chosen a different example,
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.340]   but in this context, I'm just simply referring
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.680]   to the fact that you've got to figure out
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.700]   how to keep your money safe.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.680]   If you're in that situation,
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.200]   you're fighting your way out of debt,
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.540]   you're fighting your way out with all of these creditors,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.780]   you can't have a bunch of money stuck in a place
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.860]   where the creditors can get access to it.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.540]   The problem this faces for the person who's going through,
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.940]   and if you're doing counseling
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.260]   with somebody in this situation,
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.380]   somebody who's going back, they're paying off their debts,
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.740]   they're making restitution,
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.000]   is oftentimes the daily existence is so hand to mouth,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.020]   the money is so tight
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.820]   that if any dollar is unaccounted for,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.980]   wrecks the whole thing.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.540]   What I have people do in that situations
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.500]   is to establish entirely different accounts.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.220]   Ideally, to fix it, usually,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.200]   I'd encourage the person to go to an all cash lifestyle,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.180]   where every bill is paid in cash,
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.860]   and all budgeting is done in cash,
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.060]   because usually the reason why somebody is behind,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.520]   especially if they have lots of credit cards,
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.200]   lots of creditors like that,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.320]   usually it's due to chronic overspending
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.260]   and lack of discipline and lack of a plan
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.960]   with their finances.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.300]   This is different if you're maybe doing counseling
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.980]   for somebody who has experienced a large business loss,
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.140]   and they had a business to turn around,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:16.980]   and they got a huge debt,
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.220]   but it's one or two huge debts,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.700]   that's a very different circumstance.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.060]   But your neighbor who is struggling,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.400]   who's facing severe crisis
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.780]   because they overspent on their credit cards,
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.300]   and now they're trying to figure out their way out,
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.980]   the answer is they need to go to cash.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.420]   And any bills that need to be paid,
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.660]   just pay them with a money order.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.940]   It's worth the 60 cents you pay
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.500]   to buy a postal money order
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.620]   in order to send the money off
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.900]   and not have to deal with the checking account.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.300]   Keep the checking account secure.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.700]   Maybe only use it to pay the mortgage company.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.540]   But you have to think about
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.100]   how do you protect the emergency funds?
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.460]   So that's one aspect of safety.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.260]   The obvious examples would be thieves, things like that.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:56.120]   I would not keep $100,000 in my spare bedroom,
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.100]   especially given my own personal risk profiles.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.780]   Being a public figure, talking about money,
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.620]   I have to take a very different approach
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.980]   to financial safety and security than you do.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.780]   You have a different risk profile.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.720]   But what about the stability of the money?
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.640]   Stability is another aspect of safety.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.960]   You have to think about the safety of your funds
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.360]   with regard to the stability of the bank.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.520]   FDIC insurance in the United States is very important.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   You want to protect yourself
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.680]   and make sure that you are effectively using the FDIC limits.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.120]   If you keep more than $250,000
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.660]   as part of your emergency fund portfolio,
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.600]   diversify that account into multiple account titling
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.840]   so that you can maintain FDIC insurance.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.020]   And you can take this discussion of stability far beyond.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.640]   Obviously, you should think carefully
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.900]   about the stability of the type of savings that you have.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.480]   And here, you always have moving targets.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.260]   You could just simply keep US dollars.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.720]   US dollar, probably the safest currency in the world,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.180]   very, very stable, the world's reserve currency at present.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.120]   That's one thing.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.720]   But what do you do if you are banking
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.520]   in a different currency?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.920]   Or if you're concerned about the stability
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.000]   and safety of your US dollars?
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.380]   Your US dollars can quickly be eroded by inflation risk.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.600]   If the Federal Reserve is unable to curb inflation
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.020]   and there starts to be a time
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.140]   of significant overall mass inflation or hyperinflation,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.920]   very rare in Western economies, but it does happen.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.700]   It's happening in Venezuela right now.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.580]   All of a sudden, the money that you thought was safe
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.540]   in the bank, protected from thieves,
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.040]   is now experiencing a different risk.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.220]   So think about the different risks
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.000]   that it can impact your money.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.440]   You should also think about protecting yourself
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.240]   against things like sovereign risk.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.280]   What do you do if you are living and working
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.020]   in the United States and earning money,
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.500]   saving within the US financial system, et cetera?
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.320]   And all of a sudden, the US government declares
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.820]   that you are unwelcome
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   because you don't have a stamp on a piece of paper
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.980]   that says that you have the permission
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.120]   to be in this physical geographic location and to do work.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.920]   Well, if you face such a circumstance,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.360]   that can dramatically impact your banking life.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.120]   That can dramatically impact
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.000]   just about every aspect of your life.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.980]   You might need to put in place a better strategy
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.760]   with your money to make sure that you have a fallback plan,
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.360]   if that were to ever happen.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.800]   Bring in some diversification.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.360]   Well, same thing happens in all kinds of other areas.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.860]   Back to our caller, US citizen.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.960]   So he doesn't have to worry about the US government
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.840]   putting a little stamp on a piece of paper
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.480]   that says he's allowed to be in a certain place
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.400]   and to do a certain kind of work.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.920]   But now he's moving abroad and he has to think,
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.440]   well, what do I do with my money
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.520]   and how do I protect myself from my risk in this country?
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.640]   Briefly in that call, that was where I encouraged him.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.160]   And I said, if I were in Asia,
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.680]   I'd make sure to set up a financial life
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.600]   and put in place financial planning strategies
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.200]   in Hong Kong or Singapore, whatever's most convenient,
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.360]   where he can get to least inexpensively.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.080]   Appropriate measures of diversification
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.800]   apply across all of this, but you have to consider,
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.480]   what are the risks that I face?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.980]   What are the most likely risks?
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.360]   None of these things are likely if you have $3,000.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   Nobody cares about $3,000 from, you know,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.800]   the government of so-and-so doesn't care about that.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   But the local drug dealer that knows you keep $3,000
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.360]   in your right front pocket does.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.200]   So that's safety.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.720]   Number one was access.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.160]   Number two is safety.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.400]   Number three is rate of return.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.620]   Rate of return matters.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.520]   But remember what we're talking about here,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.060]   an emergency fund.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.500]   And in an emergency,
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.520]   it's the return of your money
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.200]   or the access to your money
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.820]   that matters more than the rate of return on your money.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.380]   We're not talking about an investment.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.640]   We're talking about an emergency fund.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.180]   So I will, me personally, I will give up
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.900]   potential rate of return
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:30.260]   if I can gain greater access
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.500]   and greater safety.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.380]   Now, if I can get more,
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.440]   if I get rate of return and diversification
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.180]   and, sorry, rate of return and access and safety,
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.020]   that might be good.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.300]   But I, you know, I kind of think that these are
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.580]   one of those old choose two.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.500]   You can have this good, cheap, or fast.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.980]   You pick any two you want.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.940]   I kind of feel like, in this circumstance,
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.060]   I feel like that's what this is.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.540]   I don't know any way to get all three of these
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.860]   in any one particular financial product
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.500]   or any one particular financial decision
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.980]   or financial choice.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.340]   I think it's a matter of what's the proper emphasis.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.460]   And in the places where you're probably
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.200]   going to get more return,
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.600]   you're giving up something else.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.680]   You might be giving up safety
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.460]   or you might be giving up access.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.600]   Let's go with some examples to demonstrate the point.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.200]   Number one would be a savings account.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.280]   Well, right now, savings accounts pay you about 0.0
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.060]   in terms of rate of return,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.080]   or at least your local bank
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.680]   or your local credit union is paying you that.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.900]   But sometimes, by setting up a banking relationship
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.620]   with a different bank, perhaps an online bank,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.280]   you could get a higher rate of return.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.160]   The problem is this.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.120]   If you don't regularly bank with that online bank
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.560]   that's offering the higher rate of return,
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.200]   you might get a little bit more in interest,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.120]   but you give up access.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.600]   If you have two separate banking institutions,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.480]   you can't do simultaneous same-day transfers of money.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.800]   And I have, in my lifetime,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.260]   often found that to be a very valuable feature.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.800]   There've been times I see something, it's a good deal.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.200]   I bought cars this way.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.760]   I bought all kinds of stuff this way.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.640]   Hey, this is a good deal.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.460]   I need money.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.280]   I don't have this much money in my checking account.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.340]   I want to write a check.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.840]   I may not have the cash.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.160]   Boom, transfer the money from savings to checking,
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.480]   go to the ATM, get a bunch of cash out.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.360]   If I keep my emergent, that's an opportunity really,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.600]   but if I'm keeping my emergency fund in an account
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.900]   that's different from my primary bank,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.560]   I might have higher return, but I'm giving up access.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.400]   That's important.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.720]   Another example, buying a CD.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.880]   I think having a laddered CD portfolio
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.240]   is an excellent strategy for some of your emergency fund.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.080]   When you buy CDs, certificates of deposit,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.100]   you can often get a significant rate of return
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.760]   or a more significant rate of return
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.840]   than just simply using the money,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.440]   having the money in a savings account
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.320]   or a money market account.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.360]   A CD, because it's a contractual agreement
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.520]   where you're going to leave the money in
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.480]   for a certain amount of time,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.080]   is often willing to pay you more interest.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.400]   And what you can do is you can set up a laddered portfolio.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.560]   The idea of a laddered portfolio
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.000]   is you purchase investments,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.600]   let's just go with you purchase CDs
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.120]   that have different rates of maturity
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.940]   so that they come mature at different times.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.940]   The longer amount of time that you purchase on a CD contract
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.820]   the higher the rate of return that you'll get.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.980]   So if you buy a 12-month CD,
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.500]   you'll get a higher rate of return than a three-month CD.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.460]   And so the idea of a laddered portfolio
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.740]   is let's say that you're going to keep $120,000
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.180]   in an emergency fund.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.040]   No, let's use $10,000 in emergency fund for simpler math.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.460]   We're gonna use $10,000 in emergency fund.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.160]   And you think that in general,
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.400]   the emergency you're primarily concerned with
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.640]   is something like a job layoff, et cetera.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.920]   But you know that if you face something like a job layoff,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.220]   you wouldn't need our money all of a sudden,
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.640]   you would need the money over time.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.240]   And so what you may do is you take your $10,000
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.960]   and you purchase a three-month CD, a six-month CD,
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.600]   a nine-month CD, and a 12-month CD.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.240]   And you go ahead and purchase four individual CDs
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.040]   and you line them up so that each quarter
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.620]   one of those CDs is going to become mature.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.900]   Well, you're gonna get a higher rate of interest
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.380]   on the 12-month CD than you are on any of the others.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.220]   Three months from now, when your $2,500 CD matures,
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.820]   you go ahead and at that point in time,
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.420]   you purchase a 12-month CD.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.360]   And then from here on out, every single quarter,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.740]   you purchase a new 12-month CD.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.060]   You've now built a laddered portfolio
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:55.060]   where every quarter you have a CD that's becoming mature,
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.480]   thus releasing the cash and the interest,
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.860]   and is earning you a higher rate of interest.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.780]   And you've set it up so that every quarter
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.540]   you're gonna have access to that $2,500.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.460]   That's what a laddered portfolio is.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.360]   I think that's an excellent strategy,
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.800]   an excellent strategy for some of your emergency funds.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.840]   But what you're getting is restricted access.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.020]   Yes, you can invade the principal when you need to.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.860]   With most CD contracts, you can get the principal,
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.140]   you just give up the interest.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.140]   So you do still have some access,
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.980]   but you don't get the instantaneous access
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.860]   that you get in the savings account.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.680]   You certainly don't get the instantaneous access
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.160]   that you get of having currency.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.720]   You might keep $1,000 of currency, cash,
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.960]   physical greenback, green paper, in your pocket.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.740]   And now you have the ability to have money
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.100]   that's ready at hand.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.240]   You have tremendous access.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.080]   It's right there.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.740]   You can buy anything that you want with it,
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.980]   other than plane tickets.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.460]   But now you have to contend with safety of that money.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.500]   Well, in a way it's safe because it's in your hands.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.420]   So you don't have to worry about somebody else
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.240]   just simply taking it from your account.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.160]   But now you have to figure out the safety from thieves
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.060]   that might rob you at gunpoint
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.020]   or steal your backpack out of your car.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.220]   And you've given up the rate of return
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.680]   that you might have by having the money invested.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.340]   It's not that you shouldn't keep cash in your pocket.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.920]   You should.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.540]   But it's a balancing act among these three factors.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:35.100]   So I believe that you should consider the rate of return
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.500]   as one part of your planning.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:42.280]   But think carefully and don't run the risk
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.880]   of not having access to your money when you need it
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.860]   because you were laser focused on rate of return
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.620]   as being the discriminating factor.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.080]   I wanna close out today's show
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.880]   with some rapid fire discussion
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.580]   of just a number of different ideas on emergency funds
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.040]   and some very practical tips that I hope will help you
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.880]   and will serve you.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.240]   I don't claim that this list is exhaustive,
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.160]   but these are some practical tips,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.960]   some things that will help you.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.240]   The number one access to money that most people will employ
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.880]   when they face an emergency is in the form of credit.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.680]   And I think that's perfectly fine.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.440]   So here are some things that you should consider
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.720]   with regard to credit.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.560]   Most people, that means a credit card.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.800]   And credit cards are tremendously useful
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.640]   because unless there's a physical emergency,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.280]   unless a hurricane has just flown over St. Martin's
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.080]   while you're on the island,
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.960]   and you were there on vacation in St. Martin
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.920]   and Hurricane Irma came through, you couldn't get out,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.020]   now your credit cards don't work
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.840]   because the whole infrastructure is destroyed.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.680]   That happens.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.640]   You should be prepared.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.720]   Hint, hint, when you travel, you should make sure.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.440]   One rule I teach people,
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.400]   and I've encouraged lots of people,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.480]   is whenever you travel,
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.000]   always make sure you have enough cash to get home.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.520]   So when you are traveling close to home,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.080]   you can often do that just simply with currency.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.220]   If you're traveling far from home,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.780]   then you may be able to do that with currency,
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.020]   or you might need to do that
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.840]   with something like precious metals.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.480]   In a moment, I'll talk about tangibles.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.640]   But if let's say that you're on St. Martin
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.880]   and you need to get home,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.840]   well, money speaks, cash speaks.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.560]   Problem is, how much cash do you need to get home?
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.680]   What if the airlines aren't going
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.320]   and you gotta book a trip on a boat
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.740]   to another Caribbean island?
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.160]   Because many of the larger countries of the world
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.760]   have diminished the large denomination of bills
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.600]   that are printed,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.420]   the US government doesn't print anything bigger
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.760]   than a $100 bill.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.560]   Used to be you could use a 500 euro bill.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.680]   It was a huge amount of money that was very compact,
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.600]   and you could carry enough cash in that form.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.960]   But many of the governments have been rolling back
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.560]   printing larger denomination currencies.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.360]   And so if I were going to St. Martin,
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.320]   I'd wanna make sure that I had a couple of gold coins
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.920]   that I could take to a local coin shop and swap out.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.360]   Wanna make sure that I had some currency
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.080]   in large denominations stashed away that could get me home.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.640]   So always carry enough cash to get you home.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.480]   I got off track.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.760]   Oh, credit.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.040]   So the number of circumstances in which that could happen,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.720]   sorry, those examples of when credit doesn't work
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.120]   are few and far between.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.000]   You basically need a loss of infrastructure
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.540]   in order for digital money to not work
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.240]   or digital credit to not work.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.880]   Credit cards are effective.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.240]   So think about your credit card strategy.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.080]   Number one, make sure that you have access
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.400]   to a diversity of credit card issuers.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.920]   If Visa's not taken, maybe MasterCard will be.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.240]   If American Express isn't taken, maybe Discover will be.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.880]   I face this a lot with traveling.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.220]   Oftentimes there'll be one brand that's approved,
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.560]   but another one that's not.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.480]   And sometimes it'll be in the strangest places.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.220]   You'll find an establishment that won't,
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.140]   they'll sell you stuff, but they won't sell you stuff
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.980]   if you're trying to use a MasterCard.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.860]   So you can diversify your credit card holdings.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.540]   Have a Visa, have a MasterCard,
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.640]   have an American Express, have a Discover.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.900]   You can diversify those credit cards
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.580]   and then have access to them when you need them.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.580]   Of course, you need to make sure
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.460]   that you have significant balances available to you
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.940]   on those credit cards.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.800]   The caveat here is if you don't have a spending problem.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.320]   Significant balances can be a major problem
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.280]   and a major temptation if you have a spending problem.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.760]   It could be a major help
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.000]   if they're there for an emergency situation.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.040]   Credit cards, however, are a great form of emergency cash
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.120]   for an emergency that's short-term
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.000]   in order to get you out of a problem.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.960]   But you better only use them
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.060]   if you actually have the money to pay 'em off.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.840]   The best use of credit cards is travel.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.580]   When you travel, you should carry with you
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.200]   a diversity of credit cards.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   And those credit cards should be placed
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.980]   in a diverse arrangement in your luggage and belongings.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.960]   Credit cards are wonderful from a safety perspective
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.780]   because of the enhanced consumer protection
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.240]   in the case of fraud.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.320]   So you might have, of course, your normal card
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.200]   that is has, maybe you're doing foreign travel.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.480]   You might have your normal card
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.320]   that has the most advantageous currency,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.000]   no currency conversion charges and a good conversion rate.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   And that's the card that you keep in your wallet
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.400]   that you use while you're abroad.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.040]   And that's the card that would be your primary situation,
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.280]   your primary card to refer to
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.400]   in a situation where you need to buy something.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.760]   You need to buy a plane ticket home
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.480]   because you just found out that your daughter is sick
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.560]   and you gotta get home.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.660]   Well, you whip out that card
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.400]   and that's the one that you use.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.120]   But of course, you should have a second one.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.440]   I'm gonna speak generally here, stuck in your shoe.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.680]   And you put it under your shoe so that if your credit,
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.040]   if your wallet is lifted, it's pickpocketed,
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.560]   then you still have enough of a way
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   to book a, buy a collect call or get yourself to the,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.320]   get yourself home, buy a train ticket,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.760]   whatever you need to do.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.280]   Had my wallet stolen, been there, done that,
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.320]   learned the hard way.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.680]   So when you travel, you should have,
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.360]   and you should have a Visa and a MasterCard
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.980]   and an American Express all able to come to hand easily
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.580]   in case you're in a place where you need that money.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.560]   But you can, you should stash your cards
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.440]   in a diversity of ways.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.160]   So you're enhancing your safety
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.880]   because you're protecting yourself
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.160]   so that you have emergency funds
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.160]   so you can get home if necessary.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.120]   You have emergency funds that are stable,
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.520]   they're safe from thieves.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.480]   If the card is stolen, you won't be liable.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.560]   You're not risking your personal
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   checking account information in a foreign location
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.880]   where that information could be problematic
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.480]   if it were disclosed.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.120]   And you have backup, so if your luggage is stolen,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.520]   you have the credit card in your pocket.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.320]   If your wallet is stolen, you have the credit card
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.520]   that you stashed in your luggage, et cetera.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.920]   The point of all this is that you can apply,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.560]   as you're thinking about your personal emergency planning,
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.860]   you can apply a thoughtful approach
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.160]   to the credit cards that you have
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.720]   to make sure that they are diverse,
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.880]   that they're safe, and that they're useful to you
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   in a time of emergency.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.400]   Other applications of credit would be something
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.720]   like a home equity line of credit.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.080]   Many people have significant home equity,
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.400]   and there could be circumstances in which
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.820]   you need to have access to that money for an emergency.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.080]   Best to line that up in advance.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.260]   Best not to go and try to be applying
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.380]   for a home equity line of credit
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.880]   and getting the appraisal done with the bank
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.360]   at the time of the acute crisis.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.600]   Maybe you had emergency surgery,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.680]   or you've had an emergency C-section,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   your wife has had an emergency C-section,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.120]   and now all of a sudden you need to have $30,000
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.360]   to pay the hospital bill.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.120]   That's not the time to go and try to figure out
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.820]   how to make the home equity line of credit appear.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.920]   Do it in advance.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.360]   Get it laid aside.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.220]   Another example of credit would be something
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.640]   like a 401(k) loan.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   A 401(k) loan can be a very reasonable and serviceable way
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.700]   for you to have access to money.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.840]   As part of your emergency plan.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.280]   There are risks to a 401(k) loan.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.200]   If you're losing your job and you have a 401(k) loan,
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.120]   that's a problem, 'cause now you gotta figure out
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.960]   how to get that thing paid back,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.660]   and it's gotta be paid back pretty quickly.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.400]   But there are benefits to a 401(k) loan.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.960]   A 401(k) loan can often be gotten very quickly
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.360]   without any questions asked
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.700]   as far as the purpose of the money.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.680]   And often when you need money,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.620]   you kinda need money without needing to tell anybody,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.920]   or defend it to anybody.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.680]   So perhaps you might prepare for that
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.200]   by reading about your accounts
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.400]   and reading what has to happen in order for a 401(k) loan
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.120]   to happen at your local, in your personal plan.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.800]   So that'd just be examples of credit.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.320]   Another example of credit would just be the personal credit
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.580]   that you have with family and friends.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.600]   Are you the kind of person who is reliable?
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.360]   Are you the kind of person who does what you say
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.180]   and who will make sure that if you need money,
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.380]   you borrow it, you borrow it and you pay it back?
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.660]   What often happens is the people
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.580]   who are the most desperate for money
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.760]   find it the hardest to get
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.600]   because nobody has any confidence in them
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.740]   that they would ever pay it back.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.900]   I'm sure you know somebody
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.380]   who is just always looking for money,
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.700]   always looking for a source of money,
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.300]   and they'll often find that no matter what door
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.280]   they knock on, it's closed.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.740]   But if you're a person of your word,
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.600]   you can find that many doors will open to you.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.840]   And it's important not to be so fixated
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.120]   on the mainstream approach to money
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:41.360]   that you miss out on the traditional approach to money.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.640]   What happens is the stupid Equifaxes of the world
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.800]   and the Experian and the TransUnion
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.640]   have us all trained like little monkeys
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.240]   that jump for a credit score.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.840]   Well, a credit score is one way of measuring risk.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.980]   And it's certainly a very valid way of measuring risk,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.900]   but it measures risk across financial transactions
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.180]   and accounts that are mainstream.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.620]   It measures risk and it's a risk mitigating factor
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:11.660]   for somebody who has an impersonal relationship with you.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:16.100]   It's a wonderful invention.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.980]   The modern credit system is a wonderful invention
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   because it allows there to be a level of trust
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.480]   between people who have no historic experience together
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.460]   of trust, it's wonderful.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.620]   Little annoyed, I just said stupid Equifax
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.400]   because there's some things I hate about it
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.340]   and I hate it, the stupid data breach,
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.060]   but little offended by that.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.680]   And I'm a little bit annoyed because it's inevitable,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   but anyway, point is it's a wonderful system,
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.260]   but it's not the only system.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:52.580]   If you needed money today,
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.540]   if you needed to be bailed out of jail,
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.680]   would you have to go to the bail bondsman?
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.420]   Or could you make a phone call to somebody
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.540]   that you think would have the money
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.220]   and they would come down and bail you out,
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.780]   knowing that you're good for it?
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:10.180]   If you're doing a deal, you're doing a business deal,
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.720]   and you are running a little bit short,
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.660]   are you the kind of person who can say to somebody,
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.460]   "Listen, I might need some money, can you write me a check
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.740]   "and I'm good for it?"
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.860]   This happened to me one time, I was doing a deal,
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.220]   I had enough money, I thought I was good,
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.400]   but then I started to get nervous.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.820]   And I went to somebody and I said,
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.380]   "Listen, I don't think I'll need it,
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.840]   "but if I do, I'd like to have access to it."
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.020]   They wrote me a five-figure check,
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.420]   I had it available if I needed to cash it,
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.740]   wound up, my planning was good, I didn't need their money,
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.780]   took it back and shredded the thing and was good to go.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.660]   But that's how all kinds of stuff happens every day.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.780]   This happens all the time.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.220]   Happens in the context of buying and selling houses.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.100]   Most people buy in houses and they wind up
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.700]   and all of a sudden they need money.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.540]   So don't ignore your personal creditworthiness.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.740]   You don't have to go on some dramatic way to say,
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.660]   "Let me work together my financial statements."
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.980]   Although there's a place for that,
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.020]   if you're in business and you're expanding your business,
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.780]   just putting together some financial statements
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.820]   so that your creditors can be confident
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.100]   in doing business with you has a place.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.180]   But for most of us,
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.300]   it's just called being a person of your word,
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.300]   saying what you're going to do and doing what you say.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.780]   The credit is certainly the number one aspect,
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.980]   thing that most people will tap in an emergency.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.140]   So don't ignore it.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.740]   What about cash?
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.000]   Well, of course, here you got cash in your wallet.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.180]   I think that's really wise to always make sure
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.780]   that you have cash in your wallet.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.820]   My generation seems to have a disease
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:50.520]   where they just don't want to deal with cash
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.180]   and it's to our detriment.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   I see nothing good that comes from it.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.940]   People talk all the time about safety.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.500]   Well, I just feel unsafe walking around
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.340]   with money in my wallet.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.280]   Well, I've lost wallets, I've been robbed,
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.580]   but I've never been robbed because I was walking around
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.340]   with money in my wallet and somebody came
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.040]   and stuck a gun in my ribs.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.980]   So the idea of you're walking around
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.460]   with money in your wallet is really not all that dangerous.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.460]   It's absurd.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.740]   But having cash in your wallet is important.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.340]   Having cash stashed in a place
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.300]   that you can get to quickly is important.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.900]   There might be an amount of cash
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.980]   that you want to have at home
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.860]   and consider diversifying where you have that.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.740]   Consider hiding it carefully, securing it carefully.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.900]   All of this needs to be amount appropriate.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:37.300]   Don't buy a vault that costs you $1,000
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.780]   just to stash $1,000.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.320]   But if you're going to have $100,000 at home,
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.500]   better make sure it's protected.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.540]   I probably, and sometime I probably will do a class on this.
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.500]   I have a bunch of ideas on home security
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:57.160]   and kind of not all cheap, but inexpensive,
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.820]   but effective tools of home security.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.620]   So I've done a lot of research on the subject.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.340]   And just a little tip for you.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.940]   If you ever need a safe, you ever need a home safe,
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.140]   the safest kind of safe for money or for valuable items.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.780]   This doesn't work for guns, things like that,
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.740]   except handguns, you need a gun, you know, a long gun safe.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.420]   If you're going to have, try to do that,
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.740]   which many people, those are the easiest ones
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:19.620]   to find everyone.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.460]   You can find those everywhere.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.100]   But if you just want a safe to protect your valuables,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.900]   safe to protect cash,
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:28.900]   the safest approach is a floor safe.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.180]   And a floor safe can be more effectively hidden
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.620]   than almost any other safe.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   So go with, if you need a place,
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.020]   if you're the kind of person who you're going to keep
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.560]   $100,000 of cash in your house,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.700]   go with a floor safe and then make sure
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.460]   that you've stashed it in a place
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.180]   that's not in your master bedroom.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.700]   It needs to be protected and it needs to be hidden.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.900]   A hidden floor safe is very secure
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.180]   from the invasion of a thief.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.540]   Most thieves, if it's effectively hidden,
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.740]   hidden under carpet, under furniture, et cetera,
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.300]   most thieves are probably not going to find it
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.140]   unless you've disclosed its location
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.540]   and the thief is a personal acquaintance.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.200]   So that's effective protection against that,
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.580]   which is a big one.
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.960]   It's effective protection against
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.040]   many of the physical dangers that exist.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.620]   A tornado will blow your house off of it,
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.680]   but the safe will still be there in the floor.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.480]   A fire will have less heat down low on the floor
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.240]   and your items will be more protected from heat
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.200]   than in an above ground safe.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.120]   And your major risk that you face
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.720]   with a floor safe is flooding.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.600]   So of course it's below, if your house is flooded,
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.640]   your items will be flooded.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.760]   So waterproof your items that you have in the floor safe.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.800]   But it's very reasonable for you to do that.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.280]   You could do it yourself.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.200]   Run a jackhammer and knock a hole in the floor
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.800]   and fill it up, put a safe in and fill it up with cement.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.000]   YouTube is your friend.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.320]   Of course, you can stash your cash
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.080]   in a local safety deposit box.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.280]   Wonderful scenario.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.080]   Gives you a great amount of protection from many risks.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.480]   Not perfect protection from all things,
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.920]   but a great amount of protection from many risks.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.680]   And then of course you can stash your cash abroad
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.020]   or some other place in the next town over.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.040]   If you stash some cash in a safe deposit box
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:19.880]   in the next town over,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.800]   you have the benefit of quick access when you need it,
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.320]   but a little bit of distance where it's hard to get to.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.460]   You got to really think about it on the way there.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.880]   If you are concerned about having money outside
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.120]   at your sovereign risk,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.840]   my friend in, or my caller in,
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.640]   my friend caller in on the Friday show,
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.760]   if I were in a discontented country in Asia,
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.940]   I would set up cash in a safe deposit box in Hong Kong.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.760]   For those of you who are US citizens,
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.560]   the United States government requires you to report
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.920]   any financial relationships that you have
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.420]   and any money that you have anywhere in the world.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.320]   So if you are opening a Hong Kong bank account
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.560]   and you're a US citizen,
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.180]   you need to report that account to the US government.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.600]   However, currency that is held in a foreign country,
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.740]   as long as it's not held with a banking institution,
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.480]   a strong box with currency in it is not reportable
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.580]   to the best of my understanding at present.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.400]   So if you read the law,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.940]   obviously it's one thing to be concerned
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.860]   about the US government.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.600]   It's another thing to be concerned about
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.560]   the local terrorists who stick an AK-47 in your ribs
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.560]   and say, "We're going to take all the money in your house."
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.600]   If I'm living in the Southern Philippines,
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.680]   I'm not keeping a floor safe in my house.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:43.240]   I'm keeping a box, a secure box in Hong Kong.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.240]   Or I did the story where I talked about,
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.360]   a few weeks ago I talked about Mexico City
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.920]   and some of the Mexican drug cartels that pay off people
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.240]   or just simply extort the people in the local bank,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.000]   the employees of the bank to disclose
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.640]   how much money people have in their accounts.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.000]   In that situation, if I live in Mexico City,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.680]   I'm going to take different actions.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.500]   So you got to think about your situation and be practical,
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.280]   but think carefully about your situation
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.360]   and consider carefully where you stash your cash.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.320]   There are lots of options.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.960]   Choose and develop a plan that gives you the safety,
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.360]   sorry, the access, the safety and the rate of return
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   that's appropriate for you.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.400]   Let's talk about banking.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.280]   If you're in the United States, focus on making sure
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.680]   that your bank accounts are protected by the FDIC.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.080]   If you are abroad, make sure that your bank accounts
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.840]   are protected by whatever the local version
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.400]   of deposit insurance is.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.280]   Very, very important.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.720]   Very, very valuable.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.420]   United States FDIC protection is up to $250,000 per account,
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.400]   but it's based upon account titling.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.520]   So if you need to stash more cash
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.860]   and you are in excess of that number,
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.080]   just diversify the way that your accounts are titled.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.640]   You may have an account for,
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.080]   I may have an account for me,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.000]   I may have an account that has exclusively
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.160]   my wife's name on it, and we may have a joint account.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.120]   Well, under the way that the US law is written,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.680]   you could put $250,000 in each of those accounts,
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.360]   and that amount of money is protected by FDIC insurance.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.000]   Banks go belly up.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.440]   You need to protect yourself.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.120]   The credit union,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.040]   what's it called, the credit deposit guarantee.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.760]   Credit unions, there's a credit union version of the FDIC,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.240]   which is just as good as the FDIC,
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.000]   and credit unions are better in that context
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   than in many contexts.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.120]   They're very good.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.740]   Think about FDIC.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.500]   Think about the diversity of your banking relationships.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.660]   There is value to banking with a large
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.400]   national or international bank.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.860]   Tremendous amount of value in it.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.080]   If you have an account with a Bank of America,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.720]   anywhere in the United States, there's a local branch.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   That can be very helpful.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.240]   If you have an account with HSBC,
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.420]   practically anywhere in the world,
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.040]   you can find HSBC offices,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.120]   especially in Asia, as an example,
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.280]   and pick the regional version.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.680]   So there may be benefit for you of banking
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.120]   with a regional or international or national bank,
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.080]   especially one that has brick and mortar locations.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.640]   On the flip side, there are advantages
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.300]   to banking with a bank that does not have
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.480]   brick and mortar locations,
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.240]   that has a purely digital footprint.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.080]   That can get you higher rates of return, lower costs.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.560]   There are benefits there.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.320]   There are benefits in banking with banking institutions
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   that are brick and mortar, but that are exclusively local.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.620]   If you're looking for private money,
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.060]   don't go to Bank of America.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.880]   Lots of reasons you shouldn't go to Bank of America,
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.040]   but if you're looking for private money,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.040]   there's not reason to go there.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.360]   But you might be able to find a little out-of-the-way bank
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.680]   with a few branches in some little out-of-the-way corner
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.880]   of the world that is perfectly safe,
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.680]   but would allow you to stash your cash in their bank.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.320]   Buys you a much more private banking relationship
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.680]   than other opportunities.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.760]   Now, you give up some of that access.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.520]   Might be hard for you to bank with that little
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.680]   out-of-the-way bank in a little rural part of the world,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.680]   but it does buy you more safety, buys you more privacy.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.160]   And in some kind of emergencies,
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.820]   that privacy and that safety is significant.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.320]   Or perhaps the same thing applies to you
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.820]   with cross-border banking.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.680]   You live in Mexico, but you bank in the United States,
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.800]   or you live in the United States, or you bank in Canada,
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.660]   or you live in Canada and you bank in somewhere.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.560]   You get the point.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.080]   There are benefits to having things set up
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.000]   across the border.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.040]   Again, just think about that story that I heard
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.900]   from the people down there in Mexico.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:00.240]   I would be very careful banking with a Mexican bank
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.920]   in that circumstance.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.600]   Obviously, there's gonna be a certain level of requirement
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.720]   of you gotta pay your bills,
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.860]   and there's gotta be drawn on a local bank.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.640]   But in terms of keeping large amounts of funds there,
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.280]   sorry, but that's a risk that would be too high for me.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.120]   So obviously, credit, cash, and banking relationships
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.780]   are going to be wonderful solutions for you
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.760]   and good places for you to keep your emergency fund.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.800]   What else?
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.480]   Well, securities.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.560]   Certain types of securities can be tremendous places
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.240]   for you to keep your emergency funds.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.520]   Your securities could be treasuries, T-bills,
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.720]   or bonds or notes, depending on your duration.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.680]   But just having a T-bill account
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.080]   directly with the federal government,
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.240]   have you ever thought about the problem of,
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.160]   if you had $10 million and you needed to keep it in cash,
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.840]   where would you keep it?
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.160]   The answer is obvious, it's T-bills.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.120]   That's what you do.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.340]   It's safe, it's guaranteed, it's secure.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.600]   You get reasonable interest, market rate of interest,
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.200]   and you get reasonable access.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.520]   So that might be appropriate for you.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:14.600]   And there are other types of securities as well
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.560]   that may be helpful for you.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.640]   You might have some bonds or some stable bond funds
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.760]   that are part of your emergency funds.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.160]   You don't need to have 400, I mean, depending on the scale.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:30.760]   Most normal people don't need to have $200,000
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.880]   available to them for an emergency.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.280]   You don't need $200,000 in your home safe.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.800]   For most people, that would be silly
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.400]   in the scale that most of us are living at.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.000]   Too much opportunity cost on the money
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.160]   and what kind of $200,000 emergency would be faced
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.480]   where you'd have to have the cash?
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:53.000]   I'm not involved in that world, and I doubt you are either.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.040]   But on the flip side, maybe you're a landlord
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.280]   and you have a significant number of properties
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.000]   and you're choosing to self-insure
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.280]   and carry high deductibles
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.780]   and carry significant personal risk
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.620]   on some of your insurance contracts.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:12.840]   Well, it wouldn't be unreasonable in that situation
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.000]   for you as a landlord to need to have access to $200,000.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.520]   Hurricane Irma wipes through Florida,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.840]   damages a number of your properties,
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.400]   you've got big deductibles all around.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.920]   What do you do?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.440]   You don't need all of the money sitting in the bank.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.000]   You might need some of the money sitting in the bank,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.880]   but that's where you come in and you could be very safe
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.400]   and feel very confident about having some of that
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.440]   in some sort of stable bond fund.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.160]   Perfectly responsible thing to do.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.060]   And by diversifying your approach,
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.120]   you can have access to the money
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.680]   from a diversity of sources.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.240]   So there are lots of securities,
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.200]   obvious ones, treasuries, T-bills,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.300]   but there are lots of securities
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.460]   that give you that stability and that safety.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.960]   The other thing to remember
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.480]   on the subject of treasuries or bonds,
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.920]   even individual bonds,
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.120]   is assume for a moment that you've covered yourself
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.320]   from a diversification need.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.560]   So let's ignore corporate bonds
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.200]   and let's just focus on treasuries.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.520]   You can set up for yourself
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   a laddered portfolio of treasuries
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.120]   that would meet your needs in that example
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.200]   that I described as a landlord.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.240]   You have a need to have significant amounts of cash on hand
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.280]   and you have a need to have amounts of cash available
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.360]   if you had some sort of significant problems.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360]   Well, you could set that up
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.400]   with a laddered treasury portfolio
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.600]   and you purchase a series of laddered treasury notes.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.700]   That portfolio can be established simply,
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.140]   inexpensively, and safely.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.700]   And you can have treasury notes
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.240]   that are regularly coming mature.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.460]   People often have a concern about treasuries
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.800]   that's related to interest rates.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.260]   We all can start from the fact or say,
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.860]   well, if interest rates go up, values go down, right?
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.740]   In bond investing, there's an inverse relationship
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.220]   between rates and values.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.760]   If rates go down, bond values go up.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.700]   But the key is for you in a situation
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.100]   like I've just described,
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.020]   there's no risk because you know,
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.940]   there's no risk of interest rates
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:23.020]   because you know what the overall value is
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.140]   and you're not investing in a fund.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.700]   In a bond fund, you have to deal with something
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.260]   called the duration of the portfolio,
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:33.500]   which is a measurement of when do these various bonds
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.300]   that are in the portfolio, when do they mature?
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.140]   And depending on the duration of the portfolio,
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.980]   you'll face more or less risk of prevailing interest rates.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:48.140]   So with a long-term duration portfolio,
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.300]   small changes of interest rates can have a significant effect
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.080]   on the value of the portfolio.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.840]   That may or may not be appropriate
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.580]   for your personal emergency fund
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.580]   'cause you might not want to have that amount of risk
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.980]   in terms of the fluctuating values.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:10.020]   The longer the term of the bond,
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.900]   the higher the fluctuation when interest rates change.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.980]   But you could still set up
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.340]   and you could still use treasuries
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.580]   in a small treasury portfolio, even as an individual,
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.460]   you could still use that as a component
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.740]   of your emergency fund.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.220]   Now, I don't know if that's worth doing for you,
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.880]   just an idea to say that don't ignore securities
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   as being useful for you in your emergency fund
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.180]   and in your emergency fund needs.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.020]   Another example would be insurance contracts.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.900]   I think insurance contracts,
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.500]   specifically cash value whole life insurance contracts,
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.220]   have a unique place and a unique value
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:50.040]   as part of an overall emergency fund approach.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.460]   That is one of the things that I most like
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:56.160]   about the personal whole life insurance contracts
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.020]   that I own for me and my family members.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.080]   I view them as a significant aspect
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.540]   of my emergency plans.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.120]   They have a few effective, useful things
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.960]   in the context of emergency funds that I particularly like.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.000]   Number one is they have high stability.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.240]   And here I'm talking about a traditional
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.340]   portfolio-based life insurance product,
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.140]   not a variable contract.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.100]   When you have a traditional
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.700]   portfolio-based life insurance contract,
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.640]   you have a life insurance contract that has values
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.280]   that are very, very stable.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.660]   They are contractually guaranteed to go up,
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.660]   and then depending on the type of contract that you have,
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.660]   they'll go up at differing amounts,
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.340]   but they're contractually guaranteed to go up.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.900]   I like that because it means
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.500]   I have a high stability of money.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:52.020]   I give up return in exchange for safety,
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:58.500]   but I have much more return in a life insurance contract
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.860]   than I do in a local bank account.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.020]   I have less access in a life insurance account
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.320]   than my local bank account.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.780]   But one of the unique factors of life insurance contracts
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.380]   is you have pretty good access.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.320]   Now, there's two sides to this coin.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.140]   Number one is you have to talk about the contractual access,
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.180]   the guaranteed access, depending on the company,
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.320]   and the practical access.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.660]   How is business actually done?
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.720]   The contractual access in many life insurance contracts
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.920]   with many companies is if you request a loan
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.940]   on your portfolio or to cash out a life insurance contract
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:36.400]   'cause you need the money and cash it out entirely,
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.400]   the insurance company can often have a contractual protection
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.340]   where they don't need to send that
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.800]   for up to about six months.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.360]   So there's a difference between contractual and practical.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.380]   In reality, if I need money,
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.840]   and I need money right away from my insurance contracts,
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.160]   I can have the money wired into my account
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.380]   in a day or two days from the time that I request the money.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:09.680]   So I really like a whole life insurance contract
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.160]   as being a component of emergency funds.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.880]   And the money that I have in whole life contracts,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   I mentally categorize it as primarily emergency funds.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.960]   Whole life contracts don't work well
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.800]   for short-term investment needs, in my opinion,
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.240]   in my experience, in my analysis.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.800]   I don't even love them for retirement planning,
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.120]   although they have a place.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.280]   I don't ever start with that.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   But I love them for giving me some form of safe,
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.060]   stable money that I can have easy access to,
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.640]   but I have decent return.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.300]   And I like the fact that with whole life contracts,
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.100]   my favorite thing is I get both of these things of access.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.680]   So with access, I talked about speed of access
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.760]   and ready access to large amounts,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.100]   but also restrictive access,
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.920]   kind of this double-edged sword,
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.600]   and I think both are valuable.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.060]   So number one, with life insurance contracts,
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.100]   I can have quick and speedy access to my money
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.120]   without anybody asking questions.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.000]   So if I want to take out a policy loan,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.240]   again, I can have the money wired directly into my account,
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.840]   or I can have a physical check FedExed to me
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   in a day or two under all normal circumstances.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.420]   I don't even remember what the contractual limits are
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.340]   in the contracts that I own,
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.820]   but I can have practical access to the money very quickly.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.020]   A day or two is very, very reasonable for emergencies.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.460]   And so that allows me to have a significant amount of money
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.080]   that's locked away in something that's safe, that goes up,
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.980]   that's protected from the claims of creditors in my state,
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.200]   and also that I can have quick access to,
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.600]   and a decent rate of return,
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.800]   a pretty decent rate of return for a safe, stable asset.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.920]   But on the flip side,
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.880]   because it's a little bit of a hassle,
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.360]   I have a little bit of restriction on the access.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.200]   And so I like that.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.520]   It puts a little distance between me and my money.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.880]   It makes me have to think twice.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.320]   Do I really want to get this money out?
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.920]   And that makes me happy.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.280]   I like both of those things.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.060]   I think life insurance contracts,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.540]   whole life and portfolio-based
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.500]   whole life insurance contracts actually fit
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.980]   this particular application really well.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.580]   I'm a big fan in this application.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.780]   One of the nice thing about whole life insurance contracts
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.620]   is you can have quick access to the money
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.380]   with no questions asked.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:38.740]   And again, if you need quick financing for something,
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.900]   you can do it with no questions asked,
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:45.300]   which is helpful in certain circumstances.
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.020]   Shop carefully in the world of life insurance.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.900]   Finally, we get to tangibles.
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.680]   That's my last aspect.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.980]   I think you should always consider tangibles
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:01.520]   in the context of emergency funds
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.540]   and emergency fund planning.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.880]   Now, a simple example would be tangibles
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.200]   such as precious metals.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   Precious metals have a tremendous usefulness
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.680]   in the context of emergency funds
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.640]   and in emergency fund planning.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.200]   If you want a compact store of wealth,
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.440]   I don't know of anything that's a more compact
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.440]   store of wealth than gold, gold coins.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.560]   You could put hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.800]   of gold coins in a coffee can.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.440]   I mean, it's crazy, especially if you're measuring
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.920]   the value in terms of US dollars, it's crazy.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.840]   And in terms of universal access to the money,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.840]   there is no currency that is so broadly spoken
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.760]   on a global basis as gold coins.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.840]   US dollars will get you out of a pinch
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.740]   just about anywhere in the world.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.400]   Frequently, I have found in traveling
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.160]   to little out of the way places that locals
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   and places I would have no clue existed.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.040]   Well, number one, I'll do a transaction with me
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.500]   in US dollars and we'll get great rates
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.360]   in US dollar exchanges.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.460]   There've been times in traveling,
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.960]   when you're traveling with a large group of people
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   in a place that's not an ordinary, normal tourist place,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.920]   and you can give a big old stack of US dollars
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.360]   to a local person and they'll come back
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.760]   with a nice stack of local currency.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.120]   So US dollars are pretty ubiquitous all around the world.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.440]   But there are places in the world
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.040]   where US dollars don't speak and they don't work,
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.440]   either because they're barred,
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.140]   and it's considered to be a black market transaction
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.760]   to do things in dollars, i.e. Venezuela,
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.160]   or because they're just simply not accepted
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.780]   in the local economy.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.280]   But I don't believe there's any place in the world
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.760]   that you can't take a gold coin
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.680]   to a local experienced merchant,
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.720]   or to a local pawn shop, or to a local banker,
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.080]   or to a local coin dealer.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.120]   I don't think there's anywhere in the world
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.240]   that you can't take a gold coin
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.220]   and come out with a stack of cash.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.160]   And once you get outside of the US,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.600]   it's hard to spend a gold coin in the United States.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.000]   It's really hard.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.600]   But there are a whole lot of markets in the world
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.040]   where you walk in with a gold or silver coin
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.160]   and you can work a very reasonable deal
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.160]   for a transaction that you need.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.920]   So when it comes down to something like emergency cash,
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.640]   it's hard to get better than a gold coin,
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.780]   or if you have the space, silver coins.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.900]   The other aspect of tangibles
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.140]   and how they apply to your emergency
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.380]   and your emergency planning
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:48.720]   is oftentimes you need to have the tangibles
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.820]   in order to stave off the emergency.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.900]   Here in South Florida,
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.060]   we just passed through Hurricane Irma.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.260]   I'm recording this on September 12, 2017.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.020]   And the frenzy of Hurricane Irma
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.300]   was rather obvious to see,
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:06.060]   it just, I had a front row seat to it.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.020]   And last week I recorded these shows on Hurricane Harvey.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.140]   I talked about price fixing laws,
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.540]   aka anti-price gouging laws.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.820]   And then a week later,
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.660]   unexpectedly I had a fresh front row seat
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.380]   at a whole, watching the whole thing play out
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.580]   right here where I live in South Florida.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.180]   What happens when there's an emergency,
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.440]   such as a hurricane,
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.400]   is the economy changes.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:33.620]   So there are price fixing laws
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:38.620]   that make it illegal to charge higher prices for items.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.140]   And what actually happens
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.260]   in the face of the price fixing laws,
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:46.060]   that instead of changing prices,
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.520]   the companies and the merchants
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.300]   that sell the goods and services,
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.980]   they change the quantities.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.460]   And so bottled water,
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.660]   two weeks before the hurricane,
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.820]   you could buy practically unlimited amounts
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.820]   of bottled water at my local Costco.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.460]   Best price on bottled water,
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.340]   Kirkland brand bottled water works great.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.980]   You could buy practically unlimited quantities.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.360]   You could load up a whole cart with a bunch of it.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.820]   But then as soon as the emergency started
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:20.700]   and the forecast turned it straight to South Florida,
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.260]   so it's the day after Labor Day,
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:27.220]   immediately the Costco put up a five limit per person,
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:31.240]   per water rationing system.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.840]   So now you could only buy five cases of bottled water.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.260]   Then that was quickly sold out.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:40.980]   The next day I came back and it was two cases per person.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:42.740]   And in later transactions,
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:43.580]   there was a friend of mine
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:44.940]   who I was helping with some things.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.940]   And I actually wound up back at the Costco again,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.380]   day or two before the,
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.540]   two days before the,
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.860]   a day before they closed for the hurricane,
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.620]   kind of just basically last minute.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.420]   And they were so strict on their rationing policy
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.740]   that they would not even literally
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:02.840]   even put four cases in my cart,
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.480]   even though I was shopping with my friend
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.060]   who was on a different aisle.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.720]   Said, no, he has to be here with his own cart.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.880]   Only two cases per member.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.720]   So what happens?
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720]   Well, my point here is not to reiterate
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.200]   my comments on price fixing laws.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.160]   My point is to focus on the fact
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.180]   that there are times when the money doesn't work.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:27.460]   Now that was a very minor emergency.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.140]   There was still plenty of bottled water.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.300]   If you just went to another store
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.560]   and you could go to six stores
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.820]   and buy two cases at each store and come back, sort of.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.660]   Most of the stores,
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:37.080]   even the big ones that were very focused,
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:37.920]   they did sell out,
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.060]   but they usually were resupplied the next morning.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.720]   Very impressed with the way the merchants
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.180]   hustled to resupply.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.820]   Very impressive.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.700]   But the money didn't work.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.980]   Didn't matter how much money I had.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.420]   I could buy thousands of cases of bottled water.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.840]   The bottled water wasn't available.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.820]   So sometimes you need to think about the item
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.120]   that would be needed in an emergency
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.100]   and get the item first.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.540]   Was on YouTube the other day.
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.880]   I was watching the Yankee Marshalls channel
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.580]   and he had done a video
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:13.580]   and the question that was written into him was,
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.040]   "What kind of gun can I buy for self-protection
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.400]   "for under $200?"
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.260]   And the scenario that was described to him
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.980]   in a letter by one of his viewers,
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:28.620]   the viewer was a 15-year-old younger brother
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:33.540]   of a young lady who was married to an abusive husband.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.340]   And there had been a long history of physical abuse
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:42.340]   and her husband had actually been convicted of abuse.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.540]   He had been sent to prison
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.100]   and then he was getting out of prison
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.580]   and he had vowed to family and friends,
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.980]   getting out of prison early,
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.940]   and he had vowed to family and friends
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.780]   that he was going to go and he was going to kill her.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.540]   He was gonna go and kill his wife.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:00.820]   Now this lady had thought she had more time
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.060]   to plan for her physical safety
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.460]   because his release date
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.020]   was supposed to be several months later,
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:10.740]   but he was being released early.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:14.180]   And so now she was in a bind.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.020]   She needed to get a gun for self-protection,
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.700]   but she only had about $200 saved.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.820]   And the question was, to the Yankee Marshall,
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:23.780]   you can go watch the video
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:26.420]   and it's on his channel, Yankee Marshall.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:31.180]   The question to him was, what kind of gun should she get?
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.060]   When I viewed the video,
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.220]   I was just thinking about this show
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.340]   because I knew I was gonna do it.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.140]   And how vivid of an example to say
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.220]   that sometimes you face an emergency
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.980]   and what you need is not the money.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:49.180]   What you need is the thing.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.140]   Now in the case of this woman,
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.620]   thankfully she has enough time
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:58.220]   where she can go and she can get,
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.100]   she had been doing training.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:02.940]   I think she had gotten a permit, a carry permit,
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.660]   but she has the time where she can go and still
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:09.520]   and get the gun and she has enough time to do it.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.980]   But what it faces, if she doesn't have a permit,
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.940]   in Florida they have mandatory waiting laws
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.060]   where you need to buy a gun and you can't get one.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:17.880]   You gotta wait.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.460]   I can't remember how long it is.
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:22.300]   But there's a mandatory minimum amount of time.
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.940]   And so picture yourself as a woman
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.300]   and your abusive husband has sworn
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.740]   he's gonna come and kill you
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.300]   and you need a gun to protect yourself.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.260]   You don't have anybody that you can do
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.740]   and the money doesn't work.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.020]   Money doesn't work in that situation.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:41.680]   You can't get the gun 'cause there's a waiting law.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.020]   And so you've gotta have already had the thing that you need.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.740]   So if you anticipate different emergencies,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.820]   you can think about this and you can consider
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.660]   what is the thing that I would need in the emergency?
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.060]   And let me square that away first.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.620]   To get out of the hurricane zone, I'm gonna need gasoline.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:03.380]   And yes, I can save the money to buy the gasoline,
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.380]   but maybe what I should do is consider the fact
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.980]   that the gasoline's not gonna be available.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.420]   And so let me grab a couple of five-gallon cans
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.260]   and put them out on my back porch
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.340]   or tuck them away in the back shed or the back garage
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.500]   so at least I can fill up my tank and get out of town
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.580]   if there's a hurricane coming.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.700]   Or let me go ahead and grab some cases of water now
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.900]   while it's abundant so at least I have some water
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.440]   and some batteries if there's a hurricane coming.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.900]   Same thing with food.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.900]   My wife and I have always tried to maintain a deep pantry,
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.580]   as deep as possible.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.420]   Well, I've lived on a highly fluctuating variable income
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.940]   for practically all of my adult life.
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.820]   And there were a lot of times
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.980]   where when my income was very small
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.620]   and it would be small for extended periods of time,
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.900]   where I'd find myself taking a great amount of comfort
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.900]   of the fact that we didn't have to go to the grocery store.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.700]   We just had enough food in the pantry.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.240]   We didn't have to go to the grocery store.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.620]   I've read all kinds of accounts of people
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.340]   who lost their job and the fact that they had food saved
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.640]   was what got them through.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:18.020]   So the point is, don't ignore the tangibles
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.260]   that you would need in an emergency.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.260]   Make sure that you have them.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.500]   And you may find them to be very, very helpful.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.380]   It really just struck hard to me,
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.280]   watching, and it's still ongoing,
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.340]   just watching the aftermath of what's happening
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.640]   in some of the Caribbean islands
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.740]   in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.980]   There was a big article in the New York Times yesterday
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.420]   about St. Martin, just the total devastation there.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.940]   And it just reinforced again to me
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.680]   the importance of these comments that I'm making
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.860]   on thinking ahead about the tangibles
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.920]   and the things that you would need
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.280]   and preparing for them
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.740]   because you can't do everything with money.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.300]   One thing I try to do when I travel
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.420]   is I always try to make sure that I have some water with me.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:11.100]   And because the Transportation Security Administration
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:16.100]   has decided that water is a very dangerous substance
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:20.020]   to passengers, they've decided that it's fine
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.860]   to bring a container,
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.460]   but you can't bring the container full of water.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.460]   So whenever I travel, I always try to make sure
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.340]   that I have a container for water.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.300]   And this is partly because I'm offended
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.620]   at the idea of paying $5 for a bottle of water
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:35.060]   in an airport, my frugal, thrifty ways.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.620]   And partly just because of having been in circumstances
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.020]   where you're sitting on a plane
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.180]   and you're sitting on the tarmac
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:43.500]   and all of a sudden you're there for a long time
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.420]   and they can't get up,
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.740]   the flight attendants can't get up and serve water,
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.460]   but you're stuck there with a two and a half hour delay.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.260]   And if you don't plan ahead and have your own water,
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.340]   you're sunk.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:53.260]   Which incidentally, on the subject of carrying water,
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:58.260]   have you ever noticed that the great threat of water
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:01.740]   and the idea that water is a bomb,
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.460]   you know, it's a huge threat, of course.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.660]   And so what we do is we take the most crowded,
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:08.980]   packed place in the airport
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:11.340]   where there are lots of people close together,
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.060]   standing still, and we use a secure fixed position
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.420]   'cause the security gates don't move.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.540]   And then we say,
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.660]   well, let's drop all of these potential bombs
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:25.900]   into this container right here by these lines of people
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:29.980]   where, of course, they'll be the safest 'cause lines of,
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.260]   I digress, but you get my point.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.260]   Such a stupid approach.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.500]   The threat of your bottle of water,
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.980]   so let's keep that threat right here
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.460]   and just have you toss it in the trash can
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.420]   'cause you can't take a swig
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.540]   and take it through the machine.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.780]   So let's toss it in the trash can
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.780]   right next to these 85 people lined up
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.740]   or 185 people lined up who are just perfect targets for us.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:56.180]   Forgive me, I lose my self-control sometimes.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.860]   So I try to take water with me.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.500]   And it's good to have a container of water.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.140]   You travel enough in places
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.620]   where you can't drink the water from the tap.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.180]   And one of the first things that you do
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.260]   when you get into such a place,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.780]   you should set aside for yourself a little stash of water.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.940]   Make sure that you have enough water
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:11.780]   so you don't go thirsty.
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:12.720]   It's bad for your health.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.180]   It's bad for your ability to absorb
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.500]   and assimilate the local food.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.060]   Just make sure that you have water.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:20.860]   And then a good backup consideration
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.460]   is make sure that you carry a water filter.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.300]   There are all kinds of wonderful
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:26.060]   little portable water filters that you can travel with.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:29.100]   You can travel with their integrated in the bottle, et cetera.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.740]   That stuff can save you from a bad case
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.180]   of the Katmandu quick step
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:37.620]   just simply by taking a few precautions.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.040]   Or it can save your life.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.620]   When there's a hurricane afoot
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.100]   and you're stuck on a Caribbean island,
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.660]   you can't get off.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:49.300]   And all of a sudden, Hurricane Irma roars over your head.
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.700]   So read the news,
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.180]   read the article in the New York Times yesterday,
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:56.660]   and pay attention to the fact
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:01.580]   that money doesn't buy you out of every emergency.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.140]   Sometimes you got to make sure
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.160]   that you've made provisions other than money.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.340]   I want to close with two final comments.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:16.340]   Number one is pay attention to your insurance contracts.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:19.980]   I briefly mentioned insurance contracts a little while ago
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.900]   in the context of talking about whole life insurance
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.740]   as being an appropriate place for you
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:27.740]   to maintain some of your emergency funds.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:30.220]   But pay attention to the fact
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:35.220]   that if you can have an emergency from something,
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.020]   you should seriously consider insuring yourself
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.260]   against the emergency.
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.340]   You shouldn't always do it.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.420]   There are tons of things that people buy insurance from
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.260]   that I don't think are a good solution,
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.340]   or at least not a good solution
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:50.700]   once you've accumulated some money.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.480]   And one of the major benefits
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.460]   of accumulating emergency funds
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.960]   is you can forego insurance contracts
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.660]   that other people need to pay for.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.620]   If you have $10,000 in an emergency fund,
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:08.260]   you don't need insurance on your cell phone,
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:10.820]   you don't need insurance on your TV,
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.920]   and you probably don't need comprehensive insurance
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.440]   on your $2,000 car.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.500]   You can self-insure for the cell phone,
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.640]   and if you can't get a different phone,
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.940]   although I have a soft spot for expensive phones
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.340]   because I realize they can be very productive.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:29.540]   You can self-insure against the TV.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   If you can't, you shouldn't have bought the TV.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.420]   And you can self-insure against the loss of the car.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.820]   It's more efficient for you when you're driving a cheap car
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:38.180]   to keep the money in cash and protect yourself
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.260]   and just maintain the ability to go buy another car.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.660]   But there are a lot of things
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.840]   that if you face an emergency,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.460]   you need to calculate that risk.
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.020]   Go back to that real estate investor I described
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.500]   where you might need $200,000 saved up.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.060]   Better make sure that's a comfortable number.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.660]   If not, you need to adjust your insurance contracts.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:01.400]   So always pay attention to insurance.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.340]   Do it thoughtfully, rationally, and logically,
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:09.900]   but don't depend always on emergency funds.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.820]   It's a two-way street.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.100]   Don't buy insurance for everything
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.540]   when you can self-insure
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:17.260]   and keep that risk yourself with your funds.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.280]   And don't put everything on funds
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.060]   when you can insure a risk away.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.200]   Don't plan exclusively on your emergency fund
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.800]   when you can insure a risk away.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:30.340]   Final comment I wanna make is simply this.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.980]   I've heard it said,
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.820]   if money solves your problems,
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.820]   you don't really have a,
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.660]   what was it?
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:38.480]   I don't know how it was said.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.540]   If money solves your problem, you don't have an emergency.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:44.220]   It sounds a little cold and a little cavalier sometimes.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.940]   So especially it sounds cold and cavalier
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.860]   if somebody has lost their house,
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:50.700]   or they're out of money,
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.560]   or they ruined their car and all that stuff.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.740]   But I really, although I don't,
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.940]   I can't, haven't thought of a poetic and elegant way
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.820]   to convey the words.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:06.380]   I really am increasingly convinced of the truth,
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:10.740]   that if you have a problem that can be solved with money,
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.620]   a lot of times it's not really all that big of a problem
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.640]   in the grand scheme of things.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.020]   Now, let's not be stupid and ignorant of the fact
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:21.260]   that problems are caused,
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.460]   and they can be fixed by money.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.300]   And money problems are real problems.
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.140]   They affect people every day.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.660]   I'm here to try to help solve some of your money problems.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.460]   But when you're facing an emergency,
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.220]   just always recognize,
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:34.020]   your problem can be solved with money.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.700]   In many ways, it's not as big of a problem
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.860]   as some other people's.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.900]   So do the planning now, do the preparation now.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.140]   If you don't have an emergency fund, get saving.
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:47.380]   And if you are someone who is in part A,
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:49.980]   you don't have a thousand bucks stashed in your house
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.300]   and 10,000 bucks stashed in the bank
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.020]   that's at your savings account at your local bank,
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.300]   right next to your checking account.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.260]   If you don't have that, ignore all of part B here
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.780]   in an hour and 30 minutes of Joshua
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.340]   talking about the intricate ways of working out access
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:06.100]   and rate of return and safety
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.700]   and all these weird scenarios that I've come up with.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:12.140]   Just go back and put in place part A.
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.540]   Put a thousand bucks in your house,
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.700]   put 10,000 bucks in your bank account,
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.580]   and then come back and listen.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.780]   And for those of you who have heard part B
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.020]   and thought about it,
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.060]   I just encourage you, consider your actual scenarios
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.940]   and consider actual emergencies.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.340]   When I read the news, I always read
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:32.020]   with reading about the emergencies that someone else faces
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.540]   and I always think, okay, Joshua, how do you plan for this?
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.780]   Feel that responsibility to help you plan for it,
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.180]   you, my listener,
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.940]   and I feel the responsibility to plan for it myself.
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.220]   So think it through.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.340]   I think if you apply that thinking process,
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.340]   consistently thinking through and planning for things,
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.580]   I think you'll start to come up
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.540]   with an appropriate plan for yourself.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.260]   Please, there are two shows,
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.780]   and I don't have internet right now,
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.940]   so I can't look up the number
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.020]   because the easiest way is to look them up on my site.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.460]   So I can't remember the name of them.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.900]   But it is a show on insurance strategies.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.180]   I think if you just search the website
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:11.100]   for insurance strategy, you can find it.
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.660]   And you can find my discussion of the types of risk
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.780]   and what's the most sensible way to deal with certain risks.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.140]   That's important.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.580]   And the second show,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:23.100]   I just blanked on this.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.900]   Oh, the second show I want you to think about
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.300]   is the concept of scale.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.340]   The show that I did on the concept of scale.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.480]   Remember, everything in financial planning
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.380]   is a matter of scale.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.380]   That's what I'm expressing
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.420]   when I talk about part A and part B.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.780]   If you don't have $1,000 of cash,
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.100]   don't go and try to figure out how do I buy gold coins.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:43.920]   It's silly.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.420]   If you don't have $10,000 of cash in the bank,
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.820]   don't figure out how do I go and buy gold coins.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.940]   Start with simple, normal, practical things.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.720]   And then adjust according to scale.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.500]   Pay attention to your situation
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.700]   and analyze the place that you are in your current scale.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.140]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.540]   I'll get this out to you as soon as I can.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:10.740]   I gotta go find a working internet connection to do it.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.260]   And then I gotta finish recovering
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.900]   and get back on track here from Irma.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.280]   Appreciate all of you who have given us good well wishes.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.500]   I released, hopefully concurrently with the show,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.700]   I released to you an audio file with a report on that.
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.300]   We are well and everyone is well.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.900]   And I'll be back with you as soon as I can
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.420]   and try to get back here on the normal schedule
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.580]   as soon as I'm able to.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.980]   Deal with our emergencies.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.820]   Thank you all for listening
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.660]   and I'll be back with you very soon.
