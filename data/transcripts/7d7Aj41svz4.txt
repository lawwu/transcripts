[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   All right, let's see here.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.620]   We've got a written question.
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.440]   This one's from Overthinker.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.820]   Overthinker says, "What do you think about overthinking?
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240]   "And how do you deal with or recommend dealing with it?
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.760]   "This is a general problem I face,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300]   "and I have always had, but never had a way of dealing with.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900]   "I have this as far as career job decisions are concerned,
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.180]   "certain life decisions as well,
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820]   "and by overthinking and overanalyzing
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.260]   "the potential options, I end up in a scenario
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.720]   "where I'm more confused than before.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   "How do you recommend dealing with this?
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   "Thank you."
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.600]   All right, well, Overthinker, typically the issue,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.280]   and this is a common problem,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.320]   but typically the issue at stake with this problem
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.240]   is that you're stuck in the mental schema
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.840]   of a right-wrong decision binary.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   So that the mental framework you're using
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.480]   when thinking about decisions is that there is
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   a right decision and multiple wrong decisions.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.300]   If you can find a right decision,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.540]   there is great rewards to it.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.500]   If you miss it and end up on a wrong decision,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.820]   there is great punishment.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.080]   Now, when you have the stakes of a binary,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.060]   you are really gonna worry about that decision
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.480]   because I don't wanna miss the right decision here.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.220]   It could lead to quite a bit of hardship if I get it wrong.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.940]   That is fertile ground for growing overthinking.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.160]   So the big shift in mental frame
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.340]   that's gonna help you here is move away from this idea
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.120]   that there's right and wrong decisions,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.580]   and your goal is to not mess up
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.540]   and accidentally do the wrong instead of the right.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.160]   In many different areas where there's big decisions to make,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.480]   there are many different ways forward
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.220]   that are completely compatible with reward or goodness
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.500]   or whatever it is that you're looking to maximize.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.200]   What matters much more than the decision
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.900]   is what you do once you make it.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.120]   Now, where this is made really clear
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.340]   is in career decisions, which you mentioned there.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.840]   We talked about in an earlier question,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   which I wrote a whole book about,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.900]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.060]   So let's focus on that briefly.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.800]   Zoom in on that briefly here for a second.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.140]   One of the big ideas in that book,
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.240]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.480]   is that people often fell
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.760]   into this right-wrong binary decision frame
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.360]   when it came to career choices.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.520]   There's a right job for me
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   that matches some sort of magical fairy tale
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   inborn passion for that job.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.020]   If I find that job, I'll be happy.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.560]   If I miss it, I'll be miserable.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   So people obsess over what job am I going to do.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.380]   And as I argued in "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.900]   the decision of what job you do
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.460]   is actually in some sense of minor importance.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.820]   You're not wired for one particular pursuit.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.860]   You're not wired to be the social media brand manager
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.260]   for a digital media consultancy.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.020]   There's no particular job that happens to be around
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.380]   in the 21st century knowledge economy
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.460]   that you have to do because of your DNA.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.140]   And if you miss it, you'll be unhappy.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.700]   The reality is there's probably many, many different jobs
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   that could be the foundation
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.480]   of a passionate, fulfilling career.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.400]   So just choose one that seems reasonable.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.520]   Great.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.640]   What matters is what you do next.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.320]   And that's where we get into career capital theory.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.860]   That's where we get into becoming so good
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.240]   you can't be ignored.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.420]   Using that unambiguous skill as leverage
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.760]   to shape your job towards things,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.480]   towards resonate and away from things that don't,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   eventually arriving at an ideal lifestyle.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.220]   The choice of job, eh.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.640]   What you do once you make the choice,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.120]   oh yeah, that matters.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.800]   So we can extend that to almost any major decision.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.040]   Here's what I would ask.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.080]   Do I have evidence that this particular decision
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.520]   opens up good options for me that will move me closer
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.000]   to the properties of my desired lifestyle?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.900]   If the answer is yes, are there other options
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.020]   which are also tractable
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.020]   that would be demonstrably more successful
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.200]   at moving me towards properties
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.100]   compatible with my ideal lifestyle?
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.240]   If the answer to that is no, so yes, no,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.520]   then great, go ahead.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.720]   So this seems good, I'll simplify the language here.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.760]   This seems good, it opens up cool opportunities,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.620]   it leads me in a direction I could imagine
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.040]   constructing a good deep life around that.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   And there's not some obvious alternative that's way better.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.700]   I don't care if there's a lot of alternatives
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.540]   that are similar.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.600]   There's not one that is obviously way better.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.080]   Good, go for it, commit.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.000]   And there might be six different options that satisfy this.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.200]   Flip a, roll a six sided die, I don't care.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.920]   Choose something that seems good, opens up opportunities.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.420]   There's not some obviously much better answer.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.180]   The interesting thing is then what you do next,
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.820]   which is once you've made the choice,
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   all right, now what do I wanna do?
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.460]   I've chosen this job, I've decided to get married,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.000]   I've decided to have kids, I've decided to move
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.220]   to this completely different environment.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.640]   Great, you've made the decision.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.660]   How now do you build a life around that decision
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.460]   that leverages and maximizes what's good about it,
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.540]   sidesteps to potential traps,
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.740]   that allows you to extract from it
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.260]   all of the possibilities for a deeper life
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.960]   for that ideal lifestyle.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.920]   So that's the frame shift.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.100]   The decision is easy.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.020]   Don't make an obviously bad choice,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.420]   but if something seems reasonable, that's good enough.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.020]   Put more energy into what you do next.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.360]   (upbeat music)
