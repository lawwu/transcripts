[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   So if I think about how do I use like let's say a chat GPT,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.160]   it's certainly for idea generation.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.060]   It often isn't the last place I look.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.400]   Again, I still think of something like a broad search engine
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.500]   like chat GPT or perplexity as the starting point.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.520]   In some cases it helps me understand things, right?
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.520]   So they'll like explain it to me like I'm five
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.860]   or sometimes in a character like that's helpful as well.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.640]   One thing that I think is underrated for many of these LLMs
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640]   is the ability to take really messy information,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.560]   whether it's your notes, whether it's a spreadsheet
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   that you haven't perfectly set up
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.320]   and just clean it up for you.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.480]   So again, I think it's like really good for that base layer,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.360]   at least the broad LLMs.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.380]   But again, I think that where the LLMs get really interesting
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.840]   are when they're more curated
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100]   or people have used the APIs for more curated action.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.560]   I think it's actually depending on what you're looking to do
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.640]   a lot more helpful than the broad based LLMs.
