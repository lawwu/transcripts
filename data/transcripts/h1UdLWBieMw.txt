[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   The title of this seminar is "Things that Seminary Cannot Teach You," subtitled "The
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.920]   Intangible Qualities or Intangible Prerequisites Necessary for Ministry Usefulness."
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.160]   And I had the opportunity to give a very similar message in a chapel service at the Master
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.840]   Seminary last semester.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.880]   And so some of this, as you hear it, you'll recognize that it's aimed at men training
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   for ministry, but I think the import of the principles also apply to men who are currently
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.840]   in ministry.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   And so my hope and my prayer this afternoon is that this will be an encouragement to you
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   to press on in faithfulness, even as I encouraged our seminary students last fall to press on
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.680]   in faithfulness as they prepare for a lifetime of doing what you men are already doing.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.440]   And I'm certainly grateful for your faithfulness, grateful for the encouragement that it is
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.420]   to have 5,000 pastors descend on this campus and to just see the zeal and vigor for serving
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.400]   the Lord in each of your faces.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.000]   And so even in this breakout session, just such an encouragement to have you men here.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.720]   I'd like to open us in a word of prayer, and then we're going to jump right in.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.280]   Heavenly Father, we give You thanks for Your many blessings, and even the rain that we're
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.940]   experiencing this afternoon, we recognize is a sign of Your provision and a reminder
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.900]   that all that we enjoy and all that we need, even the breath that we breathe, is a gift
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   from You.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.840]   Father, I'm grateful for these men.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.940]   I'm grateful for their faithfulness, for their endurance, for their eagerness to serve You
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.860]   and to represent You as they preach Your Word and shepherd Your people.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.020]   And I pray that this entire week would be a great encouragement to each of them.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.500]   I know that them being here is a great encouragement to us, and we just celebrate the fact that
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.960]   all of this is a gift of Your grace, that we would be counted worthy to be saved by
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.660]   You through the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then counted as those who would be appointed
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.620]   to Your service in this way.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.140]   What a privilege.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.340]   And we ask that You would renew in our hearts the joy of what it means to serve You faithfully.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.420]   We pray this in the name of Christ, our Savior.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.420]   Amen.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.300]   All right, so given our topic this afternoon, I am going to spend quite a bit of time talking
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.020]   about seminary education, and I'm going to talk a little bit about what I will call the
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.900]   tangibles of seminary education and then the intangibles of seminary education.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.420]   Obviously, this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart as someone who's on the faculty
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.820]   here at the Master's Seminary.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.100]   I have the privilege of serving as the Executive Vice President and Provost.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.900]   And so stewarding seminary education is something that our faculty thinks about frequently.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.060]   It's a constant thought on our minds, because we recognize that if James 3:1 is true, that
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.540]   let not many of you become teachers, knowing that as such you will receive a stricter judgment.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.020]   If that's true for the teachers, how much more so is it true for the teachers of the
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.200]   teachers?
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.820]   And so we take our calling, our stewardship, our responsibility before the Lord very, very
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.980]   seriously.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.620]   And when we think about seminary education and specifically the tangible side of it,
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.320]   and I'll explain what I mean by that in a little bit, we focus on the content of what
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.860]   we give to men in the classroom.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.980]   We focus on things like sound doctrine and apologetics and evangelism.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.420]   We focus on hermeneutics and homiletics, on preaching and delivery.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.900]   All of these things, for lack of a better word, that can be communicated either through
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.860]   content that is given to them in a classroom setting or that which can be practiced in
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.980]   some sort of lab or ministry field experience.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.000]   But there's another category that we're looking for in the men who come through the
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.620]   master's seminary, and it's what I call the intangible qualities that we're going
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.980]   to talk about this afternoon.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.620]   These are things that cannot be taught in a classroom, but they are essential to ministry
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.800]   effectiveness.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.160]   And I'm going to highlight three of those as we go through this material this afternoon,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.580]   and we'll get to those in just a moment.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.680]   When we think about seminary education, the history of seminary education, obviously we
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.040]   could go many, many centuries back into church history.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.000]   Some examples that come to my mind would be John Calvin in Geneva who, in June of 1559,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.280]   dedicated a building to the academy there in Geneva, known as the Geneva Academy.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.240]   And it was there that John Calvin, along with Theodore Beza and others who were part of
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.220]   that movement in Geneva, trained up not only university students but also future pastors.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.040]   And men would come from all around Europe, from Roman Catholic-controlled nations.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   They would come to Geneva, they would be trained, and they would be sent back.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   And that school even earned itself the reputation of being the school of death, known for that
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.520]   because, not because it was deadly difficult, though seminary sometimes is, but instead
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.680]   because after men were trained and sent back to those countries from which they had come,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.120]   many experienced imprisonment, persecution, torture, and sometimes even martyrdom for
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.780]   the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.380]   We could fast-forward in church history a little bit to the time of Charles Spurgeon
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.540]   in the mid-19th century.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.780]   It was in 1855 that Spurgeon began meeting with a man in his congregation who wanted
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.740]   to learn systematic theology.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.580]   And those meetings went so well that soon many others were meeting with Spurgeon, and
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.580]   just nine years later, in 1864, he had over a hundred students who were meeting in what
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.980]   was called Spurgeon's Pastors College.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.900]   By the time Charles Spurgeon died, more than 900 men had been trained, and even though
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.820]   Spurgeon himself never left Europe, he never preached outside of Europe, the 900 men whom
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:08.460]   he trained took his doctrine, which is really just biblical doctrine, and his style of preaching,
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.120]   preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, all around the globe.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.100]   We could look for other examples in church history.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.320]   We could go back to some of the early catechetical schools, even among the church fathers, but
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.700]   I believe that there is a precedent for seminary education even in the New Testament itself,
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:37.780]   that the history of seminary training goes all the way back to the New Testament, and
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.260]   I'd like to show that to you as we get started this afternoon by looking at a passage from
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.280]   the book of Acts in Acts chapter 19.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.740]   So we're going to start in Acts chapter 19, and then we'll eventually make our way to
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.780]   the book of 2 Timothy, but I want to start in Acts chapter 19.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:07.300]   This is Paul's third missionary journey, and in Acts chapter 19, Luke records Paul's time
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300]   in Ephesus.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.700]   He actually spends roughly three years in Ephesus, and for a significant portion of
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   that time, Paul was engaged in pastoral training, and I think this is significant.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:31.780]   It almost seems parenthetical to Luke's thought in verses 8 through 10, but I find in this
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.740]   parenthetical section a precedent for seminary education.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:46.300]   Verse 8 of Acts chapter 19, Paul entered the synagogue, and he continued speaking out boldly
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.980]   for three months, and he was reasoning, and he was persuading them about the kingdom of
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   God.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.820]   And then verse 9, "But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.940]   the way before the people, he withdrew from them and took the disciples away with him,
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.020]   reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.500]   And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   Lord, both Jews and Greeks."
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:29.900]   Again, almost a parenthetical statement by Luke talking about Paul's time in Ephesus,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.340]   and yet what do we see Paul doing here?
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.100]   So he enters into the synagogue, as of course was his custom.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:43.100]   He preaches messages from the Old Testament Scriptures that would have convinced the Jewish
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:48.360]   listeners in that congregation that Jesus is the Messiah, and of course that pointed
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.860]   to the reality of the gospel, that he was crucified, buried, and rose again the third
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.860]   day.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.660]   I think if we look at Acts 13 and other places in Acts, we can get a sense of exactly what
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:06.760]   Paul was teaching in the synagogue when he was declaring to them the kingdom of God.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.820]   That took place, as Luke records here, for three months, and then after there was resistance,
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.940]   Paul decided that the hostility had reached a point at which it was no longer profitable
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.820]   for him to continue, and what did he do?
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.860]   He withdrew with the disciples, those who had embraced the Lord Jesus Christ in saving
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:36.380]   faith, and he met with them in a lecture hall there in Ephesus daily, Luke says, for a period
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.660]   of two years.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.820]   Now we don't know who Tyrannus was.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:49.300]   Most commentators think that he was a local teacher of probably rhetoric, and we don't
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:55.860]   know exactly how Paul gained use of the lecture hall that Tyrannus normally occupied.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.140]   It's quite possible, and this is what most commentators think, that Tyrannus would have
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.380]   used the lecture hall in the early morning when it was cool, and in the evening when
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.900]   again the temperature was cool, but the lecture hall would have sat empty in the warm hours
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.900]   of the day.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:18.100]   And in fact, there is a 4th century manuscript, which I realize is not authoritative because
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.860]   it's quite removed, but in this 4th century manuscript, there's a scribal note, specifically
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:30.380]   the scribal notes, what's not authoritative, and that scribal note says that Paul met with
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:36.400]   the disciples in the school of Tyrannus from the 5th hour of the day to the 10th hour of
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.860]   the day.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.380]   The Roman day started at 6 a.m., so the 5th hour of the day would have been 11 a.m., and
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:49.500]   the 10th hour of the day, 4 p.m., which fits with the idea that Paul perhaps met with the
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:57.140]   disciples there in the school of Tyrannus in Ephesus in the noon and early afternoon
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:04.500]   hours when the lecture hall was not normally needed because the rest of the city was experiencing
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.240]   their sort of siesta time during the warm hours of the day.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.300]   If that is at all accurate, that means that Paul spent roughly 5 hours a day, probably
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:24.020]   six days a week for a period of two years instructing in all things related to the kingdom
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.540]   of God, theology, sound doctrine, all of those categories, he instructed the disciples for
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.800]   a period of two years.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.820]   If you just do the simple math on that, 52 weeks in a year, let's say 50 weeks in a year,
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.140]   six hours a day, excuse me, five hours a day, six days a week, that's 30 hours a week, 50
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:53.020]   weeks, 1,500 hours a year, that's roughly 3,000 hours of instruction that potentially
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.820]   Paul invested in these students in Ephesus during his third missionary journey.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.060]   Now, again, the school of Tyrannus is not where the church met.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:11.820]   The church met elsewhere in Ephesus, so you have really a precedent for seminary education
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:18.700]   where you have Paul meeting with students on a regular basis in a setting that's outside
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:24.980]   of but connected to the local church in which he is imparting to them sound doctrine over
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.860]   this period of time.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:34.740]   And you'll notice the result of this, then, is verse 10, "As a result of Paul's instruction
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:41.300]   of these students in this training center, all of Asia," a reference to Asia Minor, so
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:48.340]   modern-day Turkey, "But all of Asia heard the gospel, the word of the Lord, both Jews
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.620]   and Greeks."
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.060]   And again, most commentators believe that as a result of Paul's training in Ephesus
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:04.100]   during his third missionary journey, this would have been 55, 56 AD, that the other
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:10.140]   churches of the seven churches of Revelation were planted as a result of this.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.620]   And even the church in Colossae, you remember Epaphras in the church of Colossae, that Paul
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:23.100]   had never been to Colossae, and yet Epaphras, he knew Epaphras, Epaphras was Paul's disciple,
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.060]   there was Epaphras trained, most commentators believe he was trained here at the school
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.660]   of Tyrannus under Paul's tutelage in Ephesus, and then he went and planted the church in
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.980]   Colossae.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:42.980]   And that's likely true of the churches that John will later write letters to in the book
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.660]   of Revelation, obviously Ephesus being one of those seven churches.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:56.140]   So you see here in Acts 19, again, a prototype, a precedent for pastoral training where Paul
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.040]   is investing himself daily in these disciples, and the result of this is that they're going
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:09.300]   out throughout Asia Minor and they're planting churches throughout that part of the world,
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:19.940]   and the impact is incalculable in terms of the impact that these men trained by Paul
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.300]   had as they took the gospel throughout that part of the world.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:32.380]   Now with that kind of as just a starting point, we see Paul at the end of Acts 19, there's
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.140]   a riot in Ephesus, you're familiar with that story, and then Acts 20, Paul leaves after
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.620]   spending more than two years in Ephesus, almost three years in Ephesus, Paul leaves, he goes
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:49.280]   through Macedonia at the beginning of Acts 20, he makes his way to Greece, and we know
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.320]   that he spent some time in Corinth.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.380]   In fact, while he was in Ephesus on his third missionary journey, he wrote 1 Corinthians,
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:03.660]   then he wrote 2 Corinthians, then he actually goes to Corinth, and Luke just kind of goes
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.980]   over that quickly at the beginning of Acts chapter 20, while he was in Corinth he would
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.820]   have written the book of Romans.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:16.180]   And then as he's coming back, he comes back and he makes his way to Troas, and you can
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:23.340]   see in Acts chapter 20 verse 4 that he's accompanied by a number of ministry partners, likely all
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:30.780]   men who were with him in the school of Tyrannus during that time in Ephesus.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.780]   And among those men is Timothy, and I think that's a significant point that we're going
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.580]   to come back to later.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.460]   Now if you keep reading in Acts chapter 20, you get to verses 8 to 10, which of course
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:52.540]   is the story of Eutychus, which I think is, well, it's really in the book of Acts because
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:58.860]   it's going to demonstrate for us that Paul is a genuine apostle who has the gift of an
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.940]   apostle and the ability to perform miraculous signs, including raising Eutychus from the
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.940]   dead.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.580]   I always think that perhaps Luke included it just to encourage pastors, and especially
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:17.820]   seminary professors, that even the apostle Paul went long, and as a result of going long,
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.940]   even the apostle Paul had people fall asleep on him, and of course the lesson of the story
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.180]   there is if you're going to fall asleep, don't fall asleep next to an open window.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.100]   But you know the story of Eutychus.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:38.580]   But after Eutychus, after Troas, Paul then sails to Miletus, he's on his way to Jerusalem,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:46.100]   and he calls the Ephesian elders to come and meet with him at Miletus.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.980]   And Paul tells them that he's never going to go back to Ephesus, he won't see their
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:59.460]   faces again, but he gives them a pastoral charge in Acts 20 that I would argue really
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:07.680]   is, and I realize maybe I'm making some embellished connections here, but it really is the first
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.860]   seminary graduation address ever.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:23.500]   Because you had Paul for two years in Ephesus investing in these men, and now after, again,
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.860]   more than two years, really almost three years that he was there in Ephesus, he meets with
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   them again, and he's giving them a final pastoral charge.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:48.380]   So I want to direct your attention to Acts 20, Acts 20, verse 18, and here we have, again,
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:59.620]   the Apostle Paul expressing to men whom he had invested so much, he says there in verse
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:09.940]   18, "You yourselves know from the first day that I set forth in Asia, how I was with you
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:18.580]   the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and with trials,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:27.180]   and with trials which came upon us through the plots of the Jews, how I did not shrink
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:37.580]   back from declaring to you what was profitable, and from teaching you publicly, and from house
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.800]   to house."
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:46.060]   And then if you go all the way down to verse 27, "For I did not shrink back from declaring
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.340]   to you the whole purpose of God."
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:56.380]   And then he says, "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock which the Holy Spirit
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.980]   has made you, of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.500]   of God, which he purchased with his own blood.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.940]   I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock,
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:17.860]   and from among your own selves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.420]   disciples after them.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:27.040]   Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.980]   I did not cease to admonish each of you with tears.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.700]   And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:45.580]   and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.340]   And he goes on to talk about the fact that even as he ministered among them, he did not
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.380]   covet any of their material possessions, that he worked with his own hands, that he was
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.220]   an example for them.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.820]   In everything he says there, verse 35, "I showed you that by working hard in this manner
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:10.980]   you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord, that it is better to give than
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.060]   to receive."
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:22.100]   And I love at the end of that really, again, first century graduation message that you
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:28.980]   have them responding with tears because these men are so grateful for what the Apostle Paul
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.100]   has invested in them.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.820]   And when we think about that as, again, sort of the first graduation service after the
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:44.220]   first seminary in Ephesus, Ephesus Theological Seminary we might call it, the School of Tyrannus,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:51.180]   you have these men weeping because they know that they're not going to see Paul this side
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.460]   of heaven again.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.860]   And we might ask ourselves, "What was the content of even Paul's instruction?"
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.100]   I think it's clear in this section that as Paul reflects back on what was happening in
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.620]   Acts 19, he says that, "I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole purpose of
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.620]   God."
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.620]   He taught them everything that he could about the Scriptures, about sound doctrine, about
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.420]   pastoral ministry, about all of the categories that a good seminary education should include.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.500]   And what was Paul's concern?
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:31.160]   His concern was that there would be, even among his own graduates, the men who had been
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.780]   with him for those two years in Ephesus, that there would be those who would, in their own
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:46.180]   arrogance, deviate from the truth and begin to mislead the disciples and misrepresent
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.820]   the truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.180]   And then at the end, of course, you see his pastor's heart coming out, his own example
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.860]   of integrity, and the fact that he was praying with them, weeping with them, and just signs
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:07.380]   of Christian affection, even as he gets ready to board a ship and sail for Jerusalem.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:16.740]   This all takes place, again, in Paul's third missionary journey, A.D. 55, A.D. 56, right
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:24.500]   in that time period, the middle of the sixth decade of the first century.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:33.780]   I want you then to turn to the book of 2 Timothy, the book of 2 Timothy.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:48.220]   And the reason I am rehearsing this is because roughly 10 to 12 years have passed since Paul's
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.660]   third missionary journey.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:59.140]   Paul is, when he writes 2 Timothy, under imperial arrest, likely in the Mamertine dungeon in
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.140]   Rome.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:06.780]   This is after the great fire of Rome in A.D. 64, when Nero begins to persecute Christians.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:14.740]   And sometime between A.D. 64 and Nero's death in 68, both Peter and Paul were arrested and
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.340]   executed.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:27.660]   So likely around A.D. 66 or 67, Paul finds himself in a dungeon writing a final inspired
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.100]   letter to Timothy, his son in the faith.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.140]   And where is Timothy?
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:40.300]   Timothy is pastoring, and he's pastoring the church in Ephesus.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:46.320]   And so when Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2.2, which if there was a theme verse for
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.580]   at least the Master's Seminary, and probably for many seminaries, it would be 2 Timothy
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:58.380]   2.2, when Paul says, "The things that you heard from me in the presence of many witnesses,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:06.140]   entrust these things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also," I believe that
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:12.700]   both Paul and Timothy are thinking back, not just in a general sense, to Paul's ministry
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:20.460]   over many decades, but specifically to the time in Ephesus on Paul's third missionary
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:26.860]   journey when Paul, along with Timothy, entrusted these things to the men that were gathered
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.140]   there at the school of Tyrannus.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:37.820]   And now Timothy in Ephesus is being charged by Paul to continue this same kind of training.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:43.220]   And of course, you have four generations mentioned here, you have Paul the Apostle, Timothy,
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.180]   faithful men, others also.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:52.420]   And that becomes a great paradigm for discipleship ministry, even in a pastoral training context,
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.660]   as we think about entrusting the truth to the next generation.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:03.980]   And when we look at the book of 2 Timothy as a whole, 2 Timothy highlights many of the
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.820]   very things that we seek to communicate to our students when they attend classes at the
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.820]   master's seminary.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.400]   So chapter one, you have an emphasis on not being ashamed of the gospel, on retaining
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:26.700]   the doctrine of sound words, retain the standard of sound words, and on guarding that which
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.960]   has been entrusted to you.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.700]   And then you come into chapter two, not only verse two, which we just talked about, but
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:39.580]   in the verses that follow, verses three through seven, Paul uses metaphors of an athlete,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.380]   a farmer, and a soldier.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.540]   And he says you're to be dedicated like an athlete who plays by the rules, and you're
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:55.640]   to be disciplined like a soldier, you're to be diligent like a farmer.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:02.780]   And it's that kind of dedication and discipline and diligence that even a good seminary curriculum
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:08.580]   is intended to help teach.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.860]   And seminary is hard because pastoral ministry is hard, and if you're going to be effective
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:19.180]   in pastoral ministry, you have to have that kind of dedication and discipline and diligence.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:26.220]   And then verse eight of chapter two, remember Jesus Christ, that at the heart of all of
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.460]   it is the person and work of the Lord Jesus, and then Paul goes on in the subsequent verses
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.080]   to actually articulate the gospel.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:40.180]   And then in chapter three of 2 Timothy, it's an emphasis on standing firm in the face of
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:49.020]   false doctrine, and a good seminary education teaches its students to stand firm in the
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.920]   face of error.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.140]   And how do we do that?
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:59.300]   Well, if you look in verses 14 and 15 of 2 Timothy chapter three, it's by looking to
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:05.140]   the scriptures, which as Paul reminds Timothy in those particular verses, Timothy had known
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:10.000]   the scriptures from a young age, and it was the scriptures that were able to give him
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.580]   the truth that leads to salvation through faith in Christ.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:21.460]   And then it's about the authority and the inspiration and the inerrancy and the sufficiency
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:28.900]   of scripture in verses 16 and 17, that all scripture is inspired of God, and therefore
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:35.540]   it is all that is needed so that the man of God may be complete, that he may be sufficient
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.980]   for every good work.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:45.900]   And so you go from the word of God in as the power that leads to salvation to then the
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.340]   focus on the word of God being the power through the Holy Spirit that produces sanctification,
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:57.100]   the sufficiency of scripture, and then in chapter four, the emphasis on preaching.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.940]   Preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.940]   Do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.220]   Through the preaching of the word, you're going to lead your people into sound doctrine.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.460]   And then verses six through eight, Paul kind of concludes by saying, "Look, my time has
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.460]   come to an end.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.420]   I'm like a drink offering about to be poured out.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.700]   I've run the race, I've fought the fight, I've finished the course, and I'm looking
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.820]   forward to the crown of righteousness that awaits me in heaven."
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:32.600]   And when you think about those themes, those themes really do summarize what a faithful
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:39.500]   seminary education ought to impart in its students, an understanding of the gospel,
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.540]   an understanding of sound doctrine, convictions that run deep such that students are willing
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:51.740]   to fight for, contend for, defend, and even die for those truths.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.180]   The diligence and dedication and discipline of an athlete, a farmer, and a soldier, a
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:03.220]   love for the Lord Jesus Christ, an understanding of his gospel, an understanding of false doctrine
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:09.780]   and a willingness to contend against it, and a reliance on the authority and sufficiency
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:16.580]   and the proclamation of the word of God, and even an anticipation of one day entering into
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:23.780]   the glory of heaven and receiving the reward that God graciously gives to those who love
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.420]   him and love his appearing.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.540]   All of that is in the book of 2 Timothy.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:40.300]   And again, coming back to our theme, I would argue that those represent the tangibles of
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:48.340]   what a seminary education can provide because those are things that can be emphasized in
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.060]   a curriculum.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:56.700]   They are realities and truths that can be communicated in a classroom.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.140]   Now granted, the development of convictions is something that happens in the heart, but
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.220]   informing those convictions is what a good seminary education is all about.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:12.100]   And I would argue that it was these very things that Paul was doing with his students at the
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.900]   school of Tyrannus 12 years earlier, which he's now calling Timothy to do, while Timothy
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:25.820]   is also pastoring in Ephesus, to continue that same work.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.260]   Now that was all kind of my introduction.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:37.640]   So this is not a homiletics model.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:45.620]   That raises the question, though, about the intangibles of ministry effectiveness because
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:56.220]   I think Paul identifies a number of intangible qualities that are prerequisites, meaning
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:02.780]   they're required for ministry usefulness.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.380]   And what I told our seminary students, and what I would say to anyone who is either aspiring
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:18.020]   to be a pastor or is currently serving in that role, is that these essentials are necessary
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:26.140]   for you to have a ministry that is honoring to the Lord and effective in His service.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.180]   At the Master's Seminary, we talk a lot about wanting to train up men who will be known
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.740]   as master's men.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.620]   And there's a sense in which when we say that, master's men, we are specifically referring
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.380]   to the fact that they are graduates of the Master's Seminary.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.900]   I get that.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:52.840]   But I want to use that idea and that concept not to talk about alumni of TMS.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.940]   This is not that.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:03.780]   What this is, is I want us to think about being those who are fit for the master's service.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.580]   And in that sense, I want to call all of you, no matter where you went to seminary, or even
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.580]   if you haven't gone to seminary, to be a master's man.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:20.340]   I think we find these intangible qualities at the end of 2 Timothy 2, in verses 14, all
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.840]   the way to the end of the chapter.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:29.180]   And what's interesting is what you'll notice in verse 19, is Paul says, "The Lord knows
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.420]   those who are His."
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:37.540]   And then in verse 21, he emphasizes the fact that Timothy is to be one who is fit for the
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.880]   master's service.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:46.740]   And then in verse 24, he says, "The Lord's bond servant is not quarrelsome."
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:54.160]   So there is an emphasis in this section on being one who is a servant or a slave of the
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:02.060]   master, the Lord Jesus Christ, and what it looks like to be faithful in service to Him.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:09.240]   And what's interesting about the qualities that Paul emphasizes in this section is that
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:15.540]   they're not tangible things, they're intangible things.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:21.160]   In other words, they're not the kinds of things that we can just put in a curriculum and download
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.760]   in a lecture.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.600]   They are instead the work of the Spirit in a heart that's been regenerated as that heart
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:35.060]   and that life is conformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:40.700]   When I was growing up, I played some sports.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.820]   I realized that I'm definitely in the nerd category of life, and that's okay, I embrace
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   that.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.420]   But I did actually play some sports growing up.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.200]   I played 10 years of baseball.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.700]   And then when I got into high school, I actually switched over and played four years of tennis
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.740]   at my local high school.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.100]   And even in junior high, I played a little bit of flag football, I was even a center
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.980]   at one point, if you can believe that.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.800]   And I played a little bit of basketball.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:17.060]   And I had very good coaches who taught us the tangibles of each of those games, right?
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.180]   Because there are things that you can learn, there are skills, knowing how to hold the
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:27.580]   ball if you're gonna shoot a free throw correctly, understanding how to swing the bat, learning
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:34.060]   how to keep your eye on the ball for, that was a problem that I had sometimes, it just
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.280]   kept taking my eye off the ball.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.340]   And those are the tangible things, they're the things, even the rules of the game, they're
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.660]   all things that can be taught and that can be practiced.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.180]   But the thing that separates the mediocre athletes, and I was definitely in that category,
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:57.780]   in case there was any confusion, the thing that distinguishes the mediocre athletes from
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:04.540]   the elite athletes is that elite athletes not only understand the tangibles and they
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:11.680]   work hard at getting better at those things, they also understand the intangibles.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.740]   There's like an X factor, they understand the game in a way that's different than the
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.220]   way that most people understand the game.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.600]   They have qualities that if you were to ask their coach, their coach would say, "Those
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.380]   are things you can't teach."
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:35.300]   And here in 2 Timothy 2 at the end of the chapter, I think Paul identifies three of
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:44.380]   these intangible qualities that mark a master's man, or better said, they mark a man who is
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:49.960]   fit for the master's service.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:58.260]   And these are the qualities that, quite honestly, we are looking for in our students, not because
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.860]   we think we can teach them these things in the classroom, but because we understand that
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:08.620]   these are essential to their future ministry success.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.580]   And I mean success not in terms of numbers, I mean success in terms of faithfulness.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:19.900]   And I would even be so bold as to suggest that if you do not cultivate these three intangible
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.220]   qualities in your own heart and life through the grace of God and through the work of His
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.460]   Spirit as He sanctifies you and conforms you into the image of the Master, that your ministry
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:39.500]   will end in failure if these things are not true about your life.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:46.140]   So what are these intangibles?
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:54.820]   Maybe even before I start talking about these three intangibles, just one more comment as
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.300]   I'm thinking about 2 Timothy.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.440]   And I think this really brings this whole thing home, at least it does for me, is you
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:11.780]   have back in Acts 20, Paul expressing to the Ephesian elders a warning, "Be on your guard.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:18.180]   Be on your guard for yourself and for your flock because what's going to happen is there
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:25.980]   are going to be people, even from among you, who are going to rise up, they're going to
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:32.640]   speak perverse things, and they're going to seek to lead astray the disciples."
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.020]   That was the warning.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.100]   If that was 10 to 12 years before Paul wrote this, then I don't think it's too much of
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:48.940]   a stretch to think that the five men that Paul names in 2 Timothy, those who had defected
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:56.460]   from the faith, could quite possibly have been among his students in Ephesus at the
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:03.260]   school of Tyrannus, the very ones that he was warning the Ephesian elders about.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:08.240]   So you have phagellus and homogenies at the end of chapter 1.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.600]   In this section in chapter 2, you have hymenaeus and phyletus.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:18.900]   And then most infamous of all in chapter 4, you have demas.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:25.000]   And here against the backdrop of that kind of defection, you have Paul urging Timothy
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.520]   to continue the very work that Paul started in Ephesus of training men and sending them
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.960]   out, training men and sending them out.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.560]   But he reminds Timothy, both for Timothy and for those who would train under him, that
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:47.300]   there are these intangible requirements if you're going to be found faithful and be useful
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.900]   to the Master.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:55.920]   The first one is in verses 14 to 19, and I would say it this way, it's a posture of humility
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.200]   that reveres the Word of God.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:07.060]   A posture of humility that reveres the Word of God.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:16.280]   So verse 14, Paul says, "Remind them of these things and solemnly charge them in the presence
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:23.400]   of God, not to wrangle about words which is useful and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:29.920]   But verse 15, be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.120]   need to be ashamed, accurately handling the Word of truth, but avoid worldly and empty
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.440]   chatter for it will lead to further ungodliness.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.680]   And their talk will spread like gangrene among whom are hymenaeus and phyletus, men who have
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:51.240]   gone astray from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place and they
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.080]   upset the faith of many.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.320]   Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands having this seal, the Lord knows who
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:09.720]   are his and everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness."
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:19.480]   Well here Paul is charging Timothy to pursue a posture of humility, especially in relationship
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.100]   to the Word of God.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.320]   And so he begins by charging him to charge others in the presence of God himself.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:34.440]   He invokes the very presence of God to humble Timothy and his hearers.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.560]   And what does that humility look like?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:44.000]   It looks like a submission to and a careful study of the scriptures.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.440]   In fact, I'm reminded of one of my favorite verses in terms of defining true humility,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:57.100]   Isaiah 66 verse 2, where God himself says, "To this one I will look, to the one who is
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:05.500]   humble, contrite of spirit, and who trembles at my word."
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.920]   What is humility?
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.760]   Well we could define humility in a number of different ways and there would be many
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.900]   passages that would come to mind.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:20.000]   But I would argue that one of the primary expressions of humility is that humility trembles
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.320]   before and submits itself to the Word of God, such that those who raise themselves up against
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:36.280]   the Word of God demonstrate themselves to be and to possess the height of arrogance.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.040]   And that certainly was true here with Hymenaeus and Philetus.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.400]   And even if you were to go back and look at Acts chapter 20 and what Paul said in that
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:50.800]   first graduation message, he said to them, "I have conducted myself, I have served the
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.100]   Lord with all humility."
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:05.520]   And here he is warning Timothy to avoid the kind of arrogance that is sloppy or discards
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:13.760]   its treatment of scripture and instead loves to hear itself talk.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.040]   And honestly when I read these verses, I know this isn't in the original context, but it's
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.760]   hard not to think of social media when you read all of this about the arrogance of wrangling
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:34.840]   about words and saying all sorts of nonsense, when we as those who are spokesmen for God
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:43.520]   are called and commissioned to be diligent and precise in our handling of the text.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.760]   I don't know if you men have thought of it this way, but when you study hard for your
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:55.920]   next sermon, that is an expression of true humility.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:03.400]   And when you phone it in, well, I don't know your heart.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.160]   But isn't it interesting that in this context against the arrogance of the false teachers,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:15.560]   what Paul urges Timothy to do is to be diligent, to be found as an approved workman who rightly
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.400]   handles the word of truth so that when he stands before his congregation and one day
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:29.780]   when he stands before his master, he need not be ashamed.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:35.320]   This is a different topic for a different day, but I do think sometimes we've turned
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.240]   the pursuit of humility and even the idea of humility into something that is almost
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.640]   undefinable and equally unattainable.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:49.320]   Sort of the idea that if I think I'm humble, then I'm not the moment I think I am.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:54.480]   But when we look biblically at how Scripture defines humility, Scripture defines humility
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.720]   in very objective ways.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:03.640]   Put on the mind of Christ, prefer one another above yourselves, seek the good of others,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:10.880]   love your neighbor, and here in this passage in Isaiah 66 to be diligent to submit your
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.680]   life and your doctrine to the word of God.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.340]   It's an expression of humility.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:26.000]   And if you want to be useful in the master service, you must put on that kind of humble
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   posture.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   And verse 19 really accentuates that point.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.320]   It reminds us that everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:50.560]   and even the statement before that, the Lord knows who are his.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.440]   So in the presence of God himself, it's interesting to me that looking at verse 15, it's interesting
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:04.360]   to me, or 14 and 15, it's interesting to me that Paul will again invoke the very presence
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:11.560]   of God in this very letter, 2 Timothy chapter 4, and he'll invoke the presence of God before
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.900]   charging Timothy to preach.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:20.940]   So the invoking of the presence of God ought to result in an utter awareness of our own
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:27.860]   unworthiness and a complete sense of humble desperation.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:37.900]   And in light of and in view of the very presence of our sovereign God, Paul uses that picture
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.360]   to charge Timothy to do two things.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:47.820]   One is to study well, and the other is to preach courageously.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.380]   Both are expressions of humility.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:47:04.940]   Well, there's a second intangible, it's in verses 20 to 23, and it is what I would call
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.340]   a pattern of holiness that reflects the character of God.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.780]   So we have a posture of humility that reveres the word of God, and then secondly, a pattern
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   of holiness that reflects the character of God.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:25.180]   And so verse 20, "Now in a large house, there are not only gold and silver vessels, but
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:31.940]   also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:37.900]   Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor,
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:44.140]   sanctified," and here it is, "useful to the master, prepared for every good work," verse
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   22.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:52.700]   "Now flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:58.340]   on the Lord from a pure heart, but refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:07.020]   that they produce quarrels."
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:12.240]   For our seminary students as men preparing for pastoral ministry, for you men as men
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.580]   who are already out in the trenches on the front lines, this is a sobering but helpful
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:26.620]   reminder that if you are going to be useful in the master's service, your life must be
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.380]   characterized by a pattern of personal holiness.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:41.900]   And obviously it doesn't take much in our day and age to think of illustrations of those
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:50.100]   who have failed in this area and as a result lost their ministry influence.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:55.300]   That's what Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 9, "I buffet my body, I run in such a way
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:04.020]   so that having preached to others, I will not myself be disqualified."
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:14.100]   And in the same way that I can think of examples of men who through a lack of humility have
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:20.220]   lost ministry influence, certainly I can think of examples of men who through a lack of personal
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.740]   purity have lost ministry influence.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:33.700]   And the reality is that you cannot live in the pursuit of your own lusts and at the same
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:41.660]   time be useful in ministry for the Lord.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:51.380]   I think of Robert Murray McShane who famously said that, "My people's greatest need is my
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:58.220]   own personal holiness."
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:09.780]   When I was growing up, had an extended family member who was in ministry and had an extramarital
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.760]   affair and was disqualified.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:20.820]   When I was in my high school youth group, my high school pastor had to resign because
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:27.620]   he had done some things he wasn't supposed to do and he was disqualified.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:36.260]   I remember coming to seminary and serving with men, studying with men, and then graduating
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.300]   with them and seeing them go off, and then you hear every once in a while the report
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:49.460]   of a guy who lost his ministry because he couldn't control his lust.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:56.240]   And as someone who's training the next generation of men to go out, my plea to them and my plea
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:03.620]   to you men is if you are going to be fit for the Master's use, you must put to death the
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:10.380]   lust of the flesh, because one who is a Master's man cannot pursue his own lust and at the
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:14.900]   same time pursue the Lord.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:21.060]   And I know you men know this, but it is one of the intangible essentials for ministry
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:26.740]   effectiveness and that is your own personal purity.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:35.740]   Because if you are not a holy instrument, then you are not useful in the Master's service.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:44.140]   And Paul's urging to Timothy is, "Timothy, keep yourself pure for the sake of ministry
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:54.140]   influence so that you might be one who is useful to the Lord."
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:52:01.880]   So a posture of humility that reveres the Word of God, a pattern of holiness that reflects
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:09.540]   the character of God, and the third thing would be what I call a pastor's heart, a pastor's
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:16.300]   heart that resembles the loving kindness of the Lord.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:23.020]   A pastor's heart that resembles the loving kindness of the Lord.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.940]   Verse 24 to the end of the chapter, "The Lord's bondservant must not be quarrelsome, but he
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:36.660]   must be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:42.060]   who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.820]   of the truth.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:49.100]   And they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:55.660]   captive by him to do his will."
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.740]   Verse 24 is such a great reminder, isn't it, that the Lord's bondservant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:11.180]   but be kind to all, and patient when wronged, and engage even in disagreement with gentleness.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:18.900]   Verse 25, I know I mentioned social media already in my first point, but I feel like
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:27.780]   it's hard to escape the implications of this verse for the way that even professing Christians
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.500]   engage with one another on social media.
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:38.820]   Imagine if we actually applied this verse to our ex-accounts, formerly known as Twitter.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:43.100]   I feel like you always have to say that.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:49.700]   How that would change our online interactions if we, as those who are the Lord's bondservants,
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:55.860]   were characterized not by being harsh, or by having zingers, or by embarrassing the
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:02.420]   opposition, but instead we're characterized by kindness, and patience, and gentleness,
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:08.660]   and trust in the Lord that if they are going to have a change of mind, it must be God who
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.260]   grants repentance.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:17.020]   And I realize I'm preaching to the choir here, but I think it's a good reminder for all of
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:29.380]   us when we feel that inner indignation that someone on the internet is wrong that we remember
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:39.940]   that we are to be the Lord's bondservant, and this is how the Lord's bondservants respond.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:47.340]   So these were the things that Paul instructs to Timothy with regard to how to be useful
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:52.700]   in ministry, both for Timothy and for the men who Timothy was to train, going back up
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:56.060]   to verse 2 of chapter 2.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:02.520]   And I call them the intangibles, again, because these are character-related issues that get
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:07.940]   to the heart of a person's walk with the Lord.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:12.220]   They're not things that can be learned in a classroom.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:17.780]   Yes, in our classes we talk about humility, and we talk about holiness, and we talk about
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:23.980]   the kind of care and compassion that ought to characterize a pastor's heart, but the
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:31.260]   reality is these are things that can't just be learned in a book.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:38.700]   They have to be cultivated through the power of the Holy Spirit and the truth of Scripture
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:49.780]   as the Spirit takes His Word and uses it to grow us in grace and appoint us to Christ.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   But I have known many graduates, not only of the Master's Seminary, but of other seminaries.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:06.940]   I've known men who have excelled in all of the tangibles.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.600]   They get great grades.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.500]   They know all the answers.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.260]   They have their systematic theology down.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:19.580]   They can argue like no one else when it comes to apologetics.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:29.260]   They could have a YouTube ministry or a Twitter ministry, and they could blow away the opponents.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:36.820]   But men, if they're lacking a humble posture before the Word of God, if they're lacking
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:43.740]   a pattern of holiness that reflects the character of God, if they're lacking a pastor's heart
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:52.340]   that resembles the compassion of our Savior, they will not be successful in ministry, not
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:56.220]   in the way that actually matters.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:05.580]   They will instead be like Hermogenes and Phagellus, Hymenaeus and Philetus and Demas, men who
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:11.500]   were arrogant, who were slaves to their own lusts, and who didn't care about the sheep
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.060]   at all.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:21.980]   Well, I mentioned that Acts chapter 20 is, from my view, the first graduation service,
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:27.340]   but the reality is Timothy's graduation service didn't really happen until the end of his
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   life.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:36.140]   According to church tradition, Timothy pastored the church in Ephesus for roughly three decades,
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:41.740]   all the way into probably the late '80s, maybe even the early '90s.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:48.680]   He was eventually killed when there was a Roman pagan festival taking place in Ephesus,
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:54.300]   and he went out to urge the people to stop worshiping idols, and he was mobbed and beaten
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:59.500]   so badly that he died several days later from his wounds.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.940]   Timothy died as a martyr to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.220]   Martyr is from a Greek word martus, which means witness.
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.860]   He was a witness to Christ even to the end.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:13.340]   And Timothy's graduation service, just like the graduation service for any and all of
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:22.860]   us, the real graduation service took place when he left this life and entered into the
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.540]   presence of his Savior.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:34.700]   And what is it that all of us long to hear our Savior and our Master say to us when we
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:41.540]   stand before Him on that day?
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:45.140]   "Amen."
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:52.840]   You cannot succeed in ministry in the way that really matters.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.980]   In other words, in the way that meets with His approval so that He would say to us, "Well
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.340]   done, my good and faithful servant."
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:07.400]   You cannot minister in the way that is truly successful unless you cultivate these kinds
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:16.340]   of attitudes so that they are the character qualities that characterize your ministry,
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:23.100]   so that your people see you as a model of humble submission to the Word of God.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:28.220]   And they know that that's true because every week you are preaching to them with precision
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.940]   and accuracy and faithfulness to the text.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.580]   And they see you as a model of personal holiness.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.260]   And they know that that's true because your life is above reproach and the things that
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:49.680]   you pursue are the opposite of those things that characterize worldliness.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:57.620]   And they see in you a pattern of pastoral care, a heart of compassion and kindness that
[00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:02.660]   reflects the gentleness of the Savior Himself.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:09.620]   Those are the ingredients that ensure His favor.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:15.500]   And without them, you cannot succeed.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.420]   So seminary can teach you a lot.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:25.060]   And if you've never been to seminary, I'd love to talk to you about coming to TMS.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.020]   But that's not really the point of this message.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:33.340]   There are things that you cannot learn in a classroom, but they are essential to ministry,
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.100]   faithfulness, and effectiveness.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:40.900]   If you are going to be useful to the Master, pursue humility, pursue holiness, and pursue
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.820]   a heart that reflects His kindness.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.860]   Let's pray.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:53.140]   Father, thank you for the opportunity to work through this text.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:01:04.220]   So grateful for the truth of your Word and for your Holy Spirit who imparts that truth
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:10.820]   to our hearts and strengthens us where we are weak and uses us in spite of our failings.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.860]   We know that if we are to be faithful, it is only by your grace.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:20.780]   And so we ask that by your grace and for your glory, we might be found faithful, not for
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:28.860]   our sake, but for yours, and for the sake of our people, so that they might be built
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:36.300]   up as the body of Christ and that one day we might all appear before our Savior and
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:43.340]   join that great assembly that will sing His praise for all of eternity.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.740]   It is for His glory that we pray these things.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.220]   Thank you for these men, but we pray these things in the name of Christ, amen.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:02:00.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
