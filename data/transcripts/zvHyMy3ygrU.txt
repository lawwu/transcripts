[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Are the pressures in my life making me more holy, or are they making me more unholy?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And how would I know the difference? This is such a great question.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   A lot of our emails come in from Christians who are feeling extra pressure in life,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and that is certainly true in an email from a young mom named Victoria,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   who is facing the challenges of raising little ones.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "Hello Pastor John," she writes, "since becoming a mom, I've found myself battling sin like never before.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   New sins that I never recall struggling with are popping up, seemingly out of nowhere,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   especially in this season with a two-year-old and a newborn.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My desire is to be a wife and mother to the glory of God,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but I feel I have never been further away from this goal.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Are these new pressures of motherhood sanctifying me or making me more unholy?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And how can I tell the difference, because I often feel as though I am becoming more unholy by them?"
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   This is a tremendously important question, because it gets at a reality of sanctification
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   that is often overlooked—namely, that pride and various forms of that sin can lie latent,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   unseen, in the forgiven, spirit-indwelt Christian,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   often giving the impression to the Christian himself and to others that we are more holy than we are.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I picture Christians in this condition like a glass of water.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   While the glass of water is very still, sitting on the counter,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   the sediment of pride and other sins can lie unnoticed at the bottom of the glass.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So the water is clear and seems cleaner than it really is.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But if you bump the glass—and that bumping corresponds to the pressures of motherhood, for example—
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   then the sediment of pride and sin is stirred up and shows itself in attitudes and words and actions
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   which show that the glass of water isn't as clean as we thought it was.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's more sinful than we thought.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Now, that is a very important reality to come to terms with as a Christian.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And this question forces us to come to terms with it—all of us, not just moms.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So I'm very glad for the question, even though it's painful for us to talk about this,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   because, at least for me it is, I don't like it when circumstances bump my glass and bring out the worst in me.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So let me just state briefly seven biblical observations
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   that give the foundation for this understanding of sanctification and how we should respond to it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   First, God teaches us in his Word that the pressures of motherhood or pastoring
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   or any other kind of trouble or pressure, small or great, are designed by God for the purifying of his people.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   1 Peter 1.6, "For a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   so that the tested genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   The pressures of motherhood are like a fire designed not to consume but to refine the gold of the mother's faith.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Hebrews 12.10, "God disciplines us for our good that we may share his holiness."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's the goal of all painful or pressured circumstances in the Christian life,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   the peaceful fruit of righteousness, the gold of godliness refined.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   2. Second Observation, Tribulations and pressures drive some Christians away from the faith forever.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Jesus said in the parable of the soils, "As for what was sown on the rocky ground,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yet he has no root in himself, but he endures for a little while,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and when tribulations or persecutions arise, so the glass gets bumped,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   on account of the word, immediately he falls away." Matthew 13.20.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   3. Third Observation, God will not let that happen to his children, his elect.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   He will not let us be tested beyond the grace he gives us to stand. 1 Corinthians 10.13.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Or, as it says in 1 Corinthians 1.8, "He will sustain you to the end, guiltless,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Or Romans 8.30, "Those whom he called, he justified; those whom he justified, he glorified."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   If he called you, he will keep you. 4. Fourth Observation, the story of Job shows
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   that some of the most godly people have latent pride in their heart
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   that certain pressures and troubles will reveal. The book of Job starts like this.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   one who feared God and turned away from evil. So Job really was a good, godly, faithful man.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He did not live in a way that brought down any blame on his actions.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   But then came the trials. At first, Job's response was, "As good as it gets."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   In submission, in humility, in trust, he said, "The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord." But later, it was more than he could bear,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and he got angry at God. He said things like, "Why do you count me as your enemy?"
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's Job 13.24. God wasn't Job's enemy. He wasn't.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   This beautiful glass of water had now become cloudy. Job was not perfect.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And the result of Job's glass of water becoming cloudy with pride and anger at God was this, Job 42.5.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Repentance, when the glass is bumped and the sediment is stirred up that nobody knew was there.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   This leads to the fifth observation. God exposes the remnants of pride and sin in our lives
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   so that we will do what Job did. See ourselves more clearly and repent more deeply.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Sixth, this means that in the process of sanctification, it often feels like we are going backward.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   This is what she asks about. Job began so well in chapters 1 and 2, and later, not so well.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   He did go backwards, at least temporarily it looked like Job's getting more unholy.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So what is the answer to Victoria's question?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   She says that the pressures of motherhood are drawing out of her more sin, as far as she can see.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So is she becoming more holy by these pressures or more unholy?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And what we've seen is that she's standing at a fork in the road.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Will the pressures and troubles turn her into a third soil that falls away from Christ
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and proves she was never a Christian in the first place?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Or will she be like Job in the end, which leads to repentance?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And so my final point, my seventh observation is an exhortation.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Let your pressures and troubles and the apparent increase of sin, which really was there all along,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   let it all make God's grace sweeter and let it make your heart humbler
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and let it make your repentance deeper and your warfare against sin more earnest
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   as you fight like a forgiven child of God.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for bringing up the observations from the life of Job.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   That's quite insightful.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And Victoria, thank you for such an outstanding question.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I pray that this episode will encourage you in the long fight for personal holiness.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Well, thank you for joining us today.

[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Well, how do we best study the narratives in Scripture?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And how does John Piper outline historical books?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   What's he looking for in narratives, keywords, transitions,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   things different from maybe how he outlines epistles, for example?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I will ask him this very question on Monday.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   [END]
