[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The following is a conversation with Brian Murevescu, author of The Immortality Key,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.400]   The Secret History of the Religion with No Name, a book that reconstructs the forgotten
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.400]   history of psychedelics in the development of Western civilization. To support this podcast,

[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.480]   links are in the description. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.440]   with Brian Murevescu. Who or what do you think God is? How has our conception maybe put another
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.920]   way of God changed throughout history? We're starting with an easy one, Lex. Yep.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.120]   So what is God? Well, God is a thought. God is an idea, but its reference is to that which is
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   beyond thinking, beyond our ability to even conceive, beyond the categories of being and
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   non-being. So how do we talk about that? To talk about it is almost to get it wrong, right? So
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.160]   Joe Campbell famously said that any God that is not transparent to transcendence is like an
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.320]   idolatry because it's just a mental construct, and it can't possibly speak to the incomprehensible.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.240]   So we use poetic language. We say the being of beings, the infinite life energy of the universe,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.960]   the mystery of transcendence, boundless life, unqualified isness. But it doesn't quite get
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   to the point. I think that if there's any great insight from mysticism, it's that you and I
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.240]   participate with God in a very real way, Lex Friedman, here in Austin, Texas. That in the here
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.160]   and now, to touch that eternal principle, another way to refer to God, to touch that eternal principle
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.400]   within ourselves is to participate with divinity in some way. So not an external force, but that
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.600]   divine sense within. So there's some aspect in which God is a part of us. So one, it's a thing
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.440]   we can't describe. It represents all of the mystery around us. It's outside our ability
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.640]   to comprehend. And at the same time, it's somehow the thing that's inside of us also.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.000]   The ultimate paradox. MacThiel of Magdeburg, 13th century German mystic, maybe the first German
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.960]   mystic, says that the day of her spiritual awakening was the day that she saw and knew
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.160]   that she saw God in all things, and all things in God. And so we can say this, by the way,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.040]   without apology or lightweight theology or vapid speculation or even heresy, we can talk about this,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   including within the Abrahamic faiths. The mystical core of these faiths all talk about
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   the encounter of divinity within. That's what I explore in the immortality key, this notion
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.200]   of techniques, archaic techniques in some cases, of ecstasy that allow that experience of the
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   eternal principle to actually rise up in our consciousness when we're still here as flesh
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.640]   and blood beings. There's some sense in which our conception of God, though, is conjured up by
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.880]   our own mind. And so aren't we creating God? Like, aren't we the gods that are creating the idea of
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   God? Like, if we are, like when we talk about God, aren't we playing with ideas that are created by
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   our mind, and thereby we are the creator, not God? This is a very kind of cyclical question, but
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:53.680]   in some sense I mean that if God is the thing that represents the mystery all around us,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.960]   contrast that with our conception of God, the way we talk about him, is more a creation of our
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.800]   minds. It's not the mystery, it's our struggle to comprehend the mystery. And therefore we're
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.600]   creating the God in terms of the God that we're talking about in this conversation or in general,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.880]   if that makes any sense. - It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.800]   - Great, this is wonderful. - But this is the eternal mystery.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.600]   This is why it's so difficult to talk about, and yet it could be the very center of our beings.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.960]   You know, the Upanishads speak about us as the creators, about us as gods. It's a very
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.160]   different creation myth, but the god of the Upanishads in this great verse talks about
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.400]   pouring themselves into creation. "Indeed, I have become this creation," says God. And there's a
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:57.040]   great line, "Verily, he or she who knows this becomes in this creation a creator." So yeah,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.760]   I mean just our ability to engage in mentation, our ability to think about this stuff is partly
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   our divine nature. This is what the humanists were talking about in the Renaissance, by the way.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.320]   And that it's not so much learning, putting dots together, having arguments with each other over
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.680]   learned books. It's a process of unlearning, is what some of the mystical traditions talk about.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.000]   Unlearning all these thoughts, emotions, traumas, and experiences that have gone into the false
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.800]   construction of our false self, that behind all these layers, like peeling back the onion,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   is a part of us that once you can identify that, begins to look a little bit different.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.880]   In other words, it's one thing to foster a relationship with God. It's a very different
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.920]   thing to identify as God. And I mean that quite literally, without being heretical. You can find
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:01.760]   this in the mystery traditions. - Can you expand on this? You mean a human being can embody God?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.320]   - That is textbook incarnational theology that you can find in any Christian mystic.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.000]   But you can find it in the mystical tradition of Islam and Judaism as well. So Rumi, for example,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   the great Sufi mystic, talks about if you could get rid of yourself, just get rid of yourself just
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.480]   once, the secret of secrets would open to you. That the face of the unknown would appear on the
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   perception of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern-day contemporary mystic,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   talks about, because this stuff does continue, there's a continuity to it. - The poetry here
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   is incredible. - So well, listen to Rabbi Kushner. He says that the emptying of selfhood
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.400]   allows the soul to attach to true reality. And in Kabbalism, the true reality is what's called
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.680]   the divine nothingness, ayin. And so I like the adage that atheists and mystics both essentially
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.240]   believe in nothing, except that the mystics spell it with a capital N, the divine nothing.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.760]   And then I'll give you Meister Eckhart, another medieval Christian mystic. He says that
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.400]   if you could not yourself, right? The same concept, if you could not yourself for just an instant,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   indeed, I say less than an instant, you would possess all. So again, you're seeing the same
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.600]   thing in Sufism, Kabbalism, Christian mysticism. The way to identify with the divine is to peel
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   back these layers and attempt to discover pure awareness. - If we look at the universe from a
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.800]   physics perspective, or, you know, I'm a computer science person, so if the universe is a computer,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:55.600]   there's some sense that God, the creator of the universe, or just the computer itself,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.120]   doesn't know what the heck is gonna happen. He just kind of creates some basic rules and runs
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:08.400]   the thing. So there is some element in which you can conceive of humans or conscious beings or
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:19.360]   intelligent beings as a tool that the creator uses to understand itself, himself. Do you think that's
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   a perspective that we could, or is useful to take on God, that is basically the universe created
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:36.160]   humans to understand itself? He doesn't actually know the full thing. He needs the human brains
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.360]   to figure out the puzzle. So that's in contrasting to the unlearning, to the getting out of the way
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.760]   that we've talked about. It's more like, no, we need the humans to figure out this puzzle.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.560]   - Well, we have no answers to this, which is why philosophers still have jobs,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.160]   if they have jobs at all. But I mean, so the physicists take a look at this.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.280]   Have you seen the article that came out, I think it was this month, in the Journal of Cosmology and
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.440]   Astroparticle Physics, Robert Lanza, the biocentrism theory, the idea that the universe comes
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.480]   into being through our observation, right? The whole, the God equation. So not just in quantum
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.920]   mechanics, but in general relativity, the idea that we make the universe moment by moment, which
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.600]   is kind of mind-blowing, gets into ideas of simulation. Okay, so that's how the physicists,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.080]   at least some of them, might look at it. You could also look back to the medieval Christian mystics.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   Meister Eckhart, once again, says that the eye with which I see God is the same eye that sees me,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:42.320]   right? So one sight, one knowledge, one love. Another mind-blowing concept. But this is why
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.640]   the arts and poetry and music are so important, because although I love astroparticle physics,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.840]   it's another to kind of hear this, the same message across time.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   Yeah, the simulation thing. I was actually looking this morning at video games, just the statistics
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.920]   on video games, and I saw that the two top video games in terms of hours played is Fortnite and
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:13.600]   World of Warcraft. And I saw that it's 140 billion hours, billion hours have been played at those
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.760]   games. - That's a lot of video games.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:24.080]   - Yeah, but that's very sophisticated worlds being created, especially in the World of Warcraft.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.600]   It's a massive online role-playing game. So you have these characters that are together,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.640]   sort of creating a world, but they in themselves are also developing. They have all these items
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.560]   and they're growing, like they're little humans. Like there's complicated societies that are
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.520]   formed, they have goals, they're striving and so on. And we're creating a universe within our
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:52.320]   universe. And for now, it's a basic sort of constraint version of our more richer earth-like
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:00.880]   civilization. But it's conceivable that we are this thing on earth is a kind of video game that
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.600]   somebody else is playing. You can see sort of video games upon video games being created.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.040]   And this is something I think a lot about, not from a philosophical perspective, but practically
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.080]   how fun does this video game have to be for us to let go of the silly pursuits in this
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   meat space that we live in and fully just stay in WoW, stay in World of Warcraft,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.440]   stay in the video game for full time. So I think about that from an engineering perspective,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.800]   like is there going to be a time when this video game is actual real life for us? And then the
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.440]   creatures inside the video game, they'll be just borrowing our consciousness sort of to ground
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:54.880]   themselves, will refer to us as the gods, right? Like, won't we become the gods? This conversation
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.400]   is not going how I expected, but I think about this a lot from, you know, cause I love video games
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.280]   and I wonder more and more of us, especially in COVID times are living in the digital world.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.520]   You could think about Twitter and all those kinds of things. You could think about clubhouse people
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.040]   using just voices to communicate little icons sort of in a digital space. You could see more and more
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   will be moving in the digital space and let go of this physical space. And then the remnants
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:29.200]   of the ancients that created the video games that nobody centuries from now will even remember,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.560]   those will be the gods and then there'll be gods upon gods being created. This is the kind of stuff
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.880]   I think about, but is that any at all useful to you to this thought experiment of a simulation,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   basically the fabric of our reality, how did it come to be, what is running this thing? Is that
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.760]   useful or is it ultimately the project of understanding God of understanding myth is
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:01.520]   the project that centers on the human, on the human mind for you? We seem to be at the center
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.200]   of this divine dance, which sounds awfully anthropocentric, but the ancients thought
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   about this too. I mean, the concept in Sanskrit of Leela, that the point behind existence is this
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.920]   play, right? It's ultimately playful, this divine dance. It gets awfully complicated in the Gnostic
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:28.320]   and Neoplatonic schools, these chains of being from Godhead down to us, right? Some invisible,
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.440]   right? And we're going to get into Terence McKenna territory later on, but we can start now
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.560]   by talking about discarded entities and archons and aliens and archetypes. I mean,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:45.520]   there is a world where Terence McKenna does meet Plato and Gnosticism quite kindly, and that's in
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.360]   this invisible college, right? The invisible world with which we seem to have some kind of symbiosis
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.640]   that has a higher intent, maybe even a purpose or a plan in mind for us. So, I mean, these ideas
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.120]   come across when you've had a heroic dose of mushrooms. They also pop up in the ancient
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.880]   philosophical literature, this idea of archons who, you know, the puppet masters controlling
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.200]   us flesh and blood beings. It's all a cosmic dance, and there are no answers to this.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.440]   - First, who are the archons? And second, what is this world where Terence McKenna meets Plato?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.400]   Do you mean in the space of ideas, or are we talking about some kind of world that connects
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.560]   all of consciousness to all of human history? - I think through different techniques, it is,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.400]   you know, I think a lot about, I think Gordon Wasson is the meeting point of the two. So,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   Gordon Wasson, who I do talk about in the book, was this JP Morgan banker turned ethnomycologist,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   and he's largely credited with the rediscovery of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, which kind
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:53.920]   of gave rise to the pop psychedelic revolution of the 1960s. He visited Maria Sabina down in Mexico.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.440]   In his wake went Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, The Stones, and everybody else.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.920]   And the way he describes his psilocybin experience is a bit strange because he thinks of Plato,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.840]   right? And he says that, you know, whereas our ordinary reality is kind of this imperfect
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.440]   view of things, Gordon Wasson felt that on mushrooms, he was spying the archetypes.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.680]   And he talks about Plato, and he writes about the archetypes in this famous article that's
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.400]   released in 1957 in Life magazine. And so, a well-read individual from the mid-20th century
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.640]   has his premier psychedelic experience, and out comes Plato because what he was witnessing was
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.440]   so sharp, so brilliant, so detailed, in some sense more real than real, this noetic sense
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.400]   that William James talks about. That when you confront something more real than real,
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.520]   these discarnate entities, these images, these visionary motifs, you're tempted to believe that
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.720]   you've tapped into the truest nature and the underlying structure of the cosmos. And that's
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.440]   difficult to escape from, whether you're Plato or Terence McKenna or Gordon Wasson caught in between.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.720]   Can we talk about this, being in touch with something that is more real than real?
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.520]   And let's just go straight there to McKenna before we return to the bigger picture.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   So, he's talked about the, what is it, self-healing machine elves?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.120]   Self-transforming.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   Self-transforming machine elves during his DMT travels. And I just talked to Rick Doblin,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.480]   who also had different travels through this hyperspace.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.880]   But they all seem to be traveling on the same spaceship, just to different locations.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.720]   And there is a sense in which they seem to be traveling through whatever, I don't know if it's
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.600]   through space-time or something else, to meet something that is more real than real.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.680]   What can you say about this DMT experience, about Terence McKenna, about the poetry he used,
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.320]   but maybe more specifically about this place that they seem to all travel to?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.760]   So, the big question is, is it real? Is it really more real than real? The ancient philosophers
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.960]   were asking the same question, and their means of attempting to answer that was by dying.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   So, if you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:18.720]   to practice it in the right way is to practice dying and being dead. And many people describe
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.240]   the psychedelic experience in sort of near-death experience terms. And the encountering of all
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.920]   this visual imagery tends to be something that is often described as more real than real.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.640]   So, how does Terence talk about this? So, I was just listening to the trilogues, which folks
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.440]   should look up. Somewhere between 1989 and 1990, Terence sits down with his friends,
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.080]   Ralph Abraham and Rupert Sheldrake at Esalen, and they're trying to figure out the meaning of these
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.920]   discarnate entities and these non-human intelligences. And Terence develops a taxonomy
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.240]   for how to analyze this. And he says that number one, they're either
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:05.760]   semi-physical but kind of elusive. So, think of the Bigfoot or the Yeti or things like this,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:13.120]   beings that exist somewhere between mythology and zoology, which isn't really appropriate here.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:21.040]   So, option number two, he says is the mental... You're dropping so many good lines. It's so good.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.000]   Okay, I apologize. Somewhere between mythology and zoology.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.960]   This is all Terence McKenna. I take no credit for this.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.320]   But you're combining, you're like, Jimi Hendrix only used the blue scale, but he still created
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.200]   something new in the music he played. Anyway, go ahead.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   Well, we're going into Mixolydian right now. So, option number two, and this is what Terence calls
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.480]   sort of the mentalist reductionist approach. And this is pure McKenna poetry. He says that
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.760]   these beings could be autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily escaped
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:08.080]   the controlling power of the ego. So, in Jungian senses, these would just be pure projections.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   The projections of schizophrenics in some cases. So, they're essentially unreal.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.960]   And the third option, the most tantalizing, is that they're both non-physical, but autonomous.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.800]   In other words, they actually exist in some kind of real place, in some kind of real space,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.320]   and that we can have Congress with them. There is communication. He talks about the whisperings of
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:36.960]   the demon artificers, and that it's just possible that our meetings with these beings have coaxed
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.520]   the human species into self-expression in a very real way. That at different times in history,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.360]   our relationships with these semi-autonomous beings may actually guide the species.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   Now, this is high speculation, and Terence and Ralph and Rupert wind up talking about the early
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.800]   modern period and the scientific enlightenment, and that even someone like Descartes reports a
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.160]   dream in which he came face to face with an angel who said that the conquest of nature
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:16.560]   is to be achieved through measure and number. So, even the hard-minded materialist like Descartes
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.320]   is confronting these discarnate entities. John Dee in the 16th century, the high magician
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:29.440]   of the Elizabethan court, he reports decades worth of what we would say is extraterrestrial
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.400]   communication or interdimensional communication. And you can find instances of this throughout
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.680]   history, including among the pre-Socratics. And Peter Kingsley writes quite a bit about this,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.880]   but I'll save that until your next question. - Well, first of all, we don't seem to understand
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.520]   from where intelligence came from. We don't understand from where life came from on Earth,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.840]   but that we can kind of intuit, 'cause it's in the space of chemistry and biology,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.240]   you have good theories about the origins of life on Earth, but the origins of intelligent life,
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:07.680]   that is a giant mystery. And there's some sense in which, I mean, I don't know if you know the
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   movie "2001 Space Odyssey," but it does seem that there's like important, throughout human history,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.080]   throughout life on Earth, there's important phase shifts of, it feels like something happened
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:29.760]   where there's big leaps. It could be something coincidental like fire and learning how to cook
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.520]   meat and all those kinds of things, but it feels like there could be other things. And I think
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.600]   that's at the core of your work is exploring what those things could be. Is it possible?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:49.120]   Talked about Joe Rogan off-line. Is it, I mean, it's entirely possible. Is it possible that
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.560]   psychedelics have in fact contributed of being an important source of those phase shift throughout
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.640]   human history, of the intellect, basically steering the intellectual development and growth
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.880]   of human civilization? - It's a hypothesis worth
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.480]   investigating. How about that? - Beautiful.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   - And maybe not psychedelics in and of themselves, but I think our whole conversation is kind of
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   wrapped up in these non-ordinary states of awareness. We start by talking about God,
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:29.040]   which is something unordinary and expansive. And I think that as you trace the intervention
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.080]   of divinity, if that's the case, throughout human history, you have to bump up against the irrational.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:41.760]   Mircea Eliade, the great scholar of religions and fellow Romanian, said that the history of
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   religions essentially constitutes the point of intersection between metaphysics and biology,
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:53.760]   right? So that we are biological beings who do interact with our planet, with the natural kingdom.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.840]   And you would think that as early archaic ecologists, we would have figured out what
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.480]   plants work, which fungi don't, and developed maybe language around that. And so, this is another one
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:14.640]   of McKenna's speculative but very interesting hypotheses, the stone ape theory. Is it possible
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.920]   that psychedelics were involved in one of the several leaps forward? You mentioned the word
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   leap. Jared Diamond talks about the great leap forward 60,000 years ago. The species had been
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   around for a couple hundred thousand years. All of a sudden, the cave painting appears.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.360]   All of a sudden, there's a phase shift. Did something like that happen millions of years ago?
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.640]   And I love the way Paul Stamets talks about this. It would be the ingestion
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:47.040]   of perhaps psilocybin-containing fungi millions and millions of times over millions and millions
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.400]   of years. So, it's not just a one-time event that cascades, but it's the accumulation
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:59.920]   of psychedelic experience. It's really difficult to test that hypothesis. But I've been talking
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   with a paleoanthropologist in South Africa, my friend Lee Berger, about ways that we might test
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.400]   for this. And so, Lee, amongst many things, is this National Geographic explorer. He's the
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   paleoanthropologist's paleoanthropologist at the University of Whitwater-Shrind. He's famous amongst
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.200]   other things for the discovery of previously undiscovered hominids like Homo naledi.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:33.280]   And there's an interesting point. So, naledi is this archaic hominid, morphologically
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.920]   archaic, but it dates to about 300,000 years ago, which is very strange. What's even more
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.800]   strange about Homo naledi at the Rising Star Cave System there in South Africa is that Lee
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.920]   believes he's discovered the first bipedal ape deliberately disposing of its dead. So,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   there is a recognition of self-mortality and the practicing of rituals around death. We're
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:05.840]   talking about burials. And if you have burials, says Lee, in an archaic hominid 300,000 years ago,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   maybe you have language. And I mention that because Terence McKenna was obsessed
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.720]   with language in the stoned ape theory that the ingestion of psilocybin in addition to enhancing
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   visual acuity, perhaps facilitating sexual arousal, leads to proto-language. Now, isn't it
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:31.280]   interesting, this could be entirely a coincidence, that the largest sound inventory of any language
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.880]   is the Khoisan of Botswana and Namibia. They have something like 164 consonants and 44 vowels.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.000]   English, by comparison, has about 45. So, I don't know what to make of this, but what you find in
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.040]   that part of the world is very, very complex language. Language that could be an inheritance,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:57.520]   language that could be incredibly archaic, together with this recognition of self-mortality.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.440]   And when I talk to Lee Berger, we say, when you're looking at universals like that,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   language around all human populations, the recognition of self-mortality, the contemplation
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.400]   of death, just maybe you have pharmacology. And so, maybe we can go out and test for this
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.560]   using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, proteomics, technology that doesn't even exist,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.600]   but maybe we can actually test the stoned ape theory to figure out once and for all
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.240]   if there's any merit there. - Can you just linger a little bit
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   on the pharmacology tools? How would it be possible to say something about what was being ingested
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.880]   so, so long ago? - That's what I asked Dr. Berger.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.320]   So, Lee has discovered in the dental calculus of archaic hominids--
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.160]   - Nice. Dental calculus, I like this.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.800]   - Evidence of their diet. And you might not believe how old this was, but in Sadiba,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.520]   Australopithecus Sadiba, they found evidence of Sadiba's diet going back 2 million years.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.280]   So, through things like phytoliths, which are essentially fossilized plant tissue,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.560]   they found evidence that Sadiba was eating bark and leaves and grasses and fruits and palm.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.680]   So, no psychedelics to speak of, but it just goes to show that through things like
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   dental microware analysis and other techniques that we're still developing,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.880]   we can actually figure out what the diet was at the time. I'll fast forward to 50,000 years ago.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.040]   There was another study out of El Cidron Cave in 2012, which found that Neanderthals,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.080]   again, preceding our species, 50,000 years ago, were ingesting yarrow and chamomile,
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.040]   which had been identified as medicinal. So, again, not psychedelic or psychoactive, but
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.280]   we kind of have the beginnings of the technology, and that was nine years ago,
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.360]   to begin figuring out the ancestral diet of these hominids.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.480]   - Presumably, there could be a way to figure out, it's not just diet, but which have
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.560]   psychoactive elements to them. So, whether you're chewing it, whether you're smoking it,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.960]   whether, I mean, I don't know what, licking it. I don't know if there's any kind of ways
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.840]   through the dental calculus to figure out what exact substances were being consumed.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.160]   Is it possible to figure out whether psychedelic substances are being
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   consumed by looking at human behavior, like you said, organized burials or cave paintings?
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.880]   No, but so that's a little bit of a stretch to say, like, where did this leap come from?
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.480]   - But it's not. It's not. So, just last fall, as a matter of fact, so that notion's been out
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.440]   there for a while, the idea that hallucinogens and the ritual consumption of hallucinogens
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.160]   were somehow related to the Great Leap Forward, were somehow related to the initial cave painting.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.720]   Graham Hancock wrote a beautiful book about this called Supernatural, which in many ways, like,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.000]   sent me down this rabbit hole back in 2007. But even at the time when he was writing that,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.360]   and the years subsequent, it was still kind of seen as a kooky idea. Last fall,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:07.920]   interestingly enough, the first archaeochemical data for the ritual consumption of psychedelics
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.960]   associated with cave art was finally published. It's not that ancient. It's only about 400 or
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   500 years ago, but it came from the Pinwheel Cave, a chumash site in California. And what they found
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.720]   were datura quids, like these chewed up, you mentioned how they ingested, these chewed up quids,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.240]   like these bunches of datura, which contain these very powerful tropane
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.840]   alkaloids, in what was believed to be some kind of chumash initiation site. So, we can say that
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.280]   there is initial, you know, archaeochemical data for the consumption of psychedelics and cave art.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.400]   And so, where else might we find this? - Are there a lot of archaeochemists in the world?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.040]   - Like, 'cause this is fascinating, is through chemistry, through biology, through physics,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:01.120]   whatever, like all the disciplines we, perhaps in one day computer science, we apply those tools
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.040]   to study not the data of today, but the data of the past. Are we talking about dozens here?
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.880]   Like, how hard is this problem relative to how many people are taking it on,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.160]   just as a side little tangent? - We're probably talking
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.280]   more dozens than hundreds. I spent many years trying to track down an archaeochemist who would
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.360]   talk to me, there were a couple, Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, and then my friend
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.680]   Andrew Koh at MIT, which you might know something about. Andrew really, you know, on his own time,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   on his own dime, has been gathering the data for this organic residue analysis. He has what's
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.120]   called the OpenArcheM project, which is this online open source repository for this data.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.320]   But there's never been a center for this. No university has stood up a dedicated center,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.800]   a team, really, which is what you need of archaeochemists looking at this stuff. But,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.960]   I mean, even despite that, there have been some remarkable discoveries over the past 10,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.760]   20 years. It's still a discipline very much in its infancy, maybe it's becoming a toddler, but
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.000]   as the technology gets better and cheaper, I hope you'll see more and more archaeochemists
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.440]   joining the fight. - Yeah, and Andrew's fascinating,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.920]   his work is fascinating. But also, I just, because of your work, I came across and exchanged a few
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.280]   emails with Patrick McGovern, who's basically, what would you call him? So he has a center,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:34.720]   I guess, that does biomolecular archaeology at UPenn. And he's the author of a bunch of books,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:41.200]   one of which is ancient brews. So he's a scholar of beer and wine, and like ancient alcohol,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.080]   which is fascinating. The influence, even just alcohol, but he has like alcohol with
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.800]   hallucinogenic properties as well. But it's fascinating, as a Russian, it's fascinating
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:32:00.720]   to think about the influence of alcohol on the development of human civilization throughout
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.560]   its history. Is there something you can comment on alcohol, or in general,
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:15.120]   Patrick's work that was informative to you, inspiring, or kind of added to your conception
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.480]   of human history? - His work was some of the first
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.880]   hard scientific data that I saw for the ritual consumption of these intoxicants. I don't think
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:30.000]   he's ever found the hard and fast data for psychedelics, but what he turned me on to was
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.480]   this idea that alcohol, or beer and wine specifically, could have been used as vehicles
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.080]   for the administration of psychedelics. That's where it all started for me. Just the notion that
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.520]   ancient beer and ancient wine is very, very different from what we drink today, that typically,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:54.160]   they were cocktails. They were often fortified and mixed with different fruits, berries, herbs,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.760]   plants, maybe even fungi over time because this was all in the absence of distilled liquor. There
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:06.240]   is no hard alcohol, even in Russia, before maybe the 12th century it was in Europe,
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.520]   maybe a bit earlier. But the concept of distillation just didn't exist. And so,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:19.280]   to pack a punch, rather than just drink a kind of watered-down Budweiser, these people were
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.960]   interested in fortifying these beverages with whatever they could find in nature. And Pat,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.720]   to his credit, found some of the initial data for these, you could say, spiked wines and spiked
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.560]   beers. Not with anything overtly psychedelic, but just the fact that in the 16th century BC,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:42.880]   at Grave Circle A in Mycenae, there's this Minoan ritual cocktail of beer mixed with wine,
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.040]   mixed with mead, is very interesting. It's even more interesting that you find that
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:54.640]   across the Aegean in Gordium at King Midas' tomb, right? The same kind of ritual cocktail, which
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.680]   Pat and Sam at the Dogfish Head Brewery resurrected as the Midas touch. So, I mean,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.160]   the notion that we can go back, find this data, resurrect it, in some cases, 2,800 years later,
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   I found pretty exciting 10 years ago. - Yeah, bring it back for research.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.960]   - (laughs) - But that's fascinating that
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:20.240]   people were playing with these ideas. And we'll return to ideas of psychedelic-confused wine,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.560]   which is pretty fascinating. But can we step back and just kind of look at your work with
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.880]   the book "Immortality Key"? What is the story that you tell in this book?
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   - I knew it would get there eventually, Alex. (laughs)
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:39.760]   - It's a nonlinear path. Somehow, we were talking about simulation and the universe is a computer
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:46.640]   that's creating video games and wow and Fortnite, but we got there. And we'll return, always,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.400]   to the insane philosophical. But your book "Immortality Key," what's the story that you
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.680]   tell in this book? Which part of human history are you studying?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:02.800]   - Right, so that's the way to phrase it. So, it's my 12-year search for the hard scientific data
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.240]   for the ritual use of psychedelics in classical antiquity. So, we're talking about amongst the
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.800]   ancient Greeks and Romans and the paleo-Christians. So, the generations that would give birth to the
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   largest religion the world's ever known. Christianity today was two and a half billion
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.440]   people. The big question for me is, were psychedelics actually involved? There was a
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.480]   lot written about this in the '60s, John Marco Allegro. The book that I follow was published
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   in 1978 before I was born, "The Road to Eleusis" by Gordon Wasson, who we talked about already,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.880]   Albert Hoffman, who famously discovers LSD or synthesizes it from ergot, and Karl Ruck,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:47.920]   who is still a professor of classics at Boston University, the only surviving member of that
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:55.120]   renegade trio and now 85 years old. So, this all predates us. But what was lacking in the '60s,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.960]   '70s, '80s, '90s, I think was some of this technology and the hard scientific data.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.760]   Now, for years and years, I went out to the archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists around
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:11.040]   the world, and I asked a very basic question, "Is there any evidence for psychedelics in
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.160]   classical antiquity?" And the answer would almost invariably come back, "No." I'm talking to,
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.280]   in addition to Pat, he put me in touch with Hans-Peter Stieke in Germany, Tania Valamotti
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.480]   in Greece, Assunta Florenzano in Italy. I went all over the place asking one question and getting
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.960]   the same answer back time and again. And so, the book is essentially my search for that data and
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:41.280]   the eventual uncovering of two, what I think are key pieces of data. One data point shows the
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.080]   ritual use of a psychedelic beer in classical antiquity in Iberia, what today is Spain.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.680]   And the other shows what looks like a kind of psychedelic wine just outside Pompeii from the
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.360]   first century AD, at the right place, at the right time, when the earliest Christians were
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.600]   showing up in Italy. - Again, these are early steps in the search for evidence in the space,
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:15.360]   but speaking of early Christians, what role do you think psychedelic-infused wine could have played
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:24.400]   in the life of the... I won't be clever, in the life of Jesus Christ?
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:31.840]   - I've been saying recently that, and I hope this doesn't sound obscurantist, but I think it's
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.240]   impossible to understand Jesus and the birth of Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.760]   And I'll give you a very specific example of why I think that's the case.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.440]   - Interesting. - You can read the entire New Testament
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:53.360]   in ancient Greek, and not once will you ever find a reference to alcohol, because there was no word
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.400]   in ancient Greek for alcohol. The way the word sounds, alkol, it's Semitic, it comes from the
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:06.000]   Arabic. Kahla means to enliven or refresh, it probably comes from kohl, sort of these powdered
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.600]   metallics that were used in alchemical experiments and cosmetics. So again, that's much later in time
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:19.440]   when we're using alchemy, distillation, etc. In the 1st century AD, the power of wine wasn't
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   necessarily tied to alcohol, fermented grapes, the way we think about wine today. So Pat McGovern
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.360]   found some of that early organic data for wine being mixed with beer and with mead. But if you
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.720]   look at the literature from the 1st century AD, Dioscorides, for example, he writes this massive
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.480]   treatise at the exact same time the Gospels are being written. And Dioscorides, in just one of
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.600]   his books, talks about 56 detailed recipes for spiking wine with all kinds of things, like
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.960]   salvia and hellebore and frankincense and myrrh, these spiced perfumes, but also more dangerous
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   things like henbane and mandrake, which he says in Greek can be fatal with just one cupful.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:10.960]   And in Book 474 of his Materia Medica, he talks about black nightshade producing fantasias
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:18.880]   ou aedes, not unpleasant visions, what today we would say is psychedelic. So just looking at the
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.920]   literature and the kind of literature that even most classicists--I didn't really learn it in
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:31.120]   undergrad, I came across Dioscorides later--but just a basic look at the literature supports
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.160]   what McGovern has been testing, which is the fact that wine was routinely mixed
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.880]   with different compounds. - It's fascinating, by the way,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.960]   that language affects our conception of the tools we use to understand the world. So like,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:56.720]   you can see wine, you can see psychedelics, if they're not called drugs, you can maybe reframe
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.400]   how you see them in terms of their role in us thinking about the world, understanding the world.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.800]   That's really interesting that language has that power. But what language was used to understand
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:13.680]   wine at the time? - So we're talking about a Greek-speaking world, right? So Jesus is born
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.520]   and does his public ministry in the Holy Land, but think about the early Church. Think about where
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.320]   the Church takes root. Paul, the greatest evangelist of the time, writes basically half
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:29.040]   the New Testament. He's writing letters in Greek to Greek speakers in places like Corinth in Greece,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:35.120]   or Philippi, a defunct city just north of the island of Thassos. Or he's writing to
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.560]   folks in what today is Turkey, the Colossians, the Galatians. He writes letters to the Romans.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.000]   These are Greek speakers in these pockets, these Hellenic pockets all around the ancient
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.680]   Mediterranean. And for them, again, ignore Dioscorides, ignore Pat McGovern's work.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:58.240]   To them, to think about wine was to think about a mixed potion. And so the word oinos in ancient
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.520]   Greek does show up in the New Testament, but there was another word to describe wine. And it exists
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:09.840]   for like a thousand years, before, during, and after the life of Jesus. The word used for wine
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.680]   is pharmakon, which obviously gives us the word pharmacy. It means drug. So in Greek, a Greek
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   speaker would actually use the word drug to refer to wine. Ruth Skodal, the classicist, talks about
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   this as a ritualistic formula. They understood wine as this compound beverage, a drug against
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:37.520]   grief, a medicinal elixir that could either harm or heal, or just maybe a sacrament to put you in
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:46.720]   touch with wine gods old and new. - Clearly, religion, and myth, but religion very much so has
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:57.680]   sort of a, much like dreams, has like an imagery component. Like, you're kind of going outside the
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:05.120]   visual constraints of physical space where you kind of have very specific conceptions of what
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   things look like, and you kind of use your imagination to stretch beyond the world as
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.720]   we know it. Things that are, try to get in touch with things that are more real than real.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:27.040]   What role do these tools, do these pharmakons have in trying to stimulate the imagery of religion?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.480]   Do you have a sense that they have a critical role here, or is this just a bunch of different
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.440]   factors that are utilized, a bunch of different tools that are utilized to construct this imagery?
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   Or is this not even, or is imagery the wrong terminology? Is it more like a space of ideas
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.960]   that's core to religion? - No, I think the wine is absolutely essential. And so if it's impossible
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.480]   to understand paleo-Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek, I think it's equally difficult
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.640]   in the absence of the sacred pharmacopeia, or wine itself, right? Just think about wine
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:06.160]   at the time. I think that the ancient Greek audience would have heard that in a very different
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.320]   way from us. And so they're referring to it maybe as a pharmakon, but the followers of Dionysus,
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.640]   which precedes Jesus. And in some cases, the story of Jesus is kind of a recapitulation of the
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.000]   mysteries of Dionysus. But when you think about Dionysus, maybe from your high school mythology,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.880]   you think about him as the god of theater, or the god of wine, which is typically what it is,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:36.400]   or the god of ecstasy. Again, Dionysus is not the god of alcohol. There's no concept
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:42.880]   of fermented grapes. The power of Dionysus and the ability to commune with Dionysus through his blood,
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:49.920]   and before Christianity, the blood of Dionysus is equated to his wine. The sacramental drinking of
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.320]   the wine was interpreted, and classicists write about this, including Walter Burkert,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:00.640]   it was interpreted as consuming the god himself in order to become one with the god. This is where
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.680]   we get the idea of enthusiasm because the language matters, enthusiasm to be filled
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.360]   with the spirit of the god so that you became identified with Dionysus and acquired his divine
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.240]   powers. Now, how does that happen? Again, he's not the god of alcohol. He is the god of wine,
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.960]   but he's really the god of madness and delirium and frenzy. And his principal followers are women.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.680]   They're called the minads. And the way they get in touch with him is through the consumption of
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:34.960]   this sacramental wine. Even at the theater of Dionysus, separate from his outdoor churches,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:40.480]   there was a wine served there called drima. And this is the wine that gives birth to Hollywood.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.800]   I mean, the ancient Hollywood was there at the theater of Dionysus. This is where comedy and
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.840]   tragedy and poetry and music come from. But rather than a hot dog and a beer, what they drink at the
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:56.400]   theater of Dionysus was this wine called drima, which means pounded or rubbed. And Professor Ruck
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.960]   talks about maybe it was the drugs that were rubbed into this theatrical beverage to help the
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.400]   play come alive. So madness is seen as a positive thing, as like a creative journey.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:15.520]   It's not, it's not, it's the, what is it, the unlearning, getting out of the way kind of thing.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   Is that how it's seen or is it more like
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.640]   entertaining escape from life that is suffering?
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:30.000]   I gotta inject a little modern Dostoevsky into the old.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.240]   Existential despair. Maybe it's a bit of that. We can't say that there wasn't
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:46.080]   recreational drinking happening. The Greeks also had the symposium, right? And they also were just
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:53.280]   getting hammered in some cases. But when it comes to the rites of Dionysus, what you see there is
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:01.120]   the creation of these states of awareness in which again, you identify with the God to become the
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.800]   God. There's theophagy, there's the consumption of divinity in order to become divinity. Right back
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.280]   to how we started the conversation, right? So if we stop conceiving of God as something exterior to
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:19.600]   us, but that the mystery of being itself is the mystery of your being and the mystery of my being,
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:26.480]   that the way to encounter that is through the sacramental theology, that you drink the actual
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.800]   blood of this Greek God to become that God. And there was a place for this in ancient Greek society.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.720]   So drinking the wine is drinking the blood of Dionysus. Do you think Jesus is
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:50.400]   an actual physical person that existed in history or is he an idea that came to life
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.000]   through the consumption of wine and those kinds of rituals?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.360]   So this is where I face my excommunication, depending how I answer this.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.200]   I mean, you're playing with fire and wine.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.240]   A good combination, by the way.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:14.400]   Yeah. So I shy away from that controversy in the book. I'm perfectly willing to accept Jesus
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.440]   as a historical personage. We have the multiplicity of sources, although it's a
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.280]   generation after his death, but we have the Eucharist being described in the four gospels,
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:31.520]   we have it being described by Paul in 1 Corinthians. But when you read John, it does
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.840]   read a bit differently than the other gospels. And in my book, I rely a lot on the scholarship
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:41.520]   of Dennis MacDonald, who writes a fabulous book called The Dionysian Gospel. And this is, again,
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.680]   why the Greek matters, because once you start to analyze the Greek of John's gospel,
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:52.480]   it seems to be a presentation of Jesus very much in the guise of Dionysus. The most obvious example
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.160]   is the wedding at Cana, right? That only occurs in John's gospel, the famous transformation of
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.280]   water into wine. Now, again, to any Greek speaker of the first century, they would have known about
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:10.320]   the Greek district of Elis on the Peloponnese. And in Elis, around the Epiphany, every January,
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:16.720]   the priests of Dionysus would deposit these water basins, empty basins, in the temple of Dionysus.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.400]   They'd return the next morning and find them magically filled with wine. Now, on the island
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.280]   of Andros, it's even more interesting. Around the same Epiphany date, the God's gift day,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   Dies Theodosia, the wine would emanate from the temple and run like a river for a week. And you
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:39.040]   can Google the Bacchanal of the Andrians, a wonderful painting by Titian, which hangs in
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.920]   the Prado, and you'll see a river of wine behind these people having a great time. This exists for
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.560]   centuries and centuries before the wedding at Cana and before Jesus begins his public ministry
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:56.800]   with what these scholars call the signature miracle of Dionysus. It would not have been lost
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.040]   on the Greek audience that something very specific is being communicated here.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:07.520]   What's being communicated? That you just might find in early Christianity what you hold strong
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.400]   to in these mysteries of Dionysus that you may have inherited from your parents, your grandparents,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   your great-grandparents for centuries. There was a perfectly good religion. There were perfectly
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.960]   good mystery cults in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. And here comes this new, untested,
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:29.680]   illegal cult, illegal, of a dozen or so illiterate day laborers that go on to convert the empire
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:36.160]   in a few hundred years. The answer to that extraordinary growth is not psychedelics,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.720]   but I do think it's visionary experiences, and I do think it's this continuity from the pagan
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.640]   world into early Christianity. - So what part, you mentioned this idea,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:51.760]   that's really interesting, I think you said Paul Stamets, of, I guess, millions of people over
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:59.680]   millions of years kind of consuming, really practicing a ritual or a habit of some sort.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:05.280]   This idea of rituals is kind of interesting. Again, you mentioned cult. What's the role of
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:12.640]   ritual consumption of some of these substances or just ritual practice of anything in the
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.800]   intellectual growth of particular groups of people or societies?
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:23.360]   - So again, I would say it is the centerpiece of ancient life, not just the mysteries of Dionysus,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.760]   which we've only talked a bit about, but the mysteries of Eleusis were probably the most
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.200]   famous and longest-lasting of these Greek mystery rites. And I mean, just to put it in simple terms,
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:38.880]   the best definition for a mystery religion, as the name implies, is something secret. Right,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:44.160]   muo from the Greek means to shut the eyes or to shut the mouth, to keep quiet about this stuff.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.640]   We're always teasing details from the archaeological and the literary record,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:57.600]   and we're kind of just grabbing at these secrets. But Eleusis, which survives for like 2000 years
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:05.840]   into the Christian period from about 1500 BC to the 4th century AD, it's kind of this centerpiece
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.440]   of Greek life. Cicero, the great Roman statesman, calls what was happening at Eleusis the most
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:17.920]   exceptional and divine thing that Athens ever produced. So not democracy, the arts and sciences,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:25.200]   or philosophy, but the vision that was encountered at Eleusis, perhaps through the ritual consumption
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.480]   of a potent psychedelic over hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands and thousands,
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.680]   if not millions of initiates, pilgrims who would walk from Athens to Eleusis to encounter this
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:42.080]   vision. It seems to have been not just an important part of Greek life, but the thing that
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:48.480]   made life livable, such that as these mysteries are about to be exterminated by the newly
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:54.080]   Christianized Roman Empire, there's this passage in the ancient literature that talks about these,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.000]   in the absence of these mysteries, life becomes unlivable. Abiotos.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.440]   Is there ways you can, I mean, you write about the mysteries of Eleusis, and is there ways you
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:11.520]   can convert that into words? Why those are so important to them, more important than any other
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   invention to them? Why is it such a source of meaning to life? So from what we can reconstruct,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.280]   they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles northwest of Athens to confront their mortality.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:30.640]   Remember we were talking about homo naledi, and in South Africa, this recognition of self-mortality,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:38.640]   the deliberate disposal of the dead. Plato talks about the real practice of philosophy being the
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:45.760]   death and dying process. So in some senses, you went to Eleusis to die and to experience a death
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.520]   before your death. We talked about this with Terence McKenna as well, how the psychedelic state
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.640]   seems to share something in common with the near-death or out-of-body experiences or these
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.160]   ecstatic experiences, whether through wine or beer or otherwise, you went to Eleusis to die.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.320]   And it was said that only those who had witnessed this vision, whatever vision was to be witnessed
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:15.040]   in Demeter's sanctuary, it essentially vouchsafed you the afterlife, that only those who went there
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.920]   became immortal. And Cicero says that at that point, you essentially live with more joy and
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:28.320]   die with a better hope. Can I ask you a question about this human contention with death, this
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:34.800]   confrontation of death that seems to be at the core of things. I don't know how deep to the core,
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:42.880]   but it seems to be a central element of the human condition. What do you think about Ernest Becker
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:52.560]   and those guys that put death at the, what is it, the warm of the core, which as the main thing,
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:59.040]   the main, like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all, being understand that
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:06.800]   we're mortal and then confronting the terror of it, the fear of it as the creative, like trying
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.760]   to escape the fear of death as the creative force of human society. It's like the reason we do
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:22.240]   anything is because we're just running away from our death scared. Do you find some of that to be
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:27.680]   true? First of all, as somebody who looks in the mirror, looks at yourself and your own as a human
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:34.800]   being to just looking at society today and three at this whole big spread of human history and all
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:40.320]   the cool stuff we've created, including the mysteries of elusives. I wonder what life would
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:47.280]   look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality. I wonder how we'd interact with one
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.800]   another if there was relatively little or no fear of death. I really do when it comes to Becker's
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.880]   work and others. If the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death. It was the
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.600]   opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the immortality key, by the way, it's not psychedelics
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.160]   but when I refer to this key, I'm referring to this notion that's preserved in Greek.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:14.560]   "An pethanis, brin pethanis, dentha pethanis, ot an pethanis." If you die before you die,
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   you won't die when you die. For some reason, the ancients prized that experience. And we talked
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:29.200]   about the mystics of Sufism and Kabbalism and Christian mysticism where you have this same
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   self-nodding, this death before death, the divine nothingness. For some reason, the mystics, saints,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:40.560]   visionaries, and ancient philosophers, they ran to death. And the one message I wanted to try
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:46.960]   and communicate with this book is how they viewed life, that it can only be fully experienced,
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:55.680]   fully embodied in the wake of a really intense, perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:03.200]   encounter with death. - So running to death, not running away from death. You talk about Aldous
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:14.080]   Huxley and mind changers. So if we look at the history where the ancients were running to death
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:23.760]   and maybe using some performance enhancing permacons to run more effectively towards death.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:31.680]   And now we're using tools of modern society, whether they're psychological, sociological,
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:39.600]   or in case pharmaceutical, to run away from this conception. So what do you see as a hopeful future
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:48.800]   for human civilization? If all of these kinds of societies are ice cream flavors, how do you
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.400]   create the perfect ice cream flavor? What is the future of religious experience, of psychedelic
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:01.200]   experience, of intellectual journeys, of facing death, running away from death? What do you hope
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:07.040]   that looks like and what kind of idea should we look to? - My next book will be entitled
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:14.880]   "Performance Enhancing Farmaca." (laughs) You get full copyright. - Yeah, I like it.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.120]   But that's a historical view. I mean, what in that book would you suggest in one of the last
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:30.880]   chapters about the future of this process? - Well, Huxley has to stop you. He stopped me
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   in my tracks, Aldous Huxley. So in 1958, he pens this op-ed of sorts. And it reads incredibly
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:46.640]   prescient because I really do think in many ways as the fog of the war drug is ending
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:54.000]   and finally lifting that we've kind of come full circle back to the late 1950s,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.560]   which might sound strange. It'll make more sense when you hear what Huxley said about psychedelics.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.640]   And so he was looking forward to a revival of religion, which is why I subtitled the book
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:12.720]   "The Religion with No Name." And to him, to Huxley, this revival wouldn't come about through
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:19.280]   televangelistic mass meetings or photogenic clergymen, as he says. But he points to the
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:26.080]   biochemical discoveries such as we have today that would allow for large numbers of men and women to
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:32.000]   achieve a radical self-transcendence and a deeper understanding of the nature of things. In other
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.880]   words, that this revival of religion, he says, would be a revolution. And Alan Watts comes along
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.320]   and says that there's nothing more dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.760]   But I think this is what Huxley was pointing to. And he talks about religion in these terms,
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:56.560]   about being less about symbols and returning to a sense of experience and intuition. And Huxley
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:04.160]   says that he envisions a religion which gives rise to everyday mysticism. And he talks about
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:09.360]   something that would undergird everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties,
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:17.040]   and everyday human relationships. In other words, religion has to mean something. And these altered
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   states of awareness that we seem to be able to produce quite easily inside the lab at Hopkins,
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:30.240]   NYU, and elsewhere with psilocybin, I think this is kind of part of Huxley's prediction about a
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:37.520]   time when we would have legal access, safe access, efficacious access to this material that would
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:44.560]   allow for insight in an afternoon. And what do you do when millions of people can become mystics
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:50.320]   in an afternoon? - So psychedelics, psilocybin
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:57.920]   might be the practical way of having these kinds of, maybe could be termed religious experiences.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.840]   And then many people partake in those experiences and then like evolving this collective
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.280]   intelligence thing we got going on, that's sort of the practice of religion that we should be
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:15.040]   looking at striving for, as opposed to kind of operating in the space of ideas, actually
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:24.560]   practicing it. You mentioned, and that's the religion with no name, the use of these tools.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:31.360]   Is there a simple way to summarize religion for our previous discussion about God, basically
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.200]   discovering the God inside? - What if I give you a very complicated
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.840]   definition of religion, and then we talk about a more simplified?
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.880]   - Let's do it. - So the most complicated we can get on this
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.720]   is the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz. But I think it's worth defining our terms
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.560]   when we're talking about God and religion. So religion, religio from the Latin means to bind
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.880]   back. So to bind us back to some meaningful tradition, to bind us back to the source.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.520]   Here's a mouthful from Clifford Geertz. Religion, he defines as a set of symbols,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.280]   which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.960]   by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions in such
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:22.880]   an aura of factuality that those moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic, which is
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.800]   complex. What does that mean? That religion has to make you feel something, these moods and
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.040]   motivations. But it can't just do that in the way that sex does that for us, or sports, or ultimate
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:42.000]   fighting, or the World Cup, or going to a concert. So we get all that emotion in these experiences
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.240]   like that. But that emotion has to be concomitant to a deep existential insight that answers this
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.760]   question for you in the morning. I know why I'm here. I know why humans are here. I think I know
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.600]   what the meaning of life is. That's what religion is. And if you find that meaning in science,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.000]   then that's your religion and that's fine. But we need to be more honest about that.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.840]   If your epistemological model is weighing facts and figures and you think that's why you're here
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.880]   on this planet and you find deep meaning, that's okay. Religion is the thing that makes you feel,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   right? It has the aura of factuality. It just makes you feel like you know the point behind
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.680]   existence. In other words, I think it comes down to experience like Joe Campbell was talking about,
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.480]   like Aldous Huxley mentions about experience and intuition. I think this is how we connect to God.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:38.800]   - Make you feel like you understand the world. I mean, so that's kind of bigger than science.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:47.040]   That includes science, but it's bigger. Do you think, what is real? Like, do you think there's
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:53.360]   an absolute reality that we're kind of striving towards understanding or is it all just conjured
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:00.400]   up in our minds? And that's the whole kind of point. We together create these realities and
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.840]   play with them and dance to somehow derive meaning from those realities. And it's ultimately not
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:15.520]   like very deeply integrated into what's like into atoms of space-time.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.320]   - Another easy question, Lex.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:27.920]   - Well, I mean, you have to kind of, when you're thinking about emotion and making it concrete
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:36.080]   into something that feels real, you have to start asking like, what is real? It's something that,
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.040]   you know, Ben Shapiro has this saying of facts don't care about your feelings.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.720]   I was always uncomfortable with this. I mean, he's just being spiffy or whatever, but
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.080]   I was always uncomfortable with somehow, first that the hubris of thinking that humans can
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:02.480]   have like arrive at absolute truth, which is what I assume he means by facts,
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:09.040]   like things that are controvertible. And then somehow deriding feelings, like feelings are
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:18.400]   not important. To me, like the whole thing is reality. The facts don't even like facts is reality,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:25.040]   feelings are reality. Like the entirety of human experience is reality. All these consciousnesses
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.240]   somehow interacting together, making up random crap and together agreeing, they're all going
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.680]   to wear the same colors, rooting for one football team or the other football team or countries,
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.520]   all those things, that's real because we've agreed that it's real. And in the same way,
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:48.000]   it gives us meaning. In that same way, religion is a set of ideas that gives us meaning. But,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.680]   you know, real, it's really a difficult, for me as a scientist, that finds comfort
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.240]   in the physical understanding of the universe, of physics. You know, I love physics. I love
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.760]   computer science. It makes me feel like everything is perfectly understandable.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:16.320]   And then I look at humans, they're totally not understandable. It's like a giant mess,
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:22.560]   but that's part of the beauty. Like what is love? Like what the hell is love? It's certainly not
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:29.600]   like a weird hack to convince me to procreate because it feels something bigger than that.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.600]   So like taking a purely evolutionary biologist perspective, it's missing the, it's not missing,
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:42.240]   it's only capturing a part of the picture. So it just keeps making me ask, what is real? Because
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.320]   as a human, it's very human centric. It does certainly feel like
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.600]   a part, a big part of what is real is all the fake stuff my mind makes up.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.760]   I mean, okay, I guess, is there something you could say
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:09.680]   from our discussions about the tools of psychedelics, about our discussion about religion,
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.600]   of what is real, of what is reality?
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   These are largely unanswerable questions.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.720]   But we should nevertheless strive to answer them. That's the whole point of the human experience.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.880]   And I think science is one way and religion is another. And I think there's actually a sphere
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:33.920]   where they intersect. There's a way for religion to be observable, testable, repeatable, falsifiable.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.840]   When I look at the ancient mysteries, that's what I find. I think I find people exploring alternate
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.360]   states of consciousness and arriving at conclusions based on that exploration and deriving
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.080]   deep meaning from that, which yes, are feelings and emotions and very hard to quantify. But
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.400]   nonetheless, these are the things that govern our lives. I mean, I don't know a parent who isn't
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:02.240]   motivated by the love of their children. Everything I do at 40 years old now is pretty much inspired
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.200]   by my love for my two daughters. And I can't prove to you that I love them. I can say it,
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.640]   I can show you behavior, but it's very hard for me to weigh and measure that. So not everything
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:21.280]   is so reducible to this quantifiable reality. And yet, I also love science. And I love the
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.440]   historical process of weighing this data. I love the chemistry. I love the biology.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:32.080]   And for me, I think this was the message of the ancient Greeks. And I think this is the world in
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:37.600]   which paleo-Christianity was born. I think there is this meeting ground between science and religion
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   which allow for the, if not the discovery, then at least the near-identification of the
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.400]   ultimate reality, which is another way to describe God, right? This being of beings,
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.280]   the transcendent mystery. - So speaking of God,
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:01.280]   you mentioned to me offline you're wearing the most sophisticated clothing choice
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.960]   of the elite intellectuals. Like you mentioned, Sam Harris was wearing a hoodie.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.200]   - This is the Sam Harris hoodie. He's starting a trend.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:14.640]   - He's starting a trend. (laughs) This is a new religion, you could even say. It's a ritual.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:22.320]   It's a ritual practice of intellectuals of searching for meaning. So there's quite a
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:29.760]   fascinating debate. He was for a time still known as one of the sort of new age atheists.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.520]   So he was kind of trying to explore the role of religion in society and the role of science.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.800]   And then on the other side, another kind of powerhouse intellectual is Jordan Peterson,
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:49.200]   who in sometimes for my taste, a bit too poetic of ways is exploring the ideas of religion.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.440]   And they had these interesting debates that I think will continue about the role of religion
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:06.880]   in society. For Jordan, there's all these flaws with religion, but there is a lot of value to be
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:13.920]   discovered amidst the rituals, the traditions, the practice, the way we conceive of each other
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:21.120]   because of the ideas that religion propagates. And then for Sam, it says that everything about
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:30.320]   religion basically gets in the way of us fully realizing our human potential, which is deeply
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:40.800]   scientific and rational and sort of like we're surrounded by mystery. Calling that mystery God
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.400]   is getting in the way of us understanding that mystery. What do you think about this debate
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.240]   about the role of religion in society? We should continue having this debate. I talked to Jordan
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   a couple of weeks ago, as a matter of fact. Excellent. On his podcast? Yes. Excellent.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.120]   It'll be out soon. And so, he and I- How did that go, by the way?
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.320]   It was incredible. Karl Ruck, the professor, joined us, as a matter of fact, for one of his
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.400]   rare public appearances. Beautiful.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.840]   We went deep. And Jordan is very well-read, obviously, on the psychedelic literature. He
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.360]   had just had Roland Griffiths from Hopkins on the podcast. And it's one of Roland's figures
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.880]   that Jordan and I, again, just like the language of Aldous Huxley, it's hard to move past the
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.120]   following statistic. Over the past 20 years of the modern study of psilocybin, Roland will tell
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.520]   you that about three in four of their volunteers walk away from their single dose of psilocybin,
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.040]   high dose, saying it was among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:53.600]   if not the most meaningful. And Jordan says, "What do you do with that? How do we synthesize that?"
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:02.640]   You know, here we are quantifying the qualifiable, the unqualifiable, and yet these compounds have
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:08.880]   dramatic effects on people's lives, and they walk away feeling like they're more loving,
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:16.320]   more compassionate. The Science of All talks about the welling up of cooperation and resource
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.360]   sharing and kindness and all these strange things from this single chemical intervention,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:28.080]   which seems to reduce us to automata as if enlightenment can be flipped on like a switch.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.520]   And yet there it is, there's the data. And I don't see how you walk away from that. I mean,
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.920]   I completely understand Sam's position, but I think there's a reading of religion,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.440]   particularly the mystical core of the big faiths and especially these ancient mystery cults,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.240]   which do speak again to those moods and motivations creating this aura of factuality
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.600]   that these volunteers never walk away from, permanently transformed just like the ancient
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.200]   mysteries. And part of that is perhaps language, that we need to continue to evolve language in
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:11.040]   how we conceive of these processes. Maybe religion has a bunch of baggage associated with it that
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.920]   is good to let go of, or perhaps not. I don't know. This is connected to our previous
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.680]   part of our conversation is the importance of language in this whole thing.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.320]   Well, that's how I start my book with one of these volunteers from the NYU psilocybin experiments,
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.480]   this woman, Dinah Dinah Baser, who's an atheist, and she still describes herself as an atheist.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.080]   And yet as one of these three and four people who walked away from this experiment transformed,
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.520]   she says that her experience of psilocybin was like being bathed in God's love from an atheist.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.080]   Yes.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:49.840]   And I asked her why she uses the word God, why not the love of the cosmos or the universe or
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.560]   mother nature? And she says, "Well, frankly, we don't know about any of this stuff and that
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:01.120]   God makes sense to me." She's still an atheist, but it's the way she describes that as kind of like
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.040]   the way your mother's love must've felt when you were a baby.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.720]   Yeah, I like the way Einstein uses God, God doesn't play dice. There's a poetry,
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.600]   there's a humility that you don't know what the hell is going on. There's a humor to it.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.840]   I'm a huge fan, especially like more and more of just kind of having a big old laugh at the
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:29.360]   absurdity of this world and this life as represented nicely by memes on Twitter kind of thing.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:35.920]   I mean, there's a sense in which we want to be playing with these words and not take them so
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.560]   seriously and being a little bit lighthearted and explore. Let me ask you about, because you
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:51.120]   mentioned NYU, what I find fascinating is how much amazing research, speaking of science, right?
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.240]   Studying the effects of psilocybin, studying the effects of various psychedelics, MDMA
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:05.600]   on the human mind. Right now for helping people, but I'm hoping there'll be studies soon at Hopkins
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:12.400]   and elsewhere that allow people that are kind of more quote unquote creatives or regular people
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.160]   that don't have a particular demon they're trying to work through, a problem they're trying to work
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:25.760]   through, but more like to see what can I find if I utilize psychedelics to explore? Is there something
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   you could say that is exciting to you, that's promising about the future, what currently is
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   going on, but also the future of psychedelics research at Hopkins and elsewhere? Yeah, the
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.120]   healthy normals, the healthy normals. I was looking for the right words because normal doesn't feel,
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.280]   healthy doesn't feel like a good term and normal doesn't feel like a good term because we're all
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.240]   pretty messed up and we're all weird. Well, those with ontological angst in that case.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.000]   Great. Maybe there'll be a future DSM qualification. There's no doubt that things
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.800]   like psilocybin, MDMA are useful for things like anxiety, depression, end of life distress, PTSD,
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.280]   alcoholism, you name it. And it's largely because of the clinical research that MDMA and psilocybin
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.520]   will probably be legal in some FDA regulated way in the next five years. But I mean, again,
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.280]   I start the first page of my book with this question, why do psychedelics work across all
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:29.520]   these different conditions? And the best that I could find is the meaning, right? Tony Boss at NYU
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.040]   talks about psilocybin, for example, as meaning making medicine, which is interesting because
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:42.080]   it puts it somewhere between a therapeutic and again, this ontological instigator. What is it
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.000]   about psychedelics that creates these mystical experiences or mystical like experiences? You
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.680]   can call them emotional breakthroughs, you can call them moments of awe. I do think we get locked
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.640]   up in the language and we're somewhere between science and religion here, including legally.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.920]   So the FDA is one route to this. What excites me about psychedelics is the first amendment.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.080]   What is this going to mean for religion? The freedom of religion being the first thing that's
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:13.440]   mentioned in the first amendment before freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. If America is known
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.920]   for anything, it's a refuge for religious pioneers. And so we already have the Native American church,
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.520]   Brazilian spawn churches that are using psychedelics, but what would happen if Judaism
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.480]   or Christianity or Islam were to begin incorporating the very ritual, very sacred
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:39.120]   and discreet use of psychedelics as part of their liturgy? So not replacing the Sunday Eucharist in
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:45.520]   the case of Christianity, but part of the extra credit dimension of the faith.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.400]   Credit. And then we can, through practice, figure out how essential it is. It could be a minor
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.680]   thing, it could be a major thing. That's another thing I wanted to kind of ask you is I recently,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.000]   despite the fact that I'm eating a huge amount of meat and I'm getting fat, I'm loving it.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.160]   This is actually, as of two days ago, I started this long road to training for David Goggins,
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:14.560]   to training back to getting back to competing in jiu-jitsu. So the fun is over, but I also
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:22.400]   partook in fasting and there was a very strong, there's an almost like a hallucinogenic aspect
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.320]   of fasting, especially because it was a 72 hour fast versus a more common fast that I do,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:36.240]   which is 24 hours. And a bunch of people talk about throughout history about the value of fasting
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:43.760]   in having these kind of visual, these kind of intellectual experiences. Also there's meditation,
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:54.000]   Sam Harris with the hoodie. Do you have a sense that those other rituals of fasting, of meditation,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.800]   and maybe other things could be as essential or more essential to the religious experience
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.560]   as psychedelics? - Yes, if not, and this is gonna sound weird, but maybe not if more so.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:14.480]   I look at psychedelics as a catalyst for spiritual investigation, not as the superficial means to an
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:22.320]   end. I think their value is in kind of serving as a Google Maps for the kingdom of heaven.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:31.600]   - All right, I like this. - Well, so Ram Dass' teacher said that when he was offered psychedelics
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.000]   that it'll get you in the room with Jesus, but it won't keep you there.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.600]   - Yeah. - And I think that's all well and good,
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.120]   but what if you don't know where the house is in the first place? What if you've never had
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.960]   a mystical experience? What if religion is anathema to you? What if you hate God? What
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.720]   if all these words mean nothing to you? And they probably do for many, many people,
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.160]   and it's perfectly understandable. I think that we've lost the coordinates to these irrational
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.440]   states, again, that were prized throughout antiquity and that continue to be prized by
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.240]   the mystical communities even in big organized religion. It just doesn't filter out that much.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:17.440]   And so, psychedelics, in my mind, help orient our minds, bodies, and souls towards the irrational,
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:23.920]   right? We talked about McKenna's invisible world that seems to have this symbiosis with our own
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:31.120]   and perhaps has this higher intent for us. You could very well just take catalog of your dreams,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.920]   right? And that would do it too. But psychedelics seem to be particularly fast-acting,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.920]   particularly potent, and very reliable, especially in the clinical studies. And so,
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:47.760]   I looked at them as biochemical discoveries, like Huxley did. Maybe it's once in your life
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.680]   or infrequently, right? But maybe that's the beginning of a genuine introspection
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.360]   and a life well-examined, as the ancients always instructed us.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.640]   - Yeah, it does seem in the research that the effectiveness of psychedelics always comes with
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:09.520]   the integration where you use it, just like you said, as a catalyst for thinking through stuff.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:17.120]   It's not going to be... I don't even know if Google Maps... Oh, maybe Google Maps is the right
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:23.600]   analogy, but it doesn't do the driving for you. You still have to do the driving. It just kind of
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:30.320]   gives you the directions. So, after you come down from the trip or whatever, you still have to drive.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.160]   There's other tools that are kind of interesting. We've been talking about this
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.160]   at the psychological level, but there's also a neuroscience perspective of it. If we kind of like
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   go past the skull into the brain with the neurons firing, there's ideas of brain-computer interfaces.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.280]   First of all, there's a whole field of neuroscience that's kind of zooming in and
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.960]   studying the firing of the brain, the firing of the neurons in the brain, of how from those
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.280]   neurons emerges all the things that we think that make us human. That's a fascinating exploration
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:07.040]   of the human mind. That's, of course, where the psychedelics have the chemical, the biochemical
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.520]   effects on those neurons. There's ideas of brain-computer interfaces, which,
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.240]   you know, if you look at, especially what Neuralink is doing with this long-term vision
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:26.880]   with Elon Musk and Neuralink, they hope to expand... He calls it a wizard hat.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:38.080]   This is back to the humor on the internet thing. The wizard hat that expands the
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.880]   capabilities, the capacity of the human mind. Do you think there's something there, or
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:54.080]   is the human mind so infinitely complex that we're quite a long way away from
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:02.240]   expanding the capabilities of the human mind through technology versus something like psychedelics?
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.720]   I wonder how Terence McKenna would answer that question. He looked to shamans as kind of the
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:15.280]   scientists, the high magicians of the high archaic past and the far-flung future.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.400]   I'm not going to discount... You know more about AI than I do, so I'm not going to discount it,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:32.880]   but I do think that AI paired with the sacred recovery, right? The archaeology of consciousness
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.400]   and these states, these archaic techniques of ecstasy that were practiced across time,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.520]   I think that's a winning combination. You know, part of what I do in the book is just
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.920]   I try and lay out the set and setting. That's often talked about with psychedelics. I mean,
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.360]   so maybe psychedelics in the right AI environment is going to work. I think it'd probably work a lot
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.760]   better with that myth and ritual incorporated. So, the reason elusives worked for 2000 years,
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:06.160]   and let's assume the psychedelic hypothesis has some merit to it, but I think the reason it worked
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   is because you were born into a mythology. You were born into a story about Demeter and Persephone,
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.680]   and you waited your entire life to meet them in the flesh. So, you weren't just preparing
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:23.840]   for a few months. It was a lifetime of expectation, anticipation, ritual preparation.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:29.360]   In fact, some of the early church fathers made fun of the Greeks for essentially just piquing
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:34.080]   people's curiosity and revving up the anticipation, which has something to do with the outcome,
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.640]   by the way. But in other words, I think we need to create a new mythology around this. I don't
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:44.720]   think you pop into a laboratory. I don't think you pop into a retreat center from one day to
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.680]   the next. I think that in my own case, I feel like I've been preparing 12 years for psychedelics,
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.680]   and I'm still preparing, including in today's conversation. I'm learning new things,
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:24:02.000]   and I'm willing to explore it together with the computer interface. But I do think ritual
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.880]   is a gigantic part of this, and even McKenna would say that. I'll paraphrase him by saying that
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.960]   if you'd met someone who didn't know where they were between the years 1995 and 2005,
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.080]   you would describe them as a fairly damaged person. And yet, who among us knows what was
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:26.160]   happening in Western civilization between 900 and 1300, let alone 2,500 years ago? So, this is,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.120]   in many ways, the prophet of the psychedelic Renaissance saying that history has lessons.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.280]   And I don't think they're superficial lessons. I think it cuts to the very core of how and why
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.280]   Western civilization came to be born. - Yeah, but that history can be loaded
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:50.560]   into AI systems, and I do love the idea of whether it's to bring computer interfaces or without
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:57.360]   intrusive, sort of, without direct reading of the neurons and more sort of interactive
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.280]   experience with a robot, that you can have an AI system that steers your psychedelic experience,
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.200]   that helps you sort of, when you take a heroic dose of psilocybin, for example,
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.880]   helps steer you, steer your mind, say just the right things. I mean, you could say that kind
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:25.200]   of thing with, it's a totally open problem, I would say. You talk about set and setting.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:31.200]   This is the interesting thing about Johns Hopkins is, you know, you create a comfortable environment,
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.480]   a safe environment for allowing, then if you take a heroic, like a large dose of psilocybin,
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.520]   that you could trust that everything would be safe and you can really allow the exploration
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.320]   of your mind, but then you don't know from a psychotherapy perspective of like, during that trip,
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.440]   what a human should say to steer that trip. Like, that's a totally open set of problems.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.960]   And in some sense, probably throughout history, those rituals, you've figured out what are the
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.720]   right things to say to each other. - Exactly.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.200]   - How to collaborate. And maybe if you can turn that into an optimization problem,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   AI could figure that out much, much quicker. - I'm with you. So, elusus was known for three
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:18.880]   things, the legomena, the dromena, and the deignumena, the things said, the things done,
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.600]   the things shown. If you can pack that all into your AI interface, I'm in, Lex Friedman.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.920]   - I'm gonna write a proposal and then try to get it through the IRB at MIT.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:37.600]   I mean, there's a certain sense in which I definitely wanted to explore psychedelics,
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.600]   I mean, in my personal life, but also more rigorously as a scientist,
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:52.080]   and to push that forward. And especially in the AI space, and it is difficult how to do that dance
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:58.560]   when there's gray areas of legality and all those kinds of things. And we're dancing around them,
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:06.640]   and some of that is language, and some of that is what we socially conceive of as drugs or not. And
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.320]   you're right that perhaps we can reframe it as religious experiences, all those kinds of things.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.880]   I mean, it's fascinating because it feels like there's a bunch of tools before us that were
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:24.080]   used by the ancients that we're not utilizing for exploring the human mind, that we very well could
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:30.240]   be in a rigorous scientific way, in a safe way. And that's fascinating. There's this interesting
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:41.200]   period in the 20th century of LSD use that many of the people doing research on psychedelics now
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   kind of have their roots in that history. I mentioned that Dr. Rick Doblin, he is one of
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:54.000]   those people. And there's this interesting story of a bunch of creatives that used LSD or other
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.080]   drugs to help them. What do you make of the idea of somebody like Ken Kesey who wrote "One
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:08.960]   Flover's the Cuckoo's Nest" in part under the influence of LSD? Like, what do you make of the
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:21.600]   use of psychedelics to maximize the creative potential of the human mind? Is this a crutch
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:30.400]   or is this actually an effective tool that we should explore? - One person's crutch might be
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:40.960]   another's bungee cord. It depends on that mind. Think about Paul McCartney. I mean, we might not
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.520]   have some of the better Beatles music in the absence of LSD. And what did Sir Paul say in 1967
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.360]   when he was asked about his use of LSD? He said that he recognized the dangers inherent in it,
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.280]   but that he did it with a very specific, very deliberate purpose in mind. He wanted to find
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:05.440]   the answer to what life is all about. And I'm not sure what Sir Paul is doing this week, but he's
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:12.720]   probably not doing LSD. Speaking back to my theory about these substances being catalyzers of
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:19.280]   spiritual introspection, it came along at a time in their life when I think they were ripe for it,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:26.000]   especially George Harrison. I highly recommend the Martin Scorsese documentary about George
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.640]   Harrison. For them, I think it was exactly the way we ought to investigate it, which is,
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:39.040]   well, mind expanders. This is what psychedelics do, right? That which makes manifest the contents
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.560]   of the mind. In the absence of an experience like that, and it can be in a three-day fast,
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   it can be laying down in a cave, it can be in ritual chanting, it can be in a sun dance,
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.360]   but in the absence of that kind of experience at the right time in your life, it may otherwise be
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:00.720]   very difficult to find entrance to that kingdom of heaven, which I do think is here and now,
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.280]   getting right back to the very beginning. If we are actually to participate in that
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:11.440]   eternal principle, how and when? - What do you think Nietzsche meant when he said that God is
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:21.040]   dead? So there's a sense that religion is fading from society. And there's a cranky German that
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.920]   kind of wrote about it. What do you think he meant? - He was a cranky German who knew a lot
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:32.000]   about Dionysus, by the way, which is why I like him. So certainly there's some truth
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.360]   to the mortality of God. I think Gallup put out a study only a couple of months ago where church
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:45.760]   membership is now officially in the minority in the United States at 47%, according to the most
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:52.000]   recent poll. That number was closer to 70% only 20 years ago. So we're living through something,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.320]   and we're living through the unchurching of America, and it's the rise of the spiritual
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:03.040]   but not religious, the inheritor of all traditions but the slave to none. There's a rise in the
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.600]   unaffiliated, the nuns. I think it was like one-third of millennials, it's probably much
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:13.040]   higher now, that don't affiliate with any religion. So in that sense, God is absolutely dead,
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.360]   but maybe not the God that we were trying to define at the very beginning. So Nietzsche also
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:25.600]   looked forward to the Übermensch, which would be a fully realized human being that despite the death
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:34.000]   of God did not fall into nihilism and amorality, existential despair, all that great German stuff.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.160]   And there are some commentators who talk about this eternal recurrence that just maybe by
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.200]   incorporating some of these techniques, not necessarily doctrine and dogma, but I would say
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:51.520]   the techniques of antiquity. And again, Nietzsche writes a lot about the rationality of Dionysus
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.200]   having its place in society. If anything, these biochemical discoveries, I think, point us back.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:04.080]   They point us back to Dionysus and their responsible incorporation of the irrational
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.960]   into our otherwise society of rational people and our kazooistry.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:17.600]   I have a sense that there will be kind of, just kind of as you've implied, that there will be
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:24.160]   maybe the God of old is dying and there'll be a rebirth of different kind of God and it'll just
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.840]   keep happening throughout history. I do think there will be a time where AI will be the gods
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:36.480]   we'll look to, the other, the super intelligent, those kinds of things. There's a little bit of an
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:44.640]   inkling of religious longing for meaning in the way people conceive of aliens currently.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:51.600]   I mean, I talked to a bunch of people about UFOs, EOPs, and aliens. And so to me, it's very
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.640]   interesting for perhaps different reasons, because I'm just, I look up to the stars and
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:02.960]   it's incredibly humbling to me to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:09.600]   out there, which to me seems likely, or perhaps not intelligent, perhaps just alien life. And
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.800]   actually also that we don't even understand what it means to be intelligent or do we understand
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:23.520]   what it means to be alive. The time scale, the spatial scale, which patterns of atoms can form
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:31.920]   in a way that you can call life, it's just could be way weirder than we can imagine. And certainly
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:38.480]   way different than human life. Anyway, that to me is humbling. And so it's almost like the
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.400]   simulation, conceiving of the world of simulation, thinking of aliens to me is a useful thought
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.440]   experiment of like, what would aliens look like if they visited? How would we know? How would we
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:57.520]   communicate with them? How would we send signals to them if they're already here and we don't see
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:03.440]   them? How's that possible? That seems to me actually likely that we would just be too self-centered
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:11.440]   and too dumb to see them if they're already here. Anyway, so that's kind of the, almost the
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:18.160]   pragmatic, the engineering, the physics sense of aliens, but there's also kind of a longing
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.240]   to connect with other intelligent beings out there, both the fear and the excitement of that,
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.560]   that has kind of a religious aspect to it. And I find fascinating. And in the right context,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.840]   when you remove the skepticism of government from that, it's actually a hopeful longing.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:43.600]   Do you have a, do you see this kind of interest in aliens as at all connected to your study of
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.080]   religion? - So you're the first person to ask me about aliens in eight months. So it looks like
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.920]   I'm going on the record. - Let's go.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:35:00.640]   - I'll drop some J. Allen Hynek on you. So Hynek, involved in Project Blue Book, famously says in
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:07.280]   1966, when the long-awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, and we're assuming that UFOs have
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:13.280]   something to do with aliens, but when the long-awaited solution comes, I believe it will
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:19.520]   prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science, but a mighty and unexpected
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:26.560]   quantum leap. In other words, I do not think that we're dealing with flesh and blood beings
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.800]   in nuts and bolts crafts. I think it's way, way more complicated than that. And if anything,
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.080]   it takes me back to the ancient world. It takes me back to this invisible college of beings of
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   apparent higher intent. It takes me to the geniuses and the muses. So the first document
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:51.040]   in Western civilization, Homer's Epics, they begin by invoking an alien. They invoke a muse.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:02.000]   Tell me, oh muse, about the man. So Homer isn't inventing poetry, he's channeling poetry,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.240]   epic poetry from an alien intelligence. Maybe that intelligence has felt a little
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.480]   unrecognized in recent years. - Trying to show up in human
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.640]   recognizable forms, the muse is trying to give a little hint of its existence. Yeah, I mean,
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.000]   I have a, I've been saying, I honestly sort of, I don't believe this, but I think about this,
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.720]   whether alien, like muse is a great example, whether aliens could be thoughts.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:43.520]   Ideas we have are the aliens, or consciousness itself is the methods by which aliens communicate
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:51.360]   with us. I find this very kind of liberating to expand our conception of what intelligent
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.960]   beings are. - You would like Julian Jaynes.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.400]   Julian Jaynes writes a great book, The Origins of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:07.520]   Mind. It's this theory that the ancient Greek mind was very different from ours, and that when
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.240]   they heard the muses, or the gods and goddesses for that matter, they would hear them as voices
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:20.160]   in the head, and hear it as an internal god figure offering commands, which they couldn't ignore. So,
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:24.320]   were they walking schizophrenics? It might be one way to talk about it before the breakdown
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.920]   of the bicameral mind. But it's a provocative theory, largely untestable. But when you're
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.720]   reading ancient Greek, and Latin for that matter, you can't read it very long without bumping up
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.120]   against these discarded entities. They're everywhere, and they survived. They persist
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.680]   across time, which is even stranger. Not just in the form of all the things my daughters like,
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.360]   like fairies, and gnomes, and elves, but, and McKenna loves this, the sylphs, and the boulder
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.320]   grinders, and the sprites, and the djins, and elementals. Every society has them. It seems to
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:02.240]   be fairly universal. And they largely exist in folklore, mythology. This is what Jacques Vallée
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:07.120]   writes about so wonderfully. - We've kind of been sneaking around it,
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:13.040]   but let me ask you, from yours, from everything we've been talking about, how do you think about
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:21.760]   consciousness? Is it a fun little trick that the human mind does, or is it somehow fundamental to
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:26.640]   this whole thing? - So, this three-pound lump of jelly
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:34.960]   inside our craniums that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space, it can contemplate
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:41.120]   the meaning of infinity, and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity,
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.880]   that peculiar self-recursive quality that we call self-awareness. So, this is the hard problem,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:54.080]   right? This is the unknowable, the unknown, at least. I don't know. I have no good answer for
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.480]   that. Aside from that-- - Do you think it's somehow
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.720]   deeply fundamental to the human experience, or is it just a trick? So, you have like,
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:08.720]   I mean, Sam Harris has really been making me think about this. So, calling free will an illusion,
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:17.520]   the interesting thing about Sam is it's not just a philosophical little chatted with him about
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:26.800]   free will. He really says he experiences the lack of free will. Like, he's able to, you know,
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:35.040]   large parts of the day to feel like he has no free will. In that same way, now, he thinks that
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:43.760]   consciousness is not an illusion. It is, you know, it's a real thing, but at the same, I'm more,
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.040]   almost like, I'm almost more of like, consciousness seems to be a little bit of an illusion,
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.880]   in the sense that, like, it feels like maybe this is a robotics AI perspective, but it feels like,
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:02.240]   in that same way that Sam steps outside of feeling like he has an agency, feeling like he has a free
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:10.400]   will, I feel like we should be able to step outside of having a consciousness. So, that,
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.960]   from my perspective, maybe that's a hopeful perspective for trying to engineer consciousness,
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.960]   but do you think consciousness is like, at the core of this, or is it just like, language,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:30.000]   or almost like a thing we build on top of a much deeper human, the things that makes us human?
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.040]   I don't know. I am attracted to Lenz's notion of biocentrism. I mean, it's difficult to walk
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:41.280]   away from the double-slit experiment not wondering why we seem capable of collapsing
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:47.360]   that quantum wave function. It's very, very weird, giving rise to even weirder ideas about
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.400]   superposition and spooky action at a distance, and things that MIT guys know a lot better than me.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:59.600]   But it seems to me fundamental. Maybe consciousness is the fundamental thing. I mean, weirdly,
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.880]   some of these ancient incubatory practices--I talked about Peter Kingsley before. So, he's not
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.000]   a proponent of ancient psychedelic use, but is a proponent of these ancient rites of incubation
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.080]   that were practiced by Pythagoras, Parmenides, and Pedocles, other pre-Socratics. And so,
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.840]   what were they doing? They were trying to get in touch with consciousness. They were
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.680]   entering into suspended states of animation in these cave-like settings. Pythagoras had built
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.120]   one in his basement and would lie down motionless, apparently, for long periods of time. And what I
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.360]   think they were trying to do was tap into and try to answer this question in their own--you
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.400]   could call it a scientific way, actually, less religion than science. And what they would
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.520]   discover or try to discover was a state of awareness that is somehow beyond life and death,
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.480]   beyond waking and dreaming, where you can be aware of the senses but also in touch
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.960]   with another reality at the exact same time, what Kingsley calls sensation.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.600]   That, I think, is definitely worth exploring.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:09.680]   Well, and the way I hope to explore is by trying to build it. Everybody uses the tools they have.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.320]   Well, no, I do also hope psychedelics could help.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.240]   So how do you build that? I'm curious.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:20.560]   That's a whole other discussion. There's a lot of things I could say here, but let me put simply
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:33.920]   is I believe that you can go a long way towards building consciousness by trying to fake
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:41.360]   consciousness. So fake it till you make it, as an engineering approach, I think will work
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.160]   for consciousness.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.560]   You seem satisfied with that.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:53.040]   I'm satisfied with that because I know how deeply unsatisfied others are, but just wait.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:04.160]   I mean, I don't know what to--so the topic of consciousness is mostly handled by
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.160]   philosophers currently, and that's great.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.520]   And their philosophers are wonderful and good at what they do.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.560]   I'm not a philosopher. I'm an engineer.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.960]   And I think the approach there is quite different.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:30.480]   I think falling in love is different than trying to have a podcast conversation about what is love.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.600]   You know, I think the engineering effort is just fundamentally different than the philosophical
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.400]   effort.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:46.080]   And I have a sense that consciousness can be engineered even before it is understood by
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.120]   the philosophers.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.520]   So I think there's a bunch of things like that in this world that could be engineered before
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.640]   they're understood.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.440]   I think the intelligence is one such thing.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:01.680]   I think we'll be able to engineer super intelligent beings before we're able to understand
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:02.480]   the human mind.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.000]   That's--yeah.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:13.200]   I mean, there's less--there's a lot of intuition to unpack there of why that is, but as it
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.680]   stands, that's perhaps my engineering optimism and engineering ethic under which I operate.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.920]   Consciousness is easy to build, hard to understand.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.040]   Okay.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:34.240]   Are there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.680]   You've--Immortality Key is exceptionally well researched.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:45.120]   The amount of books you read is--I cannot even imagine.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:53.200]   So is there something in those--in your travels through the land of language that stuck with
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.040]   you that was especially impactful?
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:01.520]   I mentioned a couple of them, but--so I knew nothing about psychedelics before 2007.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.720]   And it was in hearing about some of the first psilocybin experiments at Hopkins.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.480]   And then shortly thereafter, I went down this rabbit hole.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.560]   And so, the first set of recommendations all kind of fit in that time period in my life,
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.960]   2007, 2008.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:22.400]   It started with Jeremy Narby, The Cosmic Serpent, DNA and the Origins of Knowledge.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:27.680]   It was a total impulse buy at the Barnes and Noble on 6th Avenue in New York,
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.720]   and wound up introducing me to Supernatural by Graham Hancock.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:42.320]   That convinced me that there was a long story to psychedelics that he tried to prove in that book,
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.520]   and that we're still trying to prove.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.480]   I mentioned the connection between ritual psychedelics and cave art.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.400]   This is the neuropsychological model that was first proposed by David Lewis Williams
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.720]   at the University of Waterstrand, the same university where Lee Berger is, by the way,
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.520]   in South Africa.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.640]   So these ideas are old.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.680]   But what Graham did in that book is just--it's well worth your time.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:07.200]   It's well worth a few reads, actually.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.400]   Because it was after that that I discovered Breaking Open the Head by Daniel Pinchbeck,
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.320]   and a lot of other books that just kind of blew my mind.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.840]   What is Breaking Open the Head about?
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.480]   So it's Daniel's romp through contemporary shamanism.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:32.160]   And it's his very well-told experiences with everything from psilocybin to iboga
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.920]   being initiated by the Bwitis.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.880]   And it was the first time I'd read any firsthand accounts,
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.560]   aside from Jeremy Narby, any firsthand accounts by a New Yorker, by the way,
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.280]   about the potential for these compounds that I'd been ignoring for far too long, obviously.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.280]   And so, that's when I started revisiting The Road to Eleusis and looking through the
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.440]   anthropological literature, reading everything Gordon Wasson had ever written, that Karl Ruck
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:46:59.920]   had written.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:04.480]   And it sent me down a pretty weird rabbit hole until I found Peter Kingsley,
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.960]   which is my second recommendation.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.520]   So Peter, again, he's not a fan of the psychedelic hypothesis.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:18.000]   But what he does is I think expose the value of the irrational to the ancient Greeks,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.200]   especially the pre-Socratics.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:26.000]   Here we are talking about AI and God and these entangled philosophical questions.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:32.960]   The best I can read Kingsley is that Western civilization is a product of a gift from the
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.920]   goddess Persephone.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:41.280]   And this is not a hippie, this is a pretty gold standard classicist who went on to write
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.560]   a couple of books.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.840]   One is In the Dark Places of Wisdom, and the other is Reality, what better way to title
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.440]   your book, where he talks about these ancient techniques for exploring the irrational.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.040]   The same thing Karl Ruck was talking about.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.800]   After compiling all this data in The Road to Eleusis, Ruck says that the biggest challenge
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.840]   is trying to convince his colleagues in the late 1970s that the ancient Greeks and indeed,
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:12.480]   some of the most famous and intelligent among them could enter so fully into irrationality.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.160]   Same thing Nietzsche is talking about in his exploration of Dionysus.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.640]   And so I think Kingsley just stands apart as one of those books, Reality, that my life
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.880]   was never quite the same after reading that.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:38.720]   - We talked about the three pound jelly that is able to conceive of the entirety of the
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.480]   fabric of reality in the universe and everything, and also of its own mortality.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.280]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.000]   What's the meaning of life?
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.280]   - (laughs)
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.160]   - Is the three pound jelly able to answer that one?
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.120]   - (laughs) No, but I can plagiarize Joseph Campbell, which is good enough.
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.800]   Joe Campbell says that, "I don't think what we're looking for is a meaning of life.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:15.840]   I think what we're looking for is an experience of being alive, so that the experiences we have
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.600]   on the purely physical plane will have resonances within that are those of our innermost being
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.400]   and reality."
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.640]   You talked about the true reality, absolute truth.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:32.000]   These are all constructs, and I think they're constructs that are made day by day and acquire
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.760]   this aura of factuality.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.960]   Remember in Clifford Geertz's definition of religion, we're all just faking it until we
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.680]   make it.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.400]   And I think a lot of that has to do with moods and motivations and feelings and emotions,
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.040]   which is not to discredit facts and figures.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:55.040]   But I think that meaning, meaning making, is a very subjective process that is not only
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.200]   difficult to talk about, but difficult to quantify.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.840]   - And experience is a primary in that versus...
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:07.520]   So like the actual subjective experience is primary to the meaning making process versus
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:15.200]   like some kind of rigorous analysis of like having an algorithm that runs and computes
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.840]   and then finally spits out 42.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.280]   - Well, this is how families are created.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.880]   - Tell me more about this.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.040]   - Well, my wife and I fell in love and made babies.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.120]   We didn't type up an Excel sheet and figure out the best way to go about this.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.200]   - That's what I've been doing all these years.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.800]   That's why I'm single.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.440]   - Too many Excel sheets.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.240]   Well, we say falling in love, right?
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.360]   We say fall in love.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.280]   What does that mean to fall in love?
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:49.440]   You are surrendering to an intelligence that is beyond us.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.200]   You could say a God-like intelligence.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.000]   Richard Rohr, the Franciscan friar I mentioned in the Universal Christ, he writes a lot about
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.600]   how the divine for you is often encountered in the other.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.120]   In fact, how could it be otherwise?
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:08.960]   This is bedrock sacramental theology that you find the God in the things in your life
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:10.080]   as well you should.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:16.160]   That's the proving ground for identifying as God rather than creating a relationship
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:16.720]   with God.
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.920]   So I think that these irrational states play a big role in that.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.440]   - Irrational.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:24.960]   Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it than on the topic of love.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:31.600]   Brian, thank you so much for a brilliant exposition of history and the poetry.
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.880]   I really appreciate you talking with me today.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.760]   - I love you, Lex.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.520]   - I love you too, Brian.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:43.520]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Muir-Escu and thank you to Inside
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:48.480]   Tracker, GiveWell, NI, Indeed, and Masterclass.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.120]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:56.480]   And now let me leave you with some words from Terrence McKenna about psychedelics.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:02.320]   Part of what psychedelics do is they decondition you from cultural values.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.840]   This is what makes it such a political hot potato.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:11.280]   Since all culture is a kind of con game, the most dangerous candy you can hand out is one
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.800]   which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.880]   Thank you for listening.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.480]   I hope to see you next time.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.040]   [END]
