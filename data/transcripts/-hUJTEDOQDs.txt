[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   (bright music)
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.800]   This year at AI Ascent,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.840]   we are doing a few things differently.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.280]   One of those things is the what's next section
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   that we talked about, these visionary ideas.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.540]   Another is the what's now that Sonia has been talking about,
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.920]   about how are people taking things in AI
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.760]   and implementing them.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.960]   As part of this, we don't just have
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.680]   the amazing foundation model CEOs like Sam,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.800]   and Arthur, and Daniela.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280]   We've also brought in two exceptional leaders
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440]   in the space of taking AI
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000]   and making it enterprise-ready at scale.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800]   One of those is CJ.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.240]   CJ has been the president and COO of ServiceNow
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.420]   for the past seven years.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340]   And in addition to ServiceNow being a Sequoia-backed company
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.080]   for over a decade,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.840]   ServiceNow is in an exceptional business.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.360]   It's the kind of business anyone in this room
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.820]   should aspire to be like.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.840]   Pat, I believe sourced the business in 2012.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.680]   Is that right?
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.000]   2009.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.460]   And what was the scale of the business then, Pat?
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.500]   20 what?
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.160]   Million of ARR.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.280]   Okay.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.980]   Anyone have a guess as to where ServiceNow is now
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.820]   in terms of ARR?
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.880]   Andy, I feel like you know this.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.100]   Billion?
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.220]   One more guess.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   20 billion?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.940]   Okay.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.880]   Somewhere in that range is correct.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.360]   So ServiceNow is the third largest
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.760]   software-as-a-service company in the world.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.180]   It has a market cap of $155 billion.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340]   It is about to cross 10 billion of ARR.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.360]   It's at 9.75 billion of ARR.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.000]   Remarkably, when you took over as president and COO
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.880]   seven years ago, it was at a billion of ARR.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.800]   So it's 10x growth.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.480]   And it was 13 billion of market cap.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.020]   So it's been a 12 plus X multiple from there.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.480]   It's adding 600 million of ARR a quarter.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.160]   So let that be something to aspire to.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.200]   And I mentioned it's the third largest
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.860]   SaaS company in the world.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, number one is growing at 11% a year.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.360]   Number two is growing at 12% a year.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.900]   And ServiceNow is growing at 26% a year.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.480]   So we all are good at math that ranking
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   doesn't last very long with that kind of growth.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   And CJ told me virtually all of this has been organic.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.520]   They've made some acquisitions like Element AI.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.240]   They've been very ahead of the curve on AI.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.520]   But really it's been organic.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400]   It's called ServiceNow,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   but it does not have services margins.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   This is an 82% gross margin business.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.680]   The free cash flow is 30%.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   Operating income, 27%.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   This is a rule of 56 business on the rule of 40 terms.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.480]   And since IPO, since Pat sourced it in '07,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   I don't know what kind of multiple it's had.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.480]   What was the valuation then, Pat?
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.100]   What it would be invested?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.840]   260 million posts.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   That's pretty good from 260 million posts
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.200]   to 155 billion, nicely done.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.560]   Since IPO, it's been up 42 times, 42X returns.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.840]   So an exceptional story,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   and one that I think is both grounding
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.980]   and also aspirational for everyone in this room.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.200]   One of the main reasons why we were so excited
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.520]   to have you come, CJ,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.680]   is ServiceNow has been way ahead of the curve on AI.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440]   We first met actually in a conversation
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.720]   where you were talking about the AI vision with NVIDIA,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.840]   with Jensen and the NVIDIA team.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280]   And we might have a clip actually,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.640]   but just yesterday at the NVIDIA conference,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.040]   ServiceNow was a main feature.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.240]   The specific use cases on the NVIDIA platform.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.440]   And at the previous conference, it comes up as a main user.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   My first question for you, CJ,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.240]   is please tell us how you got here
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   to this exceptional role as COO
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.760]   where you do much of the product work.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.440]   And then please tell us how you've gotten
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.580]   the AI suite, what it is today,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.360]   and how you've gotten the AI suite to where it is.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.120]   Yeah, so first of all, thank you for inviting me.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   And he asked me a fun fact.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And the fun fact is that I'm a failed standup comedian.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   So I'm constantly working on the material
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   to try something out,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   very high self-deprecating humor
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   that you will see from time to time.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.440]   And at the highest level,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.840]   I want to say that we are extremely,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.360]   extremely grateful to Sequoia.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   And here is a simple story.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   The story is that before we were going public in 2012
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   is when we went public with a modest market cap
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.920]   of $3.9 billion.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   Okay, that's when we went public in 2012.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.400]   And it was a meh IPO.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.440]   People were like, you know, Facebook was pretty good.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.700]   Back then it was called Facebook, the same year.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.920]   And Workday was another one.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.440]   And we were a meh IPO.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.840]   But before that,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   VMware made an offer to ServiceNow
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.760]   for single-digit billions,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.440]   single-digit billions, below five.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.120]   And Doug Leone and the Sequoia team
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.400]   convinced the management team,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.320]   which would have been happy to take that offer
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.880]   because they're like, wow, we don't have to go public.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.840]   We can be part of a great company like VMware at the time.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.780]   And Doug Leone, to his credit,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.560]   convinced not only the board,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.780]   but also the management team that you can become big.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.460]   So we are extremely grateful for Sequoia's coaching
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.380]   at that point in time.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.220]   And for the $2 billion offer which we could have taken
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   versus today's $155 billion in just a matter of 12 years,
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.920]   it's incredible.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.640]   So thank you to Sequoia and the team
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.260]   for sourcing us and believing in us
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.280]   and allowing us to get here
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.960]   because it would have been a very easy thing
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.000]   for Doug to say he was on the board
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.360]   and the return would have been amazing
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.680]   for Sequoia at that point in time
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   and we still walked away.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.920]   - CJ texted me before and he said,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.760]   "Excited to see you.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.080]   "Can't wait to be part of the cult that is Sequoia."
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.040]   You're already in it now.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.500]   - I am, I am, I am.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   But I just wanted to be thankful and grateful
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.380]   and you guys work with great people at Sequoia
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.500]   and I never take that lightly
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.540]   and on the path to our growth,
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.700]   we never forget our friends and supporters.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.260]   So just wanted to start there, okay?
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.140]   Number two, on the scale,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.580]   so I joined the company,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.340]   so Frank Slootman hired me
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.260]   and Frank Slootman was also placed by Sequoia
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.660]   at ServiceNow.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.020]   And Frank had two choices at the time,
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.860]   which is I think public knowledge,
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.020]   but Frank's data domain gets acquired
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.780]   and then he decided,
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.860]   and I make fun of Jess all the time on this topic,
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.340]   but he decides that he's gonna be a VC
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.460]   and he joined Greylock.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.780]   And if you have met Frank Slootman,
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.940]   which I'm sure some of you have,
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.780]   he is not a Sand Hill guy.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.780]   So he said, "No, I need to go back to operational CEO job."
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.260]   And it was Sequoia that convinced him.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.900]   Frank had two offers, Palo Alto Network CEO
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.860]   or ServiceNow CEO and he picked ServiceNow.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.060]   Okay, at that point in time.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.340]   And that was also Sequoia was behind it.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.220]   So when Frank hired me,
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.540]   we were doing billion plus in ARR
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.940]   and Frank said, "CJ, by 2020,
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.600]   "if we can get to four billion of ARR,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.940]   "that'll be a massive W and let's go for it."
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.500]   And our founder who created the company
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.880]   close to at age of 50, Fred Luddy, who became bankrupt.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.300]   So this is not a classic Stanford, Harvard story,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.880]   but it's like he went to Indiana University
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.620]   and it's originally from Indiana.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.300]   And he said, "I'm gonna create a platform
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.740]   "that can solve multiple use cases."
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.740]   And so we always knew that TAM was pretty much unlimited
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.380]   and the platform provided everything you need
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.840]   to create a product or multiple products.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.420]   And so when I joined, we were one-ish billion.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.100]   We had one large product and two or three small products.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.780]   And since then, it has been brutal execution
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.020]   on which buyers we go out of.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.500]   Like the simple question on when my product team comes
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.740]   and says, "Hey, we can create this great product."
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.060]   My first question is, "Who is the buyer?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.720]   "Do we have access to that buyer?
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.100]   "Is that buyer next door or two doors down
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.460]   "or five doors down?
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.180]   "And will current buyer introduce us to that buyer
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.340]   "or those two buyers don't talk to each other?"
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.700]   Those kind of simple questions on who is the buyer,
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.260]   who are we competing against, okay?
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.400]   And even though this is very simple,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.140]   the third one, what is the size of the price?
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.240]   That if we nail this use case,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.560]   can we create a billion-dollar ARR product?
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.800]   Again, another product.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   So we have been doing that level of precise execution,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.340]   and that's what has helped us on organic innovation.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.640]   We haven't bought revenue.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.040]   We are the only SaaS company that has not bought revenue
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.260]   on our path to 10.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:54.280]   And we always buy amazing companies,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.720]   which has great people,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.940]   and then we make them work on our platform.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.320]   But that's how we have scaled now from 2016 billion-plus
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   to 2023 when we exited the December quarter.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   We already reached 10 billion of ACV.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.760]   And then, of course, the revenue trails a little bit,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.200]   and we guided for 10.75 billion growing at 21%.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.400]   I mean, these are some of the numbers,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.720]   but it has been,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.160]   hey, you have an underlying platform that's cloud-based.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.360]   What products do you create?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.800]   What are you solving for?
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.460]   Who is the buyer?
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.960]   That brutal focus on who is the buyer.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   Do we have access to the buyer?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   And what is the size of the price?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.320]   And without that, with my product team and engineering team,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.420]   and I joined as a head of products and engineering.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.960]   Frank hired me and left after that,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.440]   but that's been the focus.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.760]   And on AI, it's as simple as we had a fundamental belief
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.720]   from supervised machine learning and as AI evolved
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.600]   all the way to Gen AI today.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   We have been very focused on AI in service of our use cases,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.160]   because if we can infuse AI in our use cases,
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.480]   it's a very easy conversation with a JPMorgan Chase
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.640]   or a Citibank or United States Army,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.440]   that, hey, you are using service now for this use case,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.840]   AI will help accelerate X or accelerate Y.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   And so we have been acquiring or gaining small teams
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.700]   that are AI experts at various stages all the way from 2016.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.040]   2017 was our first one.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.200]   2016, we started the journey.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.060]   And then when we bought Element AI,
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.080]   they were trying to be the next Google of Canada.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.120]   And they had somewhere between 170 to 180 engineers
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   between PhDs, data scientists, and engineers.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.840]   And they were in this amazing team,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.900]   a lot of very well-known people.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.300]   Yoshua Bengio, who won the Turing Award,
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.780]   was part of that team.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.020]   There are people who have written some seminal paper
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.300]   on transformer model.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.940]   That's the kind of team we got.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.340]   And the call I got from Allen & Company was,
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.960]   hey, this is a great team.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.180]   They have no revenue, zero.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.780]   And they are trying to figure out
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.280]   what use case AI can be applied to.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.760]   And this was during pandemic.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.340]   And I went to my boss, our CEO, and I said,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.780]   hey, man, these people don't have any revenue,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.540]   but it's a great talent.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.260]   And we need to spend some money.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.700]   And to Bill's credit, he said, absolutely.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.060]   If you believe this is a great talent, let's take them.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.060]   And they showed me Chad GPT 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 demos
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:47.140]   in 2020, late and early 2021.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.100]   And then when this whole thing just blew up in 2022,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.260]   we exactly knew where we could apply LLMs to our use cases.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.820]   And again, I don't know if it's a term, but SLMs.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.200]   We are very use case specific LLMs
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.860]   that we apply in service now.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.380]   And we started our monetization strategy in September.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.540]   So that's the story.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.820]   I know it was a simple question,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.300]   but I had to give a pretty long answer
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.740]   because there's a lot of history to it.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.940]   - Really incredible.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.940]   And I didn't realize, frankly, until this conversation
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.140]   that you guys are the only SaaS business ever
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.920]   to cross the 10 billion ARR point fully organically.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.320]   That's remarkable.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.180]   And frankly, I've talked to a bunch of people in service now.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.580]   You are so much of the product brain.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.980]   It's such a pleasure to get to learn from you.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.680]   And this question is on product.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.940]   So you guys had a little bit of a headstart a few years,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.700]   'cause I know you and Bill had been talking about AI
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.140]   even ahead of the element acquisition.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.820]   But then with the element acquisition,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.660]   you got to think about
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.140]   how you're gonna integrate it into your product.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.360]   Tell us about how you got up the curve
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.980]   and now how AI is in service now products,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.940]   maybe a couple of examples.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.920]   - Yeah, so I'll just take the recent example.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.300]   We are a big fan of open source community
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.860]   when it comes to AI.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.180]   Even on the NLU models, we worked with Stanford
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.060]   to figure out which libraries we can use,
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.460]   which was four or five years ago.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.180]   But we are a big fan of open source community.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.180]   And the team in Canada, working with Hugging Face,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.300]   figured out for which use cases of service now
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.620]   you can apply AI.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.240]   So then we said, okay, now listen,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.760]   you talked about our gross margins.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.960]   Our gross margins are 82%.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.620]   And all of you run the companies,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.020]   your profitability starts at your gross margin level.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.060]   That's your first step or staircase.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.180]   82, then you add R&D cost, sales and marketing cost,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.860]   G&A cost, and then you get to profitability.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.860]   So we are world-class in terms of our gross margin at scale.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.380]   So I don't have the luxury.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.300]   It's a constraint-driven optimization problem
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.720]   that I don't have the luxury to say,
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.740]   I'm gonna run open AI everywhere in my farm, in our cloud,
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.460]   because we are 100% cloud company with 170 billion,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.780]   who knows, 2 trillion parameters now, with 4.0.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.220]   I don't have that luxury.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.220]   So the constraint was, can I run smaller models faster
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.980]   with lower latency for service now use cases?
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.520]   And that was a constraint-driven innovation.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.040]   And we partnered with Hugging Face,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.900]   our science and research team,
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.420]   and we came up with the first model on text-to-code.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.060]   And we are not trying to do text-to-code
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.580]   like GitHub Copilot with Java or anything.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.940]   Our text-to-code was specifically service now code,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.800]   how you configure service now.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.220]   And that was our first breakthrough
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.820]   working with Hugging Face.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.620]   And then, once we do that,
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.200]   and you talked about Jensen,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.460]   he's a big fan of Canada.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.500]   So when we acquired Element AI--
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.780]   - Me too, Canada.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.620]   - Yes.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.180]   So when we acquired Element AI,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.420]   it was the first phone call he made,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.180]   and said, "CJ, love the Canadian talent.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.660]   "We should do more together."
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.540]   And that was in 2020,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.500]   because his history with you, Toronto,
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.240]   and ImageNet, and all of those things.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.540]   So what we did is,
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.180]   that Canada team working with Hugging Face,
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.420]   we figured out smaller models,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.380]   a one-tenth the size of OpenAI.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.880]   And I told Jensen, "Hey, man, dude,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.400]   "you are constantly pushing the next rev, H-class,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.640]   "plus plus, I need these to run on A-100s."
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.120]   And that's what we'll work for,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.360]   because we are a public company.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.960]   So you have 1% gross margin, de-sell,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.560]   and the number of questions I get from investors,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.760]   like you get from VCs all the time, are not fun.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.600]   So, yes.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   So we basically said,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.880]   "I want smaller model that can run on A-100s,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.600]   "and I can replicate that in every cloud."
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.080]   He's still always trying to push me.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.160]   He's a great salesman, even though he acts like he isn't.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.120]   He's always trying to push for H,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.560]   to say H is faster, more efficient, which he's right.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.600]   But we wanted something to run on A.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.280]   So the smaller model,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.640]   smaller models is where we are going with use cases.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.560]   - Well, I hear you're really gonna need Blackwell.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.400]   - Yes, I know.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.080]   - The highest margin model.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.240]   - $30,000, or something?
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.200]   - Exactly.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.040]   What's that to you?
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.920]   - Fabulous.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.120]   I have one more question for CJ,
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.760]   and I'm giving you that heads up
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   so that you come up with a couple questions top of mind.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.880]   CJ, we've got a room of builders here,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.600]   and they're building many consumer companies,
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.480]   but also many enterprise companies.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.600]   Frankly, you're a dream customer
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.080]   for a lot of the companies in this room.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.000]   What can you tell people building products in this room
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.720]   to help guide them towards being a great AI builder
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.320]   that ServiceNow might consider partnering with
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.560]   and being a customer of?
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.520]   - Yeah, so I said there are two places.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.240]   So just, when you look at me, look at my forehead,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.880]   and it's a $1 billion spend I have in my cloud and software.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.840]   So if you wanna sell something to me,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.240]   make it quick, and I'll buy, okay?
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.960]   But I spend $1 billion, no jokes,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.160]   on cloud and software and on the infrastructure a year,
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.920]   and growing at 25% in line with our revenue.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.520]   So that's how much I spend,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.480]   so I can be a great customer of yours,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.780]   or at least a prospect.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.740]   In terms of what works is,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.100]   if you understand ServiceNow,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.740]   which if you go to our website,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.300]   you will not understand what ServiceNow does,
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.980]   but if you understand ServiceNow,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.780]   we do basically a lot of workflows,
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.780]   as in tasks that get orchestrated digitally
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.260]   in a certain sequence between human and machines.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.940]   That's what we do, right?
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.940]   Because people at a large bank or customers tell me
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.700]   that they can get a Tesla faster
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.980]   than getting a PC from the bank or a Mac from the bank
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.340]   when they order something, right?
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.220]   I mean, that's the reality of large corporations,
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.020]   large governments, and so on.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.900]   So when you request a PC at a bank, say,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.180]   and banks try to be very efficient,
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.980]   the processes that it goes through,
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.780]   does it require two levels of approval?
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.860]   Some banks have, for Mac, four levels of approval.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.340]   Then once those approvals are done,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.740]   it needs to go to shipping department.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.820]   Do they have inventory?
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.420]   They need to base image it,
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.460]   they need to put security creds on it,
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.700]   and then it goes to, okay,
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.620]   what is going to her home address,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.460]   or it's going to, these are the workflows,
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.540]   and these are the things that we automate behind the scene.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.340]   So all you say is, I want to pick this PC,
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.860]   I want to pick this monitor,
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.140]   I want it to be delivered via FedEx tomorrow morning.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.460]   That's the idea, right?
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.220]   But because of these complex workflows,
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.540]   and the banks want to harden the image of the Mac
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.260]   that they give you, if you're doing on a trading floor,
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.100]   that's what it takes.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.380]   So that's what ServiceNow does,
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.300]   and then we infuse AI in making it simpler and faster.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.020]   So for us, if you understand ServiceNow,
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.980]   and you can say, hey, CJ, for your use cases,
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.520]   here is the great technology that we have built,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.500]   and you can consume this technology,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.020]   whether it's your LLMs,
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.380]   or whether it's a use case specific AI that you have done,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.580]   or some kind of analytic, whatever it is,
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.780]   then you have my attention.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.040]   That if I can make the use cases for our customers better,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.380]   I have your attention, and I'll buy your product,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.620]   to make us go faster,
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.140]   so we can deliver for our customers, right?
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.500]   We have only 8,000 customers, only 8,000,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.820]   and if you think about 8,000 customers,
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.580]   10 billion ARR, you can do the math pretty fast,
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.540]   but we have only 8,000 customers,
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.420]   and so I'm obsessed, like OCD level obsessed,
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.380]   that if you come in and say,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.120]   here is what it can do for your use cases,
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.780]   I will listen to your pitch every day, okay?
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.820]   So that's one, and I have enough money to spend,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.540]   if we can serve our customers better.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.100]   And number two is, we have a great go-to-market team,
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.020]   so besides our engineering, AI, science, research team,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.960]   we have a great go-to-market team,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   and if you have something coming back to the buyer,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.460]   next door down person, or two doors down person,
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.740]   and you want to leverage, CIO is our prime buyer.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.660]   If you think about CIOs, 10, 15, 20 years ago,
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.660]   till ServiceNow came, CIOs were serving other C-suite.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.000]   Hey, for sales, I need to put Salesforce in,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.940]   for marketing, I may need to put Adobe in,
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.500]   for finance, SAP, I need to put for the CFO.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.020]   We were the first platform,
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.540]   we said this is the CIO's platform.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.720]   So if you say that CIO is your buyer,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.900]   and you want access to the CIO,
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.540]   there is no better company to partner with
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.020]   than ServiceNow, right?
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.120]   The two companies that really sell to CIO well
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.980]   is ServiceNow and Microsoft.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.420]   These are the two companies that sell really well.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.260]   - Brilliant.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.020]   I'm sure quite a few people in this room
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.260]   are interested in that $1 billion of cloud spend.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.900]   All right, we've got time for,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.060]   I'd say, let's say three to four questions.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.540]   Michelle, hello.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.180]   - Thanks, Vijay.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.700]   Many of us have dreams of an Act Two.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.420]   Some of us might already be thinking about Act Two
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.940]   in terms of a product,
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.060]   any advice in the early days of how you think
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.460]   about resourcing and philosophy around experimentation
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.820]   versus intentional bets around Act Two's product development?
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.660]   - Correct.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.980]   So I will share a story that the reason
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.820]   our IPO was very mid is because
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:13.100]   people said that our TAM was only 1.8 billion.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.300]   So one of the industry analysts said,
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.660]   "These guys are not gonna do well,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.780]   "and their TAM is limited."
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.220]   Same thing happened to many, many companies
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.140]   where people say, "I don't know if the TAM is there."
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   So for us, that actually created a chip on our shoulder
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.340]   because we believed that the TAM for ServiceNow
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.180]   was a lot bigger than what the industry analyst community
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.820]   said it was, which was sub-2 billion, okay?
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.460]   And this was in 2012, not too long ago.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.780]   So one thing is on your core, core being core,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.780]   you really, really have to understand what is the TAM,
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.580]   which is an art combined with science,
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.000]   before you start saying, "I wanna go multi-product.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.820]   "I wanna go now to different buyers
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.740]   "or the same buyer, but multi-products,"
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.940]   whatever the strategy you wanna go after
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.220]   with the buyer access, but the core has to be core.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.540]   The reason you exist is for something.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.460]   You try to solve a problem.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.540]   So really understand the TAM behind that core
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.580]   and then figure out, before you go into the next act,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.780]   why are you really going after that next act?
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.780]   So we prevented going after the next act
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.940]   till we hit one billion in ARR.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.740]   And then overnight, we flipped it,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.220]   and we said, "We are gonna go after these three
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.960]   "buying centers, security, HR, and customer service,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.640]   "in addition to IT, and here is the go-to market for it,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.140]   "here is the buyer for it,
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.500]   "and we are gonna rely on CIO
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.220]   "to make introduction to those buyers,"
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.120]   because we nailed the CIO.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.220]   So core has to be core,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.260]   and you really have to understand the TAM
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.500]   before you say, "I'm now taking,"
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.640]   because it's so easy to say,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.020]   "Oh, typical thing I hear from entrepreneurs,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.160]   "CEOs, smart people like yourself,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.220]   "hey, we have a great product,
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.360]   "but I don't have a great sales team."
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.360]   And then they flip constantly chief revenue officer, right?
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.480]   They do, some of you probably do.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.080]   And I always, when I'm asked for advice,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.000]   which rarely happens, but when I'm asked for advice,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.680]   I say, "What problem are you really trying to solve?
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.460]   "Is it the chief revenue officer,
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.060]   "or you really don't know what product you are building?"
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.880]   So that focus, that maniacal focus
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.720]   on main thing being the main thing,
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.640]   and what is the TAM really in there,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.360]   before you pivot, or before you go to second act,
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.840]   is something that we look out for.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.720]   So that's what we learned.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.800]   We said main thing should be the main thing
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.400]   till it hits billion,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.680]   before we go to the three other things.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.840]   - Any Sequoia company can discuss
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.200]   act two after a billion of ARR, is what I'm hearing.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.640]   And I think a very powerful insight there, CJ,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.560]   when we get the next question set up,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.960]   is just the power of the CIO.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.800]   I think a lot of people overlook that,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.600]   that HR and security would look to them.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.640]   Charlie.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.200]   - I have a question, which is just,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.000]   ServiceNow is a broad platform with many capabilities.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.360]   You have other ways you interface with customers,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.720]   like customer support.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.800]   How do you think about prioritizing
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.620]   where you want to integrate AI?
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.520]   - So, it has been hard in figuring out
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.320]   where AI could truly disrupt a use case, right?
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   Because that's always the hardest thing,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.200]   because it's still very bleeding edge.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.600]   And on the buyer side, if you're talking to a large bank,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.280]   if you're talking to a large government, right?
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.760]   And I'll share one story on this.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   So US public sector, which is federal, state and local, okay?
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.440]   You have to invest a lot in US public sector
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.760]   for certification of your product.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.240]   The cloud, you know, Microsoft has regions
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.400]   for IL-5, IL-6.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.200]   So our chief revenue officer came to me and said,
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.440]   "We want to go all in on US public sector."
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.520]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   And we had to invest 100 million plus in infra
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.220]   before we can start really making money
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.880]   in US public sector.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.760]   And now, whether it's US Army, US Navy, Air Force,
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.600]   to all public sector institution, even on civilian side,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.560]   are all ServiceNow wall-to-wall customers.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.400]   And coming back to the question,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   we always try to figure out the pain point
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.880]   and can AI really disrupt that use case
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.520]   in a positive way that customers gets higher value
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.960]   from ServiceNow.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.040]   So if I infuse AI in a use case,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.600]   because not all use cases are created equal, right?
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.960]   You have a product for multiple use cases.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.160]   Not all use cases are created equal,
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.080]   but which use case will really provide higher value?
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.680]   Because when customers spend money on you,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.160]   all they are looking for is how much value
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.040]   I'm gonna get out of this investment.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.800]   And that software ROIC, including AI ROIC, is hard.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.560]   Like right now, we are trying to tell everybody that,
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.180]   okay, we have gen AI infused in ServiceNow products.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.200]   Number one question is, how much will it cost?
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.760]   And what's the return I'm gonna get?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.200]   And if you're not doing outcome-based selling,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   so if you're not doing outcome-based selling,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.240]   it's like you are another guy coming in there
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.120]   and giving the AI pitch to the customer.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.260]   And truth is, nobody gives a shit.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.140]   I mean, they don't.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.320]   Because you have to be very, very clear and specific
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.140]   on here is where you will get the ROIC on that.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.140]   So wherever the highest ROIC is, that's where we prioritize.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.100]   That customers can say, okay, I could see,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.280]   if CJ is saying $10 million productivity
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.200]   for this large bank, most likely,
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.160]   because if CJ is gonna be $3 million,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.440]   but $3 million is still better than zero.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   Yeah?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.800]   - Andy.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.120]   - You have such a close understanding of what the CIO wants.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   - Yeah.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.940]   - Beyond HR support services, security, IT,
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.560]   what's the next set of use cases
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.480]   that the CIO is super excited about
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.200]   beyond what ServiceNow is currently harvesting?
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.040]   - Yeah, I would say, if you think,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.120]   and one thing you all should know,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.520]   this is what I learned, is in my seven years
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   at ServiceNow, they constantly told me
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   about CIO being chief irrelevant officer, okay?
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.040]   And they said, all the power is with developers.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.200]   And CJ, you are selling to the wrong door.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.240]   You need to be like other people and sell to developers.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.960]   Yes, developers will buy X, Y, Z, all that is fine.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   But the irrelevancy of CIO has been exaggerated.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.160]   And right now, CIO is the most technical person
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.920]   on a C-suite at most of the large companies
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.240]   which are your buyers, right?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.640]   You may have a CTO, the product person, right?
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.320]   The product tech person, and you have the CIO.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.840]   But product tech person is focused on innovation,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.040]   not about what they will buy from you.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.120]   So coming back to CIO's irrelevance,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.040]   has been exaggerated and over-exaggerated year after year.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.880]   And now, we mainly sell to Fortune 500.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.120]   In Fortune 500, the CEOs are only asking CIOs,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.080]   give us the AI roadmap, give us this,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.040]   give us that, and so on.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.000]   So that's number one, that CIO is still very relevant
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.360]   and very important, okay?
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.120]   It's not that developers are not,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.160]   but if you're selling to developers,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.200]   I mean, I was one, very fickle people, right?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.920]   They churn and sell thing, and someday they like this,
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.560]   and I read this on frickin' Reddit, and now I like this.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.000]   That's a hard thing to sell.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   So CIOs right now, with the state of economy today,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.540]   are focused on two main things.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.200]   One, where can I take out the cost,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.360]   just enterprise-wide using technology?
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.240]   So where can I take out the cost?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   And second, how can I help in the path to revenue?
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.360]   If I can help on the path to revenue,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.840]   whether it's quote to cash,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.320]   or whether it's any part of the sales,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.000]   front end or front office, CIO is constant.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.320]   Like today, I'll tell you at ServiceNow,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.160]   it still takes us a time when we propose
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.440]   a bill of material to a customer,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.120]   and customer says, well, I want to change quantity here,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.800]   quantity there, then we have to re-spin the order form,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.100]   make sure it's in SAP, make sure it's in our CPQ system.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.200]   That process is still three, four hours sometimes,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.120]   and at the end of quarter,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.200]   three, four hours feels like eternity.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.800]   So how can we do that fast?
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   Well, CIOs right now are the two.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.380]   The CFO and CRO are their biggest stakeholder,
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.100]   and if your product is in path to that,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.300]   you'll always get that CIO meeting.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.320]   But you have to make it really quick,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.960]   because I talk to seven, eight CIOs a day,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.840]   and that's what I constantly see on the pattern matching.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.000]   - Excellent, we have time for one more question, Peter.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.840]   - All right, you talked a lot about use cases.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.080]   I'm curious if you have any stories of use cases
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.780]   with AI that worked really well,
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.720]   and use cases with AI that really did not work at all.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.080]   - Yeah, so one of the things I would say,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:36.600]   trying to read documents and understand documents,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.000]   which is accounts payable, invoices, and this and that,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.800]   it is still very hard for AI to crack that,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.280]   and we have tried multiple different ways,
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.300]   and people talk about OCR and this and that,
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.160]   and that is a junkyard of technologies that we have tried
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.860]   and not been able to crack through,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.800]   because if you can automate the paperwork,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.000]   invoice matching, and other things,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.560]   there is still a lot of dollars to be had on productivity,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.760]   on booking the revenue, and so on.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   Where we have seen the most is simple things
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.280]   like predicting X for our use cases,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.760]   specifically for our use cases.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.100]   So for example, say a large bank.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.360]   Their policy is that if you use your computer,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.320]   every three years you can refresh your computer,
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.140]   say your Mac.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.160]   We can do that now with AI, and we can say,
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.680]   "Hey, Julie, you're four months away
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.040]   "from your entitled computer refresh,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.220]   "and we have already notified IT,
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.480]   "and you will get your new computer on that third,"
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.240]   so the depreciation and all those schedules work,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.560]   and say yes if you agree,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.120]   because we still want human in the loop,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.080]   because nobody likes.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.980]   So far, companies don't like if we just make the decision.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.160]   That's where we see that when we see the pattern matching
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.040]   and can we predict better and make it easy
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.940]   is where we are seeing the highest leverage
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.360]   on even generative AI.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.720]   - Amazing.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.400]   CJ, this is fabulous.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.880]   I wanna tie together some findings here.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.320]   Really, this is unique in that we had two separate areas.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.920]   First is application layer.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.760]   We've been talking about this throughout the day,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.160]   and here's someone who has done it
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.360]   incredibly successfully at massive scale.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.880]   You talked about who's the buyer,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.920]   what is the size of the prize,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.800]   and who are you competing against,
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.720]   and also the overlooked customer.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   In this case, the chief irrelevant officer.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.360]   You said that really actually is incredibly powerful.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.440]   I'll tell a quick story, which is at dinner with you
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.880]   and Bill from ServiceNow a little while ago,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.360]   you guys said to me, hey, you get to a building,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.480]   you go to the elevator, what floor do you go to?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.100]   I said, I don't know, what floor?
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.440]   The top.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.700]   Okay, great, you get off at the top floor.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.040]   Where do you go from there?
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.240]   Bathroom?
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.220]   No, the corner.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.640]   That's the person who's the buyer,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.400]   and that seems like it permeates your mentality.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.380]   And two, actually focusing on the customer.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.920]   Each of you in this room, if you succeed,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.720]   will try to sell to the likes of ServiceNow,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.480]   a billion dollar cloud spend business.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   And you gave us a great guide here with AI.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.720]   For you, you're looking at small language models,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.040]   not just the biggest ones.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.240]   You're looking at cost.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.720]   You're looking at open source.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.360]   1% gross margin matters to you.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.800]   That's how you build an 82% gross margin,
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.540]   160 billion dollar business,
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.880]   and actually understand the customer.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.000]   Don't just go to the marketing website
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.560]   and try to guess what ServiceNow does.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.040]   Talk to people who've built it.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.160]   This is fabulous.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   CJ, any parting words for the team?
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.600]   - Nothing, it was a pleasure,
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.160]   and I'm always around if you want any words of wisdom.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.780]   I've made a lot of mistakes as well, too many,
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.320]   in terms of scaling ServiceNow.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.680]   From a product perspective, engineering perspective,
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.120]   which use cases you prioritize, which you don't,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.620]   how do you ring fence the team
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.560]   when you go for the second act,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.920]   and really, really get focused?
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.160]   So, lots of mistakes as well,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.560]   but we are constantly learning.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.400]   - Fabulous.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.240]   CJ, one last question for you.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.560]   Will you do stand-up for us later on tonight?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.440]   - No, I will not do stand-up today.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.040]   It's my stand-up when I used to do it.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.880]   Nowadays, I'll get canceled very fast,
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.080]   and Bill will not appreciate that, so I will not do it.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.920]   - Well, there we go.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.740]   That one's off record.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.580]   Thank you, CJ.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.420]   - Thank you.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.420]   (audience applauds)
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.580]   (upbeat music)
