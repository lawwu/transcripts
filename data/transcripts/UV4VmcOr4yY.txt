[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Now we are completing this evening our consideration of this final section of this first chapter
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.560]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans, which runs from verse 18 to the end of the chapter. The
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   apostle says that he glories in the gospel and is ready to preach it not only because
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.680]   of its own intrinsic worth and merit, but because the wrath of God has also been revealed
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:40.840]   from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   And we have been seeing that the wrath of God is revealed for these two reasons, because
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.440]   of the character of sin, ungodliness and unrighteousness, but also because men have deliberately held
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.280]   down the truth. God had revealed the truth concerning himself, not the full truth concerning
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   himself, but sufficient to render mankind inexcusable. He had done so in creation, he
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   had done so in providence, he had done so in history. We were considering that last
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.600]   Friday night. But in spite of that, though God had revealed himself, and man is thus
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.520]   without excuse, man, because of his unrighteousness, because of his sin, had restrained or had
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.600]   resisted, suppressed the truth. And we ended last Friday evening by asking this question,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.360]   why had he done that? And we found that Paul gives us three answers. First of all, it is
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.800]   men's pride. You remember the phrase in which he puts it, "Professing themselves to be wise,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.280]   they became fools." Man is always anxious to be a philosopher, professing themselves
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.080]   to be wise. That was the first thing, pride. The second thing was wickedness. In other
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.720]   words, it was this unrighteousness, this delight in evil and in sin. And the third thing was
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.520]   that they lost their spiritual sense. Their foolish heart was darkened. They lost their
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.200]   spiritual understanding. Very well. There then is the position at which we have arrived.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.360]   Man holds down the truth, suppresses the truth, and that is why man does so. But now we must
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.840]   go on to consider this. How exactly has man done that? Having seen the things in man in
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   sin that makes him do it, how does he do it? And here again the apostle gives us the answer,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   and they're perfectly plain. Now let me show you the teaching of this paragraph. I've
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   divided it up into two headings. First of all, he tells us that mankind has suppressed
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   the truth that God has revealed, first of all, in its attitude towards God. Now these
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   are the phrases. Take verse 21, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.640]   not as God." That's the first thing. Having this knowledge of God in creation, the invisible
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.320]   things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.860]   things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. In spite of that, mankind does
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:00.320]   not glorify God as God. That just means this, that mankind doesn't praise God, doesn't
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   give him his rightful place in its life and in its thought. In other words, man in sin
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.320]   does not live to the glory of God. Man made God for his own glory's sake and in order
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.420]   that men might glorify him. The heavens are telling the glory of God, the whole of creation
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:31.160]   does, but the very acme of God's creation is man, whom he made in his own image. And
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:39.440]   man above everything else was meant to show forth the glory of God. But as the man who
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.600]   wrote the 104th Psalm tells us, it is man alone who doesn't do that. Read that Psalm.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.920]   It's a most wonderful Psalm on this very theme. He'll show you how everything in creation
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.520]   manifests the glory of God by obeying the law of its nature. Man alone doesn't do so.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.000]   So he ends by saying, "Let the sinner be consumed from the earth." The one who was
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.800]   meant to manifest God's glory above everything else is the one who fails. When they knew
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:17.120]   God, they glorified him not as God. Their whole attitude towards him is antagonistic.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.640]   Indeed, as Paul puts it later on in the eighth chapter of this epistle, the natural mind
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   is enmity against God and is not subject to the law of God. Very well, but it doesn't
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:39.320]   stop at that. Not only do they not glorify him, but he says also, "Neither were thankful."
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   I needn't stay with these things. We all know what they mean. We've all been so guilty of
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.760]   every one of them. Man doesn't thank God for his mercy, for his goodness, for his kindness
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.200]   and all his dealings with us in providence. We take the sunshine for granted. We are annoyed
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.400]   if we don't get it. We take the rain for granted. How often do we thank God for all these gifts
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.520]   and blessings? Now if we as Christians fail in this respect, how much more so does the
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.560]   world fail? "God sendeth his rain," as our Lord reminds us in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.880]   "and the sun upon the good and the evil, the just and the unjust." But mankind doesn't
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.320]   realize that. It doesn't stop to thank God. "Neither were thankful." He's the giver of
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.920]   every good and every perfect gift. He's the father of mercies. And yet people go through
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   the whole of their lives in this world and they never thank him. "Neither were thankful."
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.080]   Ignore him completely. That's how they show this attitude of theirs towards God. It's
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   in this way they suppress the truth that has been revealed concerning God. And then there's
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.280]   a most extraordinary statement in verse 28, which is the third way in which mankind does
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:10.080]   this. Listen. "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge," God gave
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.680]   them over to a reprobate mind. Now I'm interested in the first part of the statement. "They
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:23.480]   did not like to retain God in their knowledge." What does that mean? Well, the Revised Standard
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.240]   Version puts it like this, "They did not see fit to acknowledge God." But even that's
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.720]   much too weak. What it really means is this. They did not approve of God. Because the word
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   that the apostle uses is this. It's the word that is used for testing. It was the word
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:51.360]   that was implied for testing metals, gold, and so on. A lump of material was put on your
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.240]   desk and the question is, is this gold or is it not? Is it a value or isn't it? They
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.000]   tested it by various tests. That's the word that's used. You apply tests. And what the
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.160]   apostle is saying is this. That mankind, having considered God, having examined him, having
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.880]   tested him, decided to reject him. Like the scientist who, given this lump, says, "No,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:24.280]   this isn't pure gold. This is an alloy. Throw it away." That's the attitude of mankind
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:33.560]   towards God. They consider God. They are the judges, you see. And God is a subject for
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:39.640]   examination. Oh yes, this is very interesting. Now let's see about this. God, oh yes, you
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.720]   say you believe in God. And so they consider God. They're going to examine God. They're
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.360]   going to test God. And having done so, and in spite of this full knowledge which God
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:57.560]   has given in that particular manner, they decide that they're not interested. It's
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.120]   not worth their while to bother any longer about God. Now, the apostle Paul wrote this,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.440]   remember, 1900 years ago. But you see what a perfect description it is of mankind this
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.080]   evening? How interesting to have a discussion about religion and to talk about God. Should
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   God do this or shouldn't he do that? And what I think about God. They examine God and
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.440]   reject him. They did not like to retain him in their knowledge. What an appalling state.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.560]   What a terrible condition. That is the state of mankind in sin. They did not think it worth
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:41.160]   their while to retain God in their knowledge. They deliberately put him on one side. And
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.920]   it is still what men does in sin. And the fourth thing they did is this, the
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.560]   thing that's mentioned in verse 32, the last verse. "Who, knowing the judgment of
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.760]   God that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:09.000]   have pleasure in them that do them." What does that mean? It means this, that they deliberately
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.840]   ignore their knowledge of God's judgment on sin. I needn't stay with this, we touched
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.160]   it last Friday evening. There is in every human being a sense of right and wrong. There
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.960]   is a conscience, there is a feeling that if we do certain things we are going to be punished,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   and that we deserve to be punished. But in spite of knowing that, mankind not only does
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.280]   such things, but it rejoices and has pleasure in them that do them. In other words, men
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.080]   not only do these things, they talk about them, and they joke about them, they boast
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.040]   about them. One has to sit and listen to it in railway compartments, especially in restaurant
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.760]   cars I find. Men, actually intelligent men, boasting about their drinking and things like
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.440]   that, have pleasure in them that do them. Not only make beasts of themselves, but rather
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.840]   like to tell the story, and to enjoy it as they tell one another. That's the position.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   And this is done deliberately, in spite, says the apostle, of what they know. They act in
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   this way, and in this manner. Well now, there it is, if you like, in theory, that is their
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:26.400]   attitude towards God. But what is it in practice? Well, in practice he tells us it's this.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.520]   They not only have put on one side this full knowledge which they have of God, now I keep
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.760]   on repeating that word, you notice, because that is the word that Paul uses in verse 28.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.120]   Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge. Now the word translated "knowledge"
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.760]   here, rarely means full knowledge. What it means is, the knowledge that God has given
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.520]   of himself in the revelation. And what he says is, therefore, that having decided that
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   they don't want this full knowledge of God that God has given, they now decide to make
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:14.080]   their own gods, and to worship them. You see, in a sense, they don't want to finish with
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.760]   the idea of God altogether. But they don't want God as he is. They don't want God as
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.160]   he has revealed himself. So what they do now is, they're going to make their own God, or
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:32.240]   their own gods. And here the apostle tells us in verses 23 and 25, as to how they have
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:40.200]   done that. "And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   men and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things." Verse 25, "Who changed the
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:57.000]   truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:08.400]   who is blessed forever. Amen." Now what does this mean? Well, you notice how he puts it.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:16.680]   They reject the glory of the uncorruptible God. Uncorruptible means this, of course,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.600]   that there is no element of decay. It's a reference to God's eternity, from everlasting
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.080]   to everlasting. It's a reference to God's spirituality. It is a reference indeed to
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:35.720]   God's glorious attributes in all their plenitude and fullness. The immortal God they set on
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:45.800]   one side, the glorious God they reject. And what do they do? They make gods for themselves.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.960]   What sort of gods? Well, you've seen photographs of some of the heathen images, haven't you?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.480]   Some of them look like men, as Paul tells us here. They changed the glory of the uncorruptible
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.400]   God into an image made like to corruptible men. And as has often been pointed out, haven't
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:12.040]   you noticed how hideous all these images are? These gods in human likeness and in human
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.600]   forms, they're not even decent human beings, as it were. There's something vile and foul
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.640]   and horrible about them. You look at these images and you'll see what I mean. Well,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.440]   some of them they've made in the form of men, but they haven't stopped even at that.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.320]   Some of them they make in the form of birds. Some of them in the form of four-footed beasts,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.520]   cows and sheep. They've set these things up as God's golden calves, and they're
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:51.000]   still doing that sort of thing. The sacred animal and so on. And even creeping things
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.480]   like snakes and lizards and things of that kind. All these things have been turned into
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.040]   gods and they've made their images in these forms. And then having made them, they proceed
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:10.120]   to worship them. This is a part of the process. This is how men have done all this. But then
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:17.720]   in verse 25, he puts it in a slightly different form. They change the truth of God, he says,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:26.240]   into a lie. What he means is that they have turned what is the truth about God into something
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.360]   that they think is the truth, which is actually not the truth. In other words, it is a lie.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   What's he referring to? Well, he's referring, if you like, to mythology. All Greek mythology
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.080]   and other mythologies and so on, with their talk about gods. That's the thing the apostle
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:51.040]   has got in his mind here. And in addition to that, superstitions and all the various
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.560]   forms of idolatry. And of course, in doing all this, you see, they have been putting
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:06.680]   the creature before the Creator himself. Now, what mankind has done in sin, therefore, you
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:15.320]   see, can be put in this form. Man in sin sets on one side the essential glory of God, the
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:24.600]   real truth about God. He sets aside God's spirituality, his infinity, his eternity,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:31.800]   his majesty, and the fact that God is spirit, that he is immaterial. But they materialize
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.360]   him. They give him a bodily form, an appearance. You see, in doing all this, they are simply
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   denying the truth about God. The whole of mythology, the whole of idolatry, all superstition,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:54.160]   is nothing but a lie. It is an attempt to reduce the eternal, everlasting, glorious
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:01.080]   God of heaven into terms that are comprehensible by men and that can be handled by men. That's
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:11.960]   what the apostle says. Instead of receiving and accepting God's revelation of himself,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.280]   they substitute their own ideas of God. And having put them up, they bow down to them
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:24.360]   and worship them. In those olden times, and still in certain parts of the world today,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.160]   they do it, as I say, literally in making their gods out of wood and stone and precious
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   metals and so on. But in principle, the same thing is being done by philosophy. They substitute
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:50.080]   their own ideas, and every time they do so, they are detracting from the glory of God.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.800]   In other words, no image, no picture, can ever represent God. It's always a detraction
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.880]   from his glory. And any attempt, therefore, to represent God, as the Ten Commandments
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:10.640]   tell us, is guilty of this lie about God. You must make no graven image to represent
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:16.520]   God even. It's always a detraction from him. And the apostle puts this in these sublime
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:25.600]   words in verse 25, which we're looking at. "Who changed the truth about God into a lie,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.880]   and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.000]   Amen." Have you ever been surprised at this "Amen"
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.520]   that suddenly comes like this in the middle of a passage? Why do you think the apostle
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.920]   said "Amen" at that point? Well, of course, the explanation is simple. It's this. The
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:59.520]   apostle thinks in contradistinction to all these images and idols and all these lies
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:10.640]   about God as he really is, and he pauses in worship and in adoration and in praise. And
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   thereby I think he teaches us a very great lesson. The very name of God should be an
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.560]   object of reverence. You know that the Jews didn't use the name Jehovah. They felt it
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:35.960]   was too sacred. Somehow or another we've lost this. But the apostle calls us back to
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:45.920]   it here. The very thought of God in his transcendence, in his majesty and infinity, and in his glory
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:52.560]   should humble us. We should speak of him with reverence and with godly fear. "Amen,"
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.800]   says the apostle. In other words, in the midst of his argument, he contemplates God and is
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.160]   silenced and, as it were, forgets his own argument for a moment. Because you can't
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.080]   speak of God like that. You've got to stop and worship him at the very mention of his
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:13.160]   name. Very well, let us learn these simple lessons
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:22.120]   as we pass. We put the creature before the Creator every time we put any single idea
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:32.960]   of our own before the revelation of Scripture. I feel like repeating that. To put any idea
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:38.520]   of our own before Scripture is to be guilty of this very thing, of putting the creature
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:44.080]   before the Creator. Our ideas, rather than what the Bible says or what God has revealed.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.280]   "Ah," we say, "but I don't understand that. I don't quite see how God would be
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:54.560]   fair if he did this and that." All right. That's what you say, that's what you think.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.360]   The question is, what is revealed? What does God say about himself? My friends, we are
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.560]   not meant to understand all we read in the Scriptures. It's beyond us. Our minds are
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:12.240]   too small and we are born in sin. We come to this as little children, not to comprehend
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:19.720]   it all, but to worship and to praise. We receive it. And if you start putting your ideas, your
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.160]   difficulties, your thoughts, your feelings before the Scripture, you've already partly
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:31.640]   become guilty of this terrible, horrible charge of putting and worshipping the creature before
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:39.920]   the Creator. Let us, I say, therefore, always approach
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.360]   the Word of God with reverence and with humility. Let us never come to it or read it without
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:53.560]   praying to be illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Let us come to learn, not to have our own
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.320]   prejudices confirmed or to turn something down. Let us come, I say, with open minds.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:08.200]   Let us receive the Word, lest in our modern fashion we may be guilty of this very thing
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:15.800]   with which the Apostle charges those people of ancient time. And above all, I say, let
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:28.120]   us ever, as we think of him and talk about him, remember who he is and what he is.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:35.040]   We forget that sometimes, don't we? Something's been going wrong. Like that man in the 73rd
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.320]   Psalm, we've been having a hard time, and the ungodly is very prosperous. And we begin
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.920]   to say, "Hoy, that's God!" Oh, my dear friend, the next time that thought or feeling
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.440]   arises in your breast, stop for a moment and remember you're thinking and speaking about
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:03.800]   the uncorruptible God, the Creator who is blessed forever, this glorious being, glorious
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:13.560]   in his holiness, infinite in his majesty. Let us put our hands upon our mouths and be
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:23.040]   content to wait until he reveals his purpose to us, how dangerous it is to speak without
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:34.880]   thinking about God, the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen. Let's stop for a moment. God
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   forbid that we should ever be guilty of speaking about God in a manner that is unworthy. However,
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:50.800]   we must press on. Now, that is how mankind has suppressed the truth.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.840]   The next matter, therefore, we consider is this, the results of doing that. What has
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.120]   all this led to? Again, let me summarize the teaching of the apostle for you. The first
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.320]   thing he tells us is this, that as a result of all this and doing all this, men have become
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:19.640]   fools, verse 22, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. How easy it would
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:27.720]   be to spend not only the rest of this evening, but many evenings in just expanding that.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:36.000]   Men and women in sin, there is only one thing to say about them, they are fools. The fool
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.080]   hath said in his heart, "There is no God," and anybody who says there is no God is nothing
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.360]   but a fool. How do we see that? How do we know that? Well, the apostle has just been
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.640]   telling us in the words I've been quoting to you. You see, any man who thinks that he
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:05.760]   can examine God and having done so can dismiss him, is just saying that he's a fool. May
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:14.920]   I put that in the form of an illustration? You will hear people saying sometimes that
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:24.000]   they just see nothing at all in Beethoven's music, but they think jazz is marvelous. Now,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.800]   they tell me nothing about Beethoven, but they tell me a great deal about themselves.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.720]   They don't realize it, of course. They think they're being clever, but they're really just
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.040]   telling us all about themselves from the standpoint of a knowledge of music, aren't they? Professing
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:48.680]   themselves to be wise, they became fools. Yes, and it's not only in this fact that they
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:55.120]   think that they're capable of assessing God and dismissing him. Look what they worship.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:05.080]   Is that wisdom? Is it wisdom to bow down before an idol, or something in the form of a lizard,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:17.240]   or a cow, or a calf? Is that wisdom? Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:25.940]   They say they can't believe in God, but they can believe in evolution. With all its contradictions
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.600]   and all its monstrosities, they can believe that, they'll swallow that. They say, "I can't
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:39.320]   swallow a miracle." But look what they swallow when they accept the theory of evolution.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.480]   They can't believe in God, they say, but they seem to believe in astrology, don't they?
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.160]   They don't believe that there's a great God deciding men's fate and determining everything,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   but they believe the stars do that. Is that wisdom? Professing themselves to be wise,
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   they became fools. They won't worship the God of heaven, they feel that's degrading.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:09.880]   They'll worship a human leader, the leader cult. We've seen it in Hitlerism, Mussoliniism,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:18.600]   and indeed in other ways which I could mention, but perhaps I'd better not. The tendency
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.160]   almost to deify certain great men, I'm not sure we're not partly guilty of it in this
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:36.680]   country, as if they were gods and can do no wrong. Leader worship. Is that wisdom? Oh,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:44.200]   they think it's very insulting to ask them to bow down before God, and yet they will
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:51.760]   worship men and women. We read about the so-called fans that people have in various professions.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.840]   I shall never forget reading about twenty years ago, I suppose by now, a certain famous
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   film star died, and one read in the newspaper that a number of women when they read that
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   literally fainted. You remember it? Is that wisdom? They'll stand for hours to see these
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.640]   people, they'll stay up all night. It's insulting to give time to God, but this is
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:26.400]   all right. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. Indeed, there is no question
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.960]   about it that there are many people in the world today who are worshipping animals. They
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:37.040]   talk to them as if they were human beings. They won't go away without them, they're
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.800]   worried about them, they live for them, and when the animal should die, they're lost,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:49.120]   they don't know what to do. I'm not reminiscing these things are facts. Professing themselves
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:57.480]   to be wise, they dismiss the God of heaven, the glorious everlasting being, and this is
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:05.080]   what they do instead. But come, they're not only fools, they're also foul. Listen
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:11.760]   to verse twenty-four, "Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   of their own hearts to dishonor their bodies between themselves." Oh, the foulness of
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:28.880]   sin, the uncleanness of it all, the squalor, the way they even dishonor the body that God
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:35.600]   has given us. But then in verse twenty-six I read this, "For this cause God gave them
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.640]   up unto vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.600]   is against nature, and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman burned
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:55.400]   in their lust one toward another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.640]   in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.040]   to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:16.280]   things which are not convenient." We needn't go into these things. Alas, unfortunately,
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:22.720]   we all know more than we should know, perhaps, about these things. And our modern world is
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:32.160]   full of them, vile affections, horrible perversions. But people are defending them. They're even
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.320]   trying to say there's something marvelous about them, there's something really beautiful.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   They say it isn't sin. Ah, they say you've been too harsh in all this. It's being defended
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:51.200]   today. Things which are not convenient, I read here in verse 28, it means things contrary
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:31:00.520]   to nature, violating the law of man's physical being, improper. They're not only fools, but
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:08.720]   they're foul. And let's be clear about it and use plain language, as the apostle does.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:16.240]   Life today has become foul. There's no other word to use. Indeed, he goes on to say that
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:25.360]   it's also become vile and violent and vicious. I'm summarizing verses 29 to 32. "Being filled
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:32.560]   with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:40.240]   murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.840]   boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:53.440]   breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful, who, knowing the judgment of God
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.480]   that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:11.160]   in them that do." I say it's vile, it's violent, it's vicious. But that is the result, you
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   see, of dismissing God as you find Him, and putting your own ideas up. This is the result
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:28.320]   of not glorifying Him as God, nor being thankful to Him, but exalting your own wisdom, your
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:40.680]   own mind and understanding. That's what it leads to. Fools, foul, vile, violent, vicious.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.080]   We are seeing it all in this modern world. You see, it doesn't matter whether it happened
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:52.640]   at the flood, or whether it happened at this point, nearly two thousand years ago, or whether
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.840]   it happens now. It's always the same. These things are universal. That's why I don't
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.640]   gallop through the epistle to the Romans. You see, this word is speaking to England
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:09.880]   today, to the whole world at this moment. And we've got to face these things. And we
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:18.360]   must bring others to see them. Because finally, the apostle tells us here about God's view
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   of it all, and God's judgment on it all. You see the steps and the stages? Because
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.600]   of their pride and their wickedness, and their spiritual darkness, that is what they do.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.920]   And that leads to these results. And what does God say about it all? Well, the apostle
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.240]   answers in three statements. It's the same statement, rarely repeated three times. It's
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:57.480]   first of all in verse 24, "Wherefore, because of this, God also gave them up." Verse 26,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:05.400]   "For this cause God gave them up." Verse 28, "And even as they did not like to retain God
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   in their knowledge, God gave them up." God gave them over. It doesn't matter which, it's
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:19.880]   the same word. Three times over it's there. The apostle was so anxious that this should
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.800]   be understood that he repeats it, you see. He says it three times over. Men are so ready
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:32.080]   to forget it and to ignore it. The apostle wants them to be perfectly clear about it.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:39.480]   When mankind refuses to glorify God as God, when mankind doesn't thank him and praise
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:52.720]   him and worship him as it ought, and in its cleverness dismisses him, throws him out,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.360]   what God does is to do exactly the same to mankind. There's a play on words in this 28th
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.800]   verse. "Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God did not like to
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:14.120]   retain them, but gave them up, left them to themselves. They abandoned God, God abandoned
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.080]   them." That's what he's saying. So in other words, what we have here is an account of
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:30.320]   God's judicial abandonment of men in sin. God abandoned them. And you notice he even
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.840]   abandoned them in their minds, which is the most terrifying and terrible thing of all.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.720]   Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, in their great brains that
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   they're always talking about, God gave them over to a reprobate, a rejected mind, a foolish
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:55.580]   mind, a mind that's fooling itself constantly and going round and round in circles and really
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:02.920]   has lost its power of apprehending truth. God has abandoned them to them. So that the
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:10.320]   tragedy of men in the world today is not only that he's debased in his conduct, he is debased
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:18.320]   in his mind. He can't think straight. That's why he tries to justify these vile things
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.440]   and tries to explain them in terms of biology or psychology and so on, and to say, you know,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.320]   this isn't sin, this is really something medical, and perhaps not even that, perhaps
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:37.720]   after all it's really the height of beauty. Reprobate mind. When a man's mind has gone
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:45.680]   like that, there's no hope for him. There's nothing to appeal to. But then you see, the
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.240]   second thing he tells us that God has done is this in verse 27, "Likewise also the
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.640]   men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another, men with
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:07.000]   men working that which is unseemly," then here's the phrase, "and receiving in themselves
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:17.760]   that recompense of their error which was me." If you like, you can put it like this. God
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:26.200]   abandons men because of his wrong attitude, and the result of God abandoning men is that
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:37.400]   men behave in the way that we've been looking at. That's the recompense of their error that
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:46.800]   is meat and fitting. In other words, it is God who preserves morality in this world.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.480]   Man in his foolish pride thinks that he can preserve morality without God. They've been
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.320]   preaching that a great deal for the last hundred years, but you see what happens? It always
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:04.400]   happens. Man cannot preserve morality. When he tries to do so, this is what you get as
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.040]   a result, these perversions and all that we are witnessing in the world today. It is God
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.480]   alone that can preserve morality, and when God withdraws himself, you see what happens.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:24.640]   You enter into this vileness and filth and foulness. And that is what they deserve, says
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:33.400]   Paul. That is the recompense that is meat for such creatures. God withdraws his restraining
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:43.440]   grace, and all the foulness and the vileness that is in men as the result of sin is given
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:55.040]   free scope. It's let loose, and the world becomes a kind of living hell.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:04.680]   Very well then, let me make my final comments, which are these. The world as it is this evening
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:14.240]   is the greatest proof possible of the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:22.600]   of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness. Our world this very evening, with its baffling
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.960]   moral problems, with its incredible moral muddle, with all the loudness and the ugliness
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.440]   and the foulness which is increasing, is just an absolute proof of what the apostle says
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:40.680]   here. It is God's wrath against sin. You can't explain it in any other terms. I defy
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:50.240]   you to. There is no other explanation. You see, we'd been taught that education and
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   culture and moral lectures and moral societies were going to do it, but they can't do it,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.160]   and they're not doing it. No, no. This is a part of the wrath of God against sin. So
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:08.520]   the modern world proves itself that the doctrine which it hates above every doctrine, the doctrine
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:15.880]   of the wrath of God, is actually a fact. Because the wrath of God manifests itself in that
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:24.280]   way, that God withdraws his restraining grace and abandons men to himself. And the result
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:36.200]   is what we see. My other comment is this. Hell is just that
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:47.920]   exaggerated and going on to all eternity. That is hell. Hell is a condition in which
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:56.680]   life is lived outside God and all the restraint of God's holiness. And that's what it is.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:03.840]   All this that you've got described here, exaggerated, still worse, and going on endlessly.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.080]   In other words, hell is people living to all eternity the kind of life they're living
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:19.840]   now, only that it's much more so. That's hell. Can you imagine anything worse? It's
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:28.680]   men and women without any control at all, finally abandoned by God. He gave them over,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:36.040]   he gives them over eternally. And they're just left to themselves and to manifest all
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:45.800]   that is in them of this foulness and vileness. I don't know what you feel, my friends,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:56.040]   but I feel this as I say these things. Thank God for Romans 1, 16 and 17. In the light
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:05.480]   of all this, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:11.720]   salvation to every one that believeth. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:18.440]   from faith to faith, as it is written, "The just shall live by faith." What else could
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:28.680]   have saved any one of us from such a condition and from such a hell? Thank God for it. And
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:38.080]   thank God that he's ever opened our eyes to see it. Ah, yes, but the inevitable corollary.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:45.720]   What of the men and women who are still in it? Are we content just to go on enjoying
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.880]   our salvation and our knowledge and our position? All mankind outside Christ comes into this
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:00.240]   passage. They're not all equally foul, but they don't glorify him as God and they
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   don't thank him. And they're in the same company and they'll spend eternity in the
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   same company. The most respectable people, as well as the vilest, they all are in the
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:21.120]   same group. If we believe these things, we must not only have a great heart of compassion
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:31.160]   for them, as we see their appalling condition and as we see what awaits them. We must pray
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:37.320]   God so to manifest this power of his in the gospel. We must so pray, I say, for revival
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:43.200]   and for reawakening, for the power of the Holy Ghost to open the eyes of men and women,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.880]   where it be too late. If we really believe this teaching, we will all go from this service
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:59.440]   tonight determined no longer to live a life of ease and of rest and of enjoyment. We must
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.000]   feel the burden of the souls that are round and about us by the million in this condition.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.840]   We can't do anything about them. It's no use going to talk merely into reason. It
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.600]   needs the convicting power of the Holy Ghost. It was the only thing that availed in the
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.960]   time of Paul. He didn't preach with enticing words of men's wisdom. He preached in demonstration
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.400]   of the Spirit and of power. And nothing else will touch it. They won't listen to anything
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:36.000]   else. It has no effect, finally. But the power of the Holy Ghost can and does and will. Let
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:44.920]   us plead, let us yearn for God to visit us with revival power. That all who are privileged
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:50.840]   to preach the gospel and all individual Christians, as they talk to men and women, may open their
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:45:01.000]   eyes to these things, but may go on to tell them of the power of God unto salvation, of
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:11.400]   the righteousness of God by faith in Jesus Christ, which can make the foulest clean of
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:18.000]   the blood of Christ, his perfect righteousness and obedience with which they can be clothed,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.040]   that they can be washed, that they can be sanctified, that they can be justified in
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:33.640]   the name of the Lord Jesus and by the power of the Spirit of God.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:42.720]   Oh, may God imprint these things so deeply upon our minds and hearts that we shall be
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:53.160]   so burdened and pray God to have mercy and to give yet another opportunity, ere it be
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:00.320]   too late. Let us pray.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:09.000]   Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we come again with humble praise and thanksgiving
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.560]   to thank thee that thou hast opened our eyes to see these things, our desperate condition
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:26.480]   and the glory and the fullness and the power of the gospel. Oh God, we know not how to
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:34.840]   thank thee. We are debtors to thy mercy and love. Oh, hear us as we pray for those who
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   are without, for all who are still blinded by sin and Satan and are held still in this
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:54.360]   foul bondage and captivity. God, have mercy upon them. Oh Lord, we pray and beseech thee,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.120]   revive thy work.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:04.400]   We manifest again the power that was seen here in this city of London two hundred years
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.600]   ago in that great evangelical awakening when men corresponding to what we have read of
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:20.680]   this evening were by the thousands saved and delivered under the preaching of thy servants
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:27.440]   filled with the Holy Ghost. We know that thou art still the same, that thine arm is not
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:39.520]   shortened. Oh God, revive thy work and come in Pentecostal power. And unto thee and unto
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:46.720]   thee alone shall we give all the praise and all the honor and all the glory. In the name
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:53.640]   of thy dear Son, our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:00.200]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:09.240]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night until, if
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:16.800]   it be thy will, we meet again in October, throughout the remainder of this hour's short,
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:25.960]   uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall stand before thee face to face
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:38.480]   and enter into thine eternal and everlasting glory. Amen.
