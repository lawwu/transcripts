[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.000]   Gracious Lord, we again are grateful tonight
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.760]   for the opportunity to be able to study marriage
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.200]   and the family from scripture.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.160]   And we have covered an awful lot of material
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.240]   already this semester.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.760]   And as we go into our final sessions together,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   I pray that you'll continue to help us to be alert.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680]   This has been a good class.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.680]   We've had a wonderful time together
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.240]   interacting on a variety of issues
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.540]   that deal with marriage and parenting and the home.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.800]   And now we're entering into a territory
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.480]   that are some of the more controversial and hot topics.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080]   I pray that you'll help us to understand them
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.760]   as your word addresses them sufficiently.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880]   This we ask in Christ's name, amen.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.000]   All right.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.800]   Tonight we want to work on the issue of blended families.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.080]   So if you have your material there in front of you
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.600]   or your student outline, it is on what page is that?
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080]   It's on page 70.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.520]   OK.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.120]   It is on page 70.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.320]   So let's see if we can talk about this.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.200]   Dealing with blended family conflicts in counseling,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.640]   I think, is one of the most challenging types of counseling
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.100]   for marriage and the family that you will face.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.480]   This is a tough issue.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.960]   And there's a lot of heated exchange
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920]   that usually goes on in blended family counseling.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.480]   And in just a little bit, we're going
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.560]   to take a look at a case study we've entitled Larry and Judy.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.600]   But let me make a couple of comments by way of preface.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   The term blended family really is
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.840]   somewhat of a misleading term.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.640]   It's a secular term.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.720]   And in fact, the usage of the label
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   by a lot of sociologists and psychologists,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   whether they call themselves Christians or not,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.340]   creates, I think, more ambiguity in dealing
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.960]   with the problems that occur in blended families
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.680]   and somewhat typifies the reason why
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.160]   there is so much struggle and difficulty in resolving
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.080]   the problems that that terminology represents.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.160]   What are we talking about?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   We're talking about two distinct people, a husband and a wife,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.180]   with their respective children, who are properly married,
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.680]   is what oftentimes is referred to as a blended family.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   They bring their respective children
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   into that relationship from a previous relationship
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.240]   and/or previous marriage.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.480]   In reality, from a biblical standpoint,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.440]   it does not represent a blended family.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.400]   They form a family.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.720]   You follow what I'm saying?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.600]   It doesn't represent a blended family.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   They form a family.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.280]   Whether they or their children wish to acknowledge it or not,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   they are one in God's eyes.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.600]   They're not blended.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.240]   And I believe that we have to resist the human tendency
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.320]   to think of them as two distinct families living
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.040]   under one roof who, in a sense, have to put up or learn
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.800]   how to cope with one another.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   All right, I'll tell you again, I hate that word cope.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.200]   We ought to get rid of that out of Christian vocabulary.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.480]   We're not here to help people cope.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.680]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say that.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.320]   We're here to help people resolve problems biblically,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000]   not learn how to cope with each other, which basically
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.760]   translated in popular cultural slang as, OK, I'm
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   going to teach you how to put up with the other person
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.440]   and how to just kind of survive this misery, cope.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.040]   No, we're not going to teach people how to survive misery.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.980]   We want to teach them how to respond biblically
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.560]   to the hardships and the unique problems
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.040]   that blended families present.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.200]   So whether we like it or not, they are--
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.240]   whether they like it or not, they
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.600]   are one family in God's eyes, not blended.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.000]   So I believe that we have to resist the human tendency
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   to think of them as two distinct families living under one roof.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.380]   What God has joined together are no longer two, but one.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.060]   Now, I fully realize they may not feel like they're a family.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.540]   They may not even function like one family.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.660]   And they certainly don't consider themselves
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.940]   to be one family unit, especially
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.420]   if you talk with the respective children of either one
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.900]   of the spouses.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.940]   But that does not change the fact that they are.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.540]   When I first went in the military,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.480]   I didn't feel like a soldier.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.020]   I didn't function like a soldier.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.260]   And I certainly didn't think like a soldier.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.960]   But that didn't change the fact that I was a soldier.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.720]   That's who I was.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.220]   In other words, listen, at the very core of their problems
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.140]   is the way that they choose to think and actually believe
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.720]   certain things about themselves.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.960]   At the very core of their problems
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.320]   is the way that they choose to think and believe
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.640]   about themselves.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.600]   So probably, I would like to call them
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.480]   step-family with step-parenting and step-partnering problems,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.720]   because that really is where the problems lie.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.240]   Now, what I would like to do is I
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.280]   would like to give you a typical scenario that you
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.320]   may face in your ministry when counseling
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.000]   this kind of a family.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.840]   And if this scenario sounds like any particular family that you
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.240]   know, it's by coincidence, because this family
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.160]   is fictitious.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.640]   And it is built upon, really, my own experience
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.340]   in counseling step-families and reading and studying
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.040]   about this issue biblically.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.160]   According to national statistics here in America,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.280]   studies on family in America, the most typical step-family
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.520]   with problems involves a divorced father
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.000]   whose biological children live with their biological mother,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.600]   his former wife, who has--
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.280]   this divorced father has remarried a divorced woman
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.460]   with an average of two biological children of her own
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.120]   still living with her.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now, that's the national average.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.320]   Now, the case study that I want to give you
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.440]   presents something similar to that.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.640]   And I've made a few variations of this purposely in order
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.400]   to point out and highlight some things
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.780]   that I want to stress in biblical counseling.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.940]   But that's the reason why I've changed a little bit
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.600]   of this scenario.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.400]   So the variations reflect what I believe
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.800]   you're going to find in the Christian community.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.560]   And it also affords me the opportunity
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.120]   to point out some, I think, important issues and facts
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   that you're going to need to address
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.080]   that will add some clarity to counseling
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.880]   and the problems there.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.360]   So let's talk about Larry and Judy, OK?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.720]   Larry and Judy are a couple who were previously married.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.360]   And they found each other at church
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   and immediately hit it off.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.840]   In fact, I think in your student notes, I've put the scenario.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.760]   Larry has been divorced for less than two years.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.080]   But Judy's been widowed for almost eight years.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.560]   Everyone at church believed they were the ideal couple.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.520]   In fact, a couple of self-appointed matchmakers
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.600]   at church took credit for putting the two of them
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.960]   together.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.000]   And I think it's always amazing how these matchmakers fade
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.840]   into the background when it becomes obvious
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.120]   that this new family is having problems.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:15.800]   Judy has two teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son--
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.560]   so she has three kids--
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.920]   from her first marriage that's living with her.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.900]   Larry has a daughter of 13 years of age and a son of 10
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.160]   who lives with his ex-wife.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.500]   Now, during their courtship, everyone
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.960]   was excited except Judy's teenage daughters,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.880]   who stood off from the whole thing and were polite,
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.320]   but were confused and didn't know what to think.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.360]   On the one hand, they were happy that mom seemed so happy--
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.980]   in fact, happier than they could remember for years.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.360]   On the other hand, they were not comfortable with the fact
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   that Larry was taking so much of mom's time
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.040]   and was beginning to act a little like a father
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.600]   figure with them.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   He wasn't their father.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.440]   Their father was in heaven, and Larry could never
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.040]   replace their father.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.400]   Any suggestion of that was repulsive to them.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.560]   So Judy's son didn't seem to mind Larry's sudden intrusion
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.040]   into their home, however, because he was only one
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.180]   when his father had died, and he didn't really
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.160]   remember his father.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.320]   And so he always wanted a dad, and Larry
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.080]   represented for the first time in his life a father.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:36.760]   Larry's ex-wife had left him for another man, who she was still
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.040]   living with and refused to return,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.520]   even after going through church discipline with their church.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.560]   The divorce was still fresh in the minds of Larry's two
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.480]   children when they introduced them to their future step
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.560]   mother, Judy.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.840]   Well, they disliked her from the beginning.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.200]   After all, they still hoped mom and dad would eventually
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.680]   get back together again, and this new stepmother
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.480]   was a serious threat to that dream.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:10.600]   At least their biological mother had not married her boyfriend.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.700]   Both Larry and Judy noticed the awkwardness and tension
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.280]   when they first took a picnic with the two sets of children,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.400]   but both attributed it to adjustment jitters, which
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   would only be a temporary thing.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.760]   Once everyone got settled in, everything would be fine,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.880]   they reasoned.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.720]   And even Larry's ex-wife didn't like the idea of Judy,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.520]   not because she wanted to go back to Larry,
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.760]   but if Larry married Judy, the courts
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.920]   may view that as a more stable home,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   and then she would lose custody of her daughter and her son.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.040]   So she didn't like the idea of the fact
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.800]   that Judy had suddenly come into Larry's life,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   and now if Larry were to marry Judy,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.440]   then this would be a more stable relationship,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.360]   and now the courts would look with favor upon that,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.040]   and she could lose her biological children
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   to this new home.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.560]   So in spite of all the red flags and the excitement
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.880]   of their romance and believing all of the negative things
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.960]   would blow over, Larry and Judy decided to marry.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.200]   With the exception of Judy's youngest son,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.160]   both sets of children didn't want to come to the wedding.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.600]   In fact, one of Judy's daughters showed up in a black dress
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.000]   to protest the marriage.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.760]   Judy was angry and hurt, but withheld her comments
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.460]   to try to preserve the happiness of the occasion.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.760]   She tried to smooth it over with Larry by saying,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.700]   well, you know teenagers, changes
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.200]   are always hard on them.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.560]   She'll get over it soon.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   Regardless of Judy's efforts to smooth it over,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.240]   Larry did worry.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.680]   After a dreamy honeymoon on the Isle of Maui,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.560]   the newlyweds returned to a tension-filled household.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:03.160]   Both Larry and Judy were determined to make it work.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.960]   Larry found out that Judy's daughters greeted him
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.680]   with a silent treatment, and he decided
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.480]   to make the best of it by treating them kindly
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.320]   until six weeks had passed and things were only worse.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   Every time they had a problem with their homework,
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.160]   they would always go to their mother,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.920]   even they'd wait until she returned when she was gone.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.120]   And when Larry was home alone with them,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.360]   they refused his help.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.560]   So Larry was reaching the boiling point.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.840]   He found that he and Judy were arguing more and more
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.400]   about the children.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   To make matters worse, when Larry's children visited,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.760]   they didn't like Judy's cooking and would often refuse to eat.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.800]   On weekends, when they were in the home,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.160]   a turf war would break out between the two
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.960]   sets of children.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.680]   And Judy's daughters let Larry's daughter
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   know that she was not welcome in their home.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.040]   Furthermore, even though Judy's nine-year-old son enjoyed
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.880]   having Larry as his new father, he
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   resented Larry's biological son coming on weekends.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.600]   He felt that Larry favored his son
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.000]   and would leave him out of their times together.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   He looked for times to secretly remind Larry's son
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.960]   that he had his father most of the time
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.120]   seeking to drive a wedge between Larry and his son.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   It was beginning to work.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.140]   Larry noticed that his biological son
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.840]   was speaking more and more favorably
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.640]   about his ex-wife's boyfriend, all the fun times
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.060]   they were having, going to amusement parks and ball games.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.680]   This left Larry with a sinking feeling inside,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.440]   especially since this boyfriend was not a Christian
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.400]   and he refused to go to church.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   Then add to the fact that Larry's church had disciplined
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.360]   his new girlfriend for leaving Larry,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   so he was sour on Christians and church.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.600]   To make matters worse, his influence on Larry's son
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.560]   was a bad one that resulted in a bad attitude and vocabulary.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.080]   Every weekend, it seemed that Larry spent half of his time
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.640]   trying to correct the bad attitudes and behavior
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.000]   in both his daughter and his son.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.560]   From Larry's perspective, he thought
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.720]   he would see some improvements after six months of marriage,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.840]   but the opposite seemed to be true.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.080]   Instead of peace, things in the family seemed to be unraveling.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.780]   Judy noticed the same thing.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.160]   She was beginning to realize that she didn't like the way
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.200]   that Larry ran the household.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.720]   It was not the way that she and her children were used to.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.040]   They didn't like his rules.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.640]   They're rigid, inflexible.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.920]   She found herself siding with her daughters
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.000]   when they would announce, that's not the way that mom does it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.240]   Larry, too, noted that they had very different parenting
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.680]   styles and her daughters did not accept his new role
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.560]   as head of the household.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.040]   Interestingly, he discovered that if he
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   tried to exercise discipline or use
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.920]   any kind of parental authority over them,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.720]   he was overruled when they appealed to their mother.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.200]   All their dreams of having a loving Christian home
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.800]   were quickly vanishing.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.740]   After a year, so much resentment and bitterness had built up,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.840]   it was impossible to have any fun together as a family.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.520]   The tension in the home was thick.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.280]   You could cut it with a knife.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.640]   Larry was spending more and more time at the office,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.960]   and Judy and the kids seemed to be happy with that.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.120]   Their dream had turned into a horrid nightmare.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.400]   Even people at church knew something was wrong.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.480]   Judy's daughters could say nothing good
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.960]   about their stepdad.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.200]   They always referred to him with disgust as that Larry,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.840]   or not father, dad, or stepdad.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.920]   People could also see that Larry and Judy were not
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.800]   the happy Christians they used to be.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.640]   It seemed like they were dying inside.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.360]   There was no joy in their lives, just mere existence.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.120]   Their goal became a simple one.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.240]   Just make it through another day.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.920]   That was their goal.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.400]   18 months into the marriage, Larry and a close friend
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.040]   were playing golf when Larry dropped a bomb
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.320]   by announcing that he was thinking of divorcing Judy.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   She doesn't respect me.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.520]   Her daughters despise me.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.280]   My children hate her.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.240]   The only person that seems to remotely like having me around
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.880]   is her son.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   Do you know what is ironic?
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.400]   He said stoically to his golfing buddy.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.640]   After my first divorce, I was determined never
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.040]   to allow this to happen again.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.400]   I wanted to have the best Christian home possible.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.000]   I really tried, but I was overruled and frustrated
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   every turn.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.280]   I almost can't believe that I'm saying this.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.320]   Don't you love Judy?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.520]   His friend prodded.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.840]   I don't feel anything anymore.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.520]   All my emotions are gone.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   I'm cold and empty on the inside,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.640]   going about my responsibilities every day like a robot.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.000]   And I know that this is not the way the Christian life is
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   supposed to be.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.800]   Frankly, I've given up hope for this marriage.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.720]   And if I read Judy right, she has too.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.800]   I've tried everything.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.080]   But I believe we'd both be happier living apart.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.200]   At least I know her children would be.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.640]   Everything is a pretty big statement.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.600]   Have you really tried everything, his friend remarked?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.160]   Have you and Judy tried going to one
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.880]   of the pastors of our church to get some biblical answers
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.720]   for these problems?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.760]   No.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.440]   He shot back.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   I know what they'll tell me to do, pray about it
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.920]   and have devotions with the family.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.800]   Well, you know what?
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.120]   I did that, and Judy's daughters fought me
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.480]   every step of the way.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.080]   It was war every time I tried to be a spiritual leader.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.680]   Hey, give our pastors more credit than that.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.920]   There are hard issues here that need to be addressed.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.960]   And I think you need to try to get some good biblical help.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.760]   After what happened in your first marriage,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.840]   I'd hate to see you give up so easily.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.160]   Larry's friend was right.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:08.880]   So Larry and Judy sit in front of you
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.400]   for their first counseling appointment.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.880]   Tension is thick in the room.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.600]   What are you going to do?
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.080]   It's up to you.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.680]   What are you going to do?
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.280]   How are you going to handle this problem?
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.120]   Does the Bible say anything that will really
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.640]   give some substantive help to Larry and Judy?
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.880]   Or are we going to have to go on the web
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.160]   and Google in "blended families" and find some answers there
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.040]   on the web in order to try to deal
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.680]   with this particular problem?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.600]   The Bible may not be sufficient, but the world wide web is.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.840]   It has all the answers.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.440]   Regretfully, that's what a lot of Christians would do,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.880]   even Christians that believe the Bible.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.280]   They're just out there groping in darkness
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.040]   in the midst of this ocean of information
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.720]   called the world wide web for whatever
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.400]   seemingly seems practical.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.760]   When in reality, a lot of that advice
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.640]   is going to do nothing but add gasoline to a smoldering fire.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.680]   And it's going to explode into a disaster.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.120]   What do you need to do?
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.200]   Well, let's find out.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.240]   Step families need hope.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.320]   If there ever was a counseling scenario
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.480]   where hope needs to be given, it's in this kind of scenario.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   I mean, Larry's disgusted.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.680]   He's lost all hope.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.720]   He doesn't really believe that there is any possibility
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.920]   for any real change.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.400]   He sees this spiraling down deeper and deeper.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   Judy sees the same thing.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   They're not happy together anymore.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.600]   This whole home has broken down.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.880]   Step families need broad based hope.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.040]   The first order of business after you have thoroughly
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.400]   listened to the situation and you've
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.520]   gathered the appropriate data, and then later on
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.080]   between counseling sessions, you're
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.920]   going to spend a lot of time thinking through and
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.720]   interpreting that data.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   But one of the first things you can do early in counseling,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   even in the first session, is leave some time
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   to give Larry and Judy some hope.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.880]   Romans chapter 8, verses 28 and 29, 1 Corinthians 10, 13
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.800]   are very common, but very important,
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.920]   broad based promises that they need to hear.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:20.560]   There's no temptation taken you except for what is common to man
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   and God is faithful.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   He will always-- he will always, because of his faithful,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.680]   provide a way of escape.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:38.560]   And Romans 8, 28 talks about the fact that there's nothing--
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.360]   there's nothing out there in the world whatsoever
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.400]   that God hasn't ordained and he's ordained it for good.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.120]   And Romans 15, in verse 4, refers to the help
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.280]   that scripture can be when it says,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.080]   for whatever was written really in earlier times
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.240]   was written for our instruction, that through endurance
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.400]   and the encouragement of scripture, we might have hope.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:19.960]   Later on in verse 13, there is--
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.680]   of Romans 15, the apostle Paul describes God and his desires
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.280]   for the people he wrote to.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.480]   Now, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   and believing that you may abound in hope
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.800]   by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.080]   So our God is a God of hope.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.680]   And this is not a hope that contains any uncertainty
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.720]   to it.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.320]   Sometimes we use the word that way.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.480]   It is a hope that knows for sure that he
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.760]   will fulfill his promises.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.000]   The apostle Peter puts it in 1 Peter 1, 3.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.880]   "Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.840]   who, according to his great mercy,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.760]   has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.440]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.360]   There can be no greater thing that man's ever
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.080]   going to face that will overwhelm him
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.040]   with hopelessness other than death itself.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.800]   That's the great hopelessness.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.400]   And if God conquers death, and he did in Christ,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.080]   your greatest foe, then he has answers for strife even
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.160]   in the home of a step family.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:38.520]   Larry and Judy needs to have a faithful biblical counselor,
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.280]   a faithful pastor who takes the word of God seriously,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.800]   take verses like these and many more,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.360]   and minister hope to their despairing hearts.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.080]   I like what Jay Adams used to say.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   God is up to something here, and he's up to something good.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.800]   Even in this hardship, God is up to something,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.960]   and he is up to something good.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:10.440]   Well, step families also need specific hope.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.320]   Another vital aspect of hope means
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.640]   helping them to see it in the specific details
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.600]   of their situation.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.720]   And I believe one of the biggest things
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.440]   here in step family conflicts--
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.880]   now, listen to me--
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.040]   is helping them to own their own personal responsibility
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.440]   for their attitudes and actions, helping
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:48.480]   them to own their own personal responsibility
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.040]   for their attitudes and actions.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   Now, that is a very basic idea, but it
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.320]   is profound in the culture in which we live.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.440]   Because most psychologists, Christians and otherwise,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:14.320]   in their ignorance, will label this family as dysfunctional,
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.520]   which gives the impression that the unique combination
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.720]   of people in this step family with
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.840]   their distinctive personalities combine
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.920]   to form an incompatible set of relationships
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.640]   that is beyond their ability to really change.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.480]   That's what dysfunctional family means.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.240]   In other words, all the distinctive personalities
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.400]   that come together combine to form
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.160]   this incompatible set of relationships that's
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.360]   really beyond their ability to change.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.520]   Because you see, fundamentally, most psychologists
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.080]   believe that personalities are fixed.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   It's a part of your DNA.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.360]   You're hardwired that way.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.520]   You can't change.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.080]   That's just the way you are.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.640]   And so the people in a family relationship like this
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.680]   have to learn to accept the differences
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.480]   and make the best of them.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:17.600]   And so they teach them coping skills and methods or techniques
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   of interpersonal interaction in order
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.800]   to know how to deal with the distinctive personalities.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.280]   To put it in Christian terms, you
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.800]   know those fourfold animals.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.240]   There's these fourfold classification of personality.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.160]   There's the otter, the beaver, the golden retriever,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.680]   and the-- I forget that fourth one.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:54.360]   But in essence, you're an otter married to a golden retriever.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.560]   And you've got to learn how golden retrievers think
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.720]   and respond to circumstances, just as the golden retriever
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.840]   needs to learn to think how otters respond
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.980]   to circumstances.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.600]   And this is at the core and the root
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.720]   of the reasons why you're having so much problem,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.320]   is you really don't understand the distinctive personality
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   of that other person within the family.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.320]   Where do you find that in the Bible?
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.720]   You don't find any of that.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:25.680]   You have to commit the sin of semantic anachronism
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.000]   in order to make that happen.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.720]   In other words, you have to read contemporary psychobabble
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.200]   terminology back into the Bible in order
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.880]   to find anything like that in terms of personality there.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.960]   It's not there.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.600]   A natural reading of the scripture,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.760]   even in the original languages, will never
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.040]   render any of that nonsense.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.120]   The reason why people have problems,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.240]   as we've talked about before, is James 4, right?
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.760]   What is it?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.640]   Yeah, it's the battles that occur on the inside.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.920]   People want things.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.040]   They desire things.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.140]   They don't get them.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.440]   And so they fight and they quarrel
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.920]   in order to achieve them.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   It's the battles that go on the inside.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.960]   The Bible says nothing about the fact
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.720]   that, well, he's caloric and she's phlegmatic.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.880]   And the two just don't get along.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.440]   They don't understand each other's
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.080]   distinctive personalities.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.280]   And so we've got to go through a whole set of understanding
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.600]   these distinctive personalities so we can mesh better together
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.400]   in the home.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.920]   It doesn't say anything about that at all.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.920]   In fact, that just gets people way off the track
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.080]   in dealing with issues.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.520]   So the unique combination of adversarial personalities,
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.240]   they would say, are the cause of the problem.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.760]   It's like trying to make a family of pit bulls
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.280]   live in harmony with a family of poodles.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.240]   It's not going to be a pretty sight.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.680]   There's going to be a lot of blood.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:02.420]   But maybe we can help them to kind of accept one another
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.520]   and adjust to one another.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:12.240]   One publication written by Christian psychiatrists
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   and psychologists-- and it's interesting, by the way,
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   because this particular article went on
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.440]   for pages without a single reference to scripture
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.560]   in counseling blended families-- said this.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   If the parents do their job and face their issues,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.880]   the family will come through the crisis
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.280]   and work to make adjustments.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.680]   Now, that's key to their whole thinking.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.920]   Work to make adjustments that they learn through counseling
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.000]   must be made.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.640]   These adjustments include-- now, follow this--
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.880]   negotiation of roles.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.160]   That's interesting.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.960]   Negotiation of roles.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   I always thought from scripture that roles
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.480]   were fixed in the family.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.720]   Well, now we've got Mom negotiating her roles with Dad,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.340]   and Dad negotiating his roles with Mom,
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.440]   and the children negotiating their role with the parents.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.000]   So we have all this negotiation going on.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.560]   That's the first thing on the list.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.480]   Then they talk about relationship building.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.520]   OK, I could buy that relationship building.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.480]   That would be good if they mean by that edification,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.560]   but that's not what they mean by it.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.720]   When they talk about relationship building,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.080]   what they talk about is talking about making adjustments
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.000]   to other people's personalities.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.200]   Has nothing to do with edification
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.480]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.680]   Validation of family rules.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.760]   Well, that's OK.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.200]   Everybody needs to validate the family rules,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.400]   but when they talk about it, they talk about the fact
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.040]   that everybody in the family comes together and helps
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.640]   to set the rules corporately.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.360]   This is a democracy.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.160]   The Bible never set the family up to be a democracy.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.120]   That sounds so fair to us Americans,
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.640]   but it's not a democracy.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.200]   The family is a benevolent dictatorship.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.960]   That's what it is based upon scripture.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.480]   Mom and Dad lead the family, and when there's a disagreement,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.200]   Dad wins out.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.040]   That's a benevolent dictatorship.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.960]   That's the way the family was supposed to be run.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.480]   Oh, they almost have a conniption on that.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.800]   They almost go into apoplexy if you ever mention that.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.120]   So they talk about negotiation of rules,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.200]   relationship building, validation of family rules,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   traditions and customs, validation
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.400]   of the new family unit.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.240]   And again, this validation terminology.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.480]   It's not just simple.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.680]   They're not just saying acknowledging the fact
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.760]   that they're a new family.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.920]   It's not just saying it.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:01.280]   That means acknowledging the personal value and self
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.960]   worth of everybody.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.120]   It all goes back to the issue of everybody
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.040]   learning to love themselves, and at the core of this disagreement
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.080]   is the fact that a person really doesn't love themself very
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.840]   well.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.560]   And of course, one of the key words they use is adjustment.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.240]   Those families need to adjust to one another.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.440]   But not a single word is given in this article
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.760]   the personal responsibility for change
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   when it comes to interaction with other members
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.680]   of the family.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.920]   Not a single word.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.720]   Such a treatment of this problem then
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.640]   predicates the peace and harmony of the home
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.440]   when everyone making external judgments instead of really
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   seeking to change and grow, or even better,
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.640]   treating a problem this way actually undermines
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.520]   the peace and harmony of the home.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.720]   And I think that kind of counsel really
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.440]   strips step families of genuine hope.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.040]   If this family is truly dysfunctional
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.600]   due to unchangeable personalities,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.760]   then it's stuck in a hopeless quagmire of endless adjusting
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.080]   and coping.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.440]   That's what it's stuck in.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.080]   It is stuck in an endless quagmire of adjustment
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.560]   and coping, which I think amounts
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   to nothing more than the age-old heresy of asceticism.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.120]   It means, in a sense, to resign yourself to the notion
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.640]   that you just have to suffer through the indignities
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.120]   of other people in your family by practicing
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.560]   personal self-abasement and repressing
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.520]   any kind of external angry responses.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.140]   In reality, it teaches people within these families
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.760]   to be Pharisees.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.020]   You repress your angry responses.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.640]   You make coping through these coping mechanisms.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.080]   You adjust to other people and their different personalities.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:01.280]   But on the inside, there's all of this seething anger and hate
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.760]   and maliciousness that is just repressed
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.760]   for the sake of the harmony, the external harmony of the family.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.000]   Those kind of attitudes aren't biblical at all.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.120]   As Colossians 2:23 says, "These are
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.620]   matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.840]   and self-made religion and self-abasement
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.360]   and severe treatment of the body,
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.680]   but are of no value against fleshly indulgences."
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.280]   Or fleshly passions would be better.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   They have no value when it comes to fleshly passions.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.480]   All the self-abasement, self-restraint,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.760]   and externalism is never going to bring the passions
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.680]   under the control.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.800]   They are of no value.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:48.960]   Really, as biblical counselors, you
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.320]   have to address the family on the heart level.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.400]   Each member.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.240]   If the members of this family, beginning with Larry and Judy,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.840]   are willing and convinced that they can change and grow
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.920]   from the heart, then hope begins to return.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.160]   A sense of expectation and a re-energized commitment
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.040]   returns.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.760]   So by the end of your first session,
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.520]   Larry and Judy are ready to re-engage the battle
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.920]   and begin to make changes in their own lives
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.160]   that they desperately need to make.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.440]   And they do face a battle.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.480]   It's a fleshly battle.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.280]   And the battlefront is in the heart.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.600]   It's not with the other person.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.880]   It's the battlefront of their own heart.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.720]   There's a difference.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:39.920]   That's why we say, as a counselor of step-families,
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.200]   you need to view your role as that of an ideological warrior.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.860]   Take your Bible.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.480]   Let's go over to 2 Corinthians chapter 10.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.800]   I realize the immediate context of this
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.080]   does not have to do with blended family counseling.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.200]   But I think the flow and the argument of even the context
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.100]   brings to us broader theological principles that
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.440]   are applicable in blended family situations.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:18.920]   Verse 3 says, "For though we walk in the flesh,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.720]   we do not war according to the flesh.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.040]   For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.360]   but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.400]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.240]   against the knowledge of God.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.280]   And we are taking captive every thought
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.200]   or taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.840]   And we are ready to punish all disobedience whenever
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   your obedience is complete."
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.360]   Now, what is this saying?
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.240]   The term "speculations" that Paul uses here
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.280]   is that which is lifted up or higher exalted.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   It has to do with high-sounding ideas that are not
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.400]   based upon truth, but more related to man's ideas
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.840]   about life rather than God's ideas.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.160]   Man thinks he knows better about life than God knows.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.520]   This is what Proverbs 122 calls a real fool.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.720]   It's where my ideas are above the law.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.160]   They're above what God says.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.840]   I know better than God.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:35.180]   And that's an ideological issue that
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:39.360]   has to do with how the members of this particular family
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.880]   think of themselves.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.440]   Every lofty thing, and this is stated in the middle voice,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.600]   it means to lift oneself up.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.320]   It means to exalt oneself or one's own ideas
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.400]   or something that belongs to you for the purpose--
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.240]   for our purposes, we could say that many step-parents exalt
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.200]   their biological children or their family
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.760]   to a higher plane of priority than God gives them.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.120]   They have exalted ideas about themselves
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.320]   and about their families.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.000]   They have exalted ideas about themselves
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   and about their families, especially
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.600]   their biological families.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:27.640]   Paul says here in verse 4 that he
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:34.480]   is out to destroy such ideological fortresses.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.300]   He sees himself as going to war with the ministry of the Word
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.040]   to bring such a foreign enemy of thought into captivity
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.640]   and to make it obedient to Christ, verse 5.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:56.720]   Now, you see, in other words, what we're saying is this.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   Don't ever get bogged down into trying
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.400]   to help them understand personality differences.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.640]   That is just absolutely fruitless.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.360]   The bottom line is you're just going to make Pharisees out
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.000]   of your counselors.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.880]   You're going to turn them into externally behavioristic
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.380]   Christians.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:24.040]   No, you've got to address their heart.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.640]   And in addressing their heart, you've
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.120]   got to address how they think.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:34.960]   One of the first battlefronts in this war is that--
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.120]   listen to me-- most biological parents in a step-family
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:45.960]   relationship operate with a low view of marriage.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.840]   Can I say it again?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.600]   One of the first battlefronts in this war
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.560]   is that most biological parents in a step-family relationship
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.200]   operate with a low view of marriage,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.920]   even with those supposed quote, unquote,
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.440]   "strong" Christians who are having these family conflicts.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.480]   Even when you come in, and if you
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.160]   were to ask them straight out, do you
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.320]   have a low view of marriage?
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.960]   Oh, no, none of them will not.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.400]   There's not a one of them I've ever
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.040]   found that will acknowledge that I have a low view of marriage.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.880]   But when I get done, then they say, oh, yeah,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.120]   I have a low view of marriage.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.400]   So this brings us to Roman numeral number two.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:36.480]   Step-parents must be taught a high view of marriage.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.520]   This is critical.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:45.240]   Step-parents need to be taught a high view of marriage.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.040]   Now, one of the strongholds to be assaulted here,
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.000]   ideologically, by you as a counselor
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.640]   is the false doctrine held by many step-parents that
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:04.160]   basically say this, "my children come first."
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.800]   That is an assumption that they bring in because, after all,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.560]   guess what?
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.200]   Blood is thicker than water.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   And I'm not blood-related to my husband or my wife.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.000]   But I am blood-related to my children.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.160]   Or, as the culture says, and if you in the last 10,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.360]   15 years have been watching on American television,
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.920]   you've probably seen this national campaign
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   with the slogan, "children first."
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.120]   Well, that may agree with Dr. Laura.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.400]   But it doesn't agree with the Bible.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.720]   Children are not first.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.800]   And we've already learned this in this class.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.960]   Many step-parents are rooted in this cultural ideology.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.160]   My children are the most important thing.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:05.000]   And as a good soldier for Jesus Christ,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.160]   you've got to engage that wrong notion with the scripture.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.800]   The Bible teaches us from the beginning
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.440]   that your marriage takes precedence
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.960]   over your own relationship to your children.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.920]   Early in the counseling process, you've
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.720]   got to teach a high and elevated view of marriage.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.040]   Strengthening the ideological commitment
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   that both the remarried husband and the remarried wife
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.880]   have a relationship that takes priority over the children
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:40.320]   is a hard thing for them to ideologically accept.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.520]   You're going to run into a brick wall in their thinking.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   OK?
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.680]   But it's a brick wall that's worth attacking.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:58.520]   And if you, with the word of God and the Holy Spirit
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.680]   working in their heart, are able to break through this brick
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.400]   wall, you're going to see great improvement almost overnight
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.200]   in their home.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   But I've got to warn you, most of them
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.040]   believe that even though their marriage is threatened,
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   they have a high view of marriage.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.760]   And I think this goes back to Proverbs 16 in verse 2,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.520]   where Proverbs says, "A man already
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.640]   has an elevated view of himself.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.080]   He already thinks very highly of his own ideas."
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:40.360]   I have never seen a man who has an elevated view of himself
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:46.320]   say, I have never found in a step-family situation
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.800]   where the husband and wife involved,
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.240]   their concept of marriage was too high.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.440]   I've never found that.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.520]   Even with Larry and his desire to have a better
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.080]   marriage after his divorce, it's not too high.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.520]   It could always use elevating.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.480]   That's why we said in Genesis 2:24 early in this class,
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.320]   "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother."
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.680]   In other words, the husband-wife relationship
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.200]   takes priority over the parent-child relationship.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.880]   That is always true, even in a remarriage situation.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.680]   Always, always true.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:35.600]   So with that in mind, let's make eight counseling observations.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.680]   Number one, the husband-wife relationship
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.000]   is intended by God to be the permanent relationship.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.400]   Just because this is your second marriage
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.960]   does not make this any less of a marriage in God's eyes.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.360]   This is not a second-rate marriage.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.600]   Oh, there's the original marriage,
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.920]   and that was the real one in God's eyes.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.840]   This is the substitute marriage.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   No, that's wrong.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.680]   And any thoughts that come close to that are wrong.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.440]   And if you listen to this couple talk,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.320]   you'll pick this out in the language they use.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.000]   How they refer to each other, how
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.680]   they refer to the concept of marriage,
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.400]   how they refer to their children,
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.880]   their biological children, as well as their stepchildren
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.600]   in the relationship, you'll pick this up.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.960]   The husband-wife relationship is intended by God
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.240]   to be the permanent relationship.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.080]   Secondly, the parent-child relationship
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.280]   is intended by God to be a temporary relationship.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.040]   That shouldn't be any new concept to you
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.120]   so far in this course.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:49.360]   In other words, the parents have a biblical responsibility
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:56.520]   to rear their children to leave the home, not stay in the home.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:02.760]   That's the biblical responsibility,
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.880]   not stay in the home, but to leave the home.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.280]   And again, as I said before, that
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.980]   doesn't mean that you love your children
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.880]   any less than anybody else.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.360]   It just means that their relationship to you
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.240]   is temporary.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.880]   And listen, some of you get older
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.420]   and you have older children and they start leaving the home,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.600]   you realize how hard that is to let them go.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.280]   Here you have daughters that you have reared up and vested
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.440]   your life into.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.040]   And you feel like on the wedding day
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.520]   you're turning a Stradivarius into the hands of a baboon.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:52.040]   So you feel like you're turning this wonderful instrument that
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.080]   can be used by God to create beautiful music
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.680]   and you're giving it to an ape.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.880]   All right?
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   Now in case my son-in-laws watch this video,
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.720]   I really don't believe you're an ape.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   But I'm saying that's what parents feel.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   That's what they feel.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.640]   So it's hard to let them go.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:26.480]   It's hard for these step-parents to say
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.560]   that their relationship to each other
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.000]   takes precedence over those biological children who maybe
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.920]   they have spent years with those biological children
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   and their relationship with this new spouse
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.360]   is only a few months old.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.080]   That's hard.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.880]   That is really hard to do.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:53.240]   To say, I'm sorry, but my husband comes first, not you.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.520]   Those biological children are going to stand there
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.240]   and they're going to have eyes the size of watermelon.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.160]   What are you talking about?
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:11.800]   Thirdly, your biological children and stepchildren
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.520]   must be reared to leave the home, not stay.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.600]   And this is really hard.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.800]   It's especially hard for step-parents.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.240]   And let me explain why.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.440]   We're going to get into this in the next section.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:34.000]   But especially if you have a, like in Judy's situation,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.880]   where she had a husband previously eight years before.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.200]   And they had a good relationship.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.040]   And he passed away.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.760]   He died.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.440]   And now her only relationship now
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.800]   has been with those children.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   In other words, she really loved her relationship
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.840]   with her former husband.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.520]   And by God's sovereign purposes, this
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.040]   is a Deuteronomy 29, 29 issue.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.200]   By God's sovereign purposes, he has taken her husband away.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.760]   Then her tendency now is to replace all that loneliness
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.880]   that she feels, is to put her children
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.320]   in the place of her husband.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.440]   So now she grows very, very close to her children.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.240]   And she also has a heart for her children.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.560]   After all, her children have lost their dad.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.440]   And so that just draws her close.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.240]   Her mother's heart is dying on the inside.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.160]   And now for her to go into this new relationship with Larry
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.000]   and have this relationship with him,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.480]   and now to set him above her children
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.680]   is one of the hardest things in her life to do.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.160]   That is really tough.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:43.640]   Everything in her flesh is saying no to this.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.360]   Fourth, your example of setting their stepfather or stepmother
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   ahead of them as children is the model
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.640]   they need to see for their own future marriage.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.440]   It's a model they need to see.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.120]   In creation, in Paul's description
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.600]   of the Christian home, in the qualification of the elders
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.240]   in 1 Timothy 3, the priority is always
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.880]   given to the husband and wife relationship first.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.760]   And the children are always listed second.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.640]   The children are never put on the list first.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:37.880]   It may hurt Judy to set Larry above her children,
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.880]   but this is exactly what her children needs to see
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.560]   before they leave the home.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.920]   Her daughters, her son, needs to see this.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.440]   This is the model she needs to set,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.880]   which basically she's saying to them, when you leave the home,
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.000]   you need to go out and do the same thing in your home.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.160]   That's what should happen.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:11.840]   So your example of setting their stepfather and stepmother
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.280]   ahead of them as children is the model they need to see.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.360]   This is tough.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.380]   I'm telling you, this kind of counseling,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:25.160]   you're climbing straight uphill, and you've got lead boots on.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.480]   This is hard.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:39.840]   Just a few weeks ago, I was in Colorado Springs,
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   right in the shadows of a prominent Christian ministry.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.640]   And I did a blended family conference.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.800]   And several of the families that were there
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.880]   were heavily influenced by that particular ministry.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.460]   And we talked about these very principles.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:01.440]   And during the break sessions, I was barraged with people
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.960]   who said, I have never heard anybody say this before.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.640]   I said, well, the key is not whether or not I'm saying it.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.220]   The key is whether or not this is what
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.740]   you see the word of God saying.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.360]   If this is what the word of God says,
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.480]   then you better believe it.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.360]   This is what God says.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.060]   Fifth, marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.700]   You know, I've actually had husbands, a wife,
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.500]   in counseling say that and repeat that three or four times
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.460]   for me.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.700]   Marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.820]   All right, I say to Larry.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.220]   OK, Larry, listen to me now.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.180]   We're done with our counseling session today.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.740]   And they're going to interview Larry.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.900]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.980]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.060]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.140]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.140]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.180]   He's going to talk to you.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.640]   And they're going to interview Larry as soon as you step out
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.140]   the door.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.180]   And one of the interviewers of Channel 7 News
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.580]   is going to stick a mic in your face and say to you,
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.260]   Larry, what's the most important thing you got out
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.460]   of this counseling session?
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.260]   What are you going to say to them, Larry?
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.620]   Larry looks at me and goes, marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.900]   That's it, Larry.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.340]   You got it.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.420]   Marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.380]   You may be blood related to your children,
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.620]   but your commitment to them is temporary.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:19.460]   However, even though you are not blood related to your spouse,
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.260]   your commitment is for a lifetime.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:28.860]   Marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.660]   Yeah, blood's thicker than water.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.120]   But marriage is thicker than blood.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:41.980]   Number six, the powerful and natural parental compulsion
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.340]   to love their children must be surrendered
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.460]   to the higher priority of being a godly mate and loving spouse.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:54.140]   And I want you to feel that.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:55:03.380]   This powerful and very natural compulsion to love children
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:07.300]   has to be surrendered to the higher priority of loving
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:12.940]   a godly mate and spouse, or being a godly mate and loving
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:13.440]   spouse.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.200]   That's got to be the priority.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:26.080]   In other words, what you naturally feel
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.420]   is not what God wants you to do.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:32.540]   Can I say it again?
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.580]   What you naturally feel is not what God wants you to do.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:48.340]   Because everything inside of you
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.060]   is going to be screaming at you, this is wrong.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:56:04.420]   Number seven, a child-centered home,
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.700]   whether it is the first or second marriage,
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.180]   will always experience trouble because the children will
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.300]   eventually grow up and leave.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.460]   That leaves you as a couple with a relationship in shambles.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.260]   Little or no investment time or energy
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.380]   has been given to it over the years.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.220]   So as a result, when the children really finally
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:26.640]   do leave the home, mom and dad split as well.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.700]   And this is one of the reasons why, statistically, I
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:35.020]   think the world says, and it's true,
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.860]   if you can believe some of the ways in which they compile
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:41.660]   these statistics, that second marriages statistically
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:45.500]   last or end a lot sooner than first marriages.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:51.680]   And this is one of the reasons.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.380]   Even if they survive, the children growing up,
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.020]   then they eventually divorce once the children are gone.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:00.820]   Because they've turned that home into a child-centered home.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:15.220]   Last and finally, fashion your seat belts
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.980]   and put your crash helmets on.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.580]   Number eight, the fleshly, sinful passions and desires
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.180]   of your biological children.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.940]   Proverbs 22.15, "A foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child."
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.820]   Will always pit you as a biological parent
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.660]   against their step-parent, your spouse,
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.780]   if you allow your home to be child-centered.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.420]   Now follow that thought.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.840]   They will prey on your parental affections
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.780]   and use them to drive a wedge between you
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.820]   and your spouse for their own self-centered purposes.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.780]   When you allow yourself to be manipulated,
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.420]   you are pandering their sinful nature.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.340]   And in this way, you're hurting both your marriage
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.140]   and your children.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:10.780]   See, it is the sinful nature of a child
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.620]   to prey on the parent's affections.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.100]   Children become manipulative in this way.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.740]   And they will actually say to Judy--
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:25.900]   her children will say to her, you don't love me.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.980]   You're actually choosing that Larry over me.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:36.460]   Yes, she is, but that does not mean she does not love them.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.020]   In fact, from a biblical perspective,
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:43.020]   she's actually loving them better
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.740]   because she's setting up a model that they need
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.180]   to see for their future home.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:55.980]   So you're allowing yourself as a step-parent
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:01.740]   to be manipulated when you pander their sinful nature.
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:06.060]   And you cater to their manipulative ways.
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.460]   You're allowing yourself-- you're
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:11.020]   sowing seeds of your home's destruction
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.560]   when you're doing that kind of thing.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:22.520]   And that will destroy your home.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:34.440]   Children and their sinful desires
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:46.600]   will wreak havoc in the heart of a mother or father who
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.360]   feels bad about their kids.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.240]   After all, their father or their mother died,
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:57.080]   or they experienced the horrible events of this divorce.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.960]   When you cater to that, you are sowing seeds of destruction
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.760]   for your home.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.520]   And it will undermine that home.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:23.760]   As Proverbs chapter 14 and verse 1 says,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   "The wise woman builds her house,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.520]   but the foolish tears it down with her own hands."
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:39.120]   And I believe that one of the ways that a step-parent wife
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.000]   can tear her home down is by allowing her heart to be
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.640]   manipulated by her biological children.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:54.560]   The genuine Christian home rejects the notion--
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.720]   my children come first.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.400]   God is always first.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.080]   But before the children, the spouse
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.920]   has to be your first human priority.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.240]   That's the foundational concept.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:14.120]   That is the first battle and war you have to fight in this home.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.160]   Because whether or not-- if you don't win this war,
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.200]   then everything else from this particular point
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.980]   on in dealing with step-parent counseling
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.680]   is going to be superfluous.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.460]   It is not going to be valuable.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.920]   You're not going to make a whole lot of progress.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.960]   You have to win this war, and you
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.720]   have to win this war early in their minds and their thinking.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:46.280]   All right, questions at this point so far?
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.440]   We have more to cover.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.440]   Yes, Rebecca.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.900]   I have a couple of questions later.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.880]   But what if they have a good marriage and stuff,
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.860]   but the father-- the father's coming in,
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.360]   and the woman has daughters or sons or whatever.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.360]   And they both agree on punishments and stuff.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.840]   Should he go ahead and completely assert it?
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.320]   Or should he allow her to want the agreed rules
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.300]   that they've done?
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   And he eventually becomes that.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.560]   I want you to save your question.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.800]   I think it's going to be answered in the next session
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.640]   that we deal-- next section here.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.140]   But if I don't answer it completely
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.760]   on what you're asking, then bring it back up again.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.360]   Because I think we'll cover that.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.120]   David.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.320]   What's the best political verse for rejecting children first?
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.200]   For rejecting children first?
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.960]   Yeah, the idea of children first.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.200]   Oh, Genesis 224.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.720]   What God has intended, the standard for marriage
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.360]   is right there.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.480]   A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.680]   There's a lot in that statement.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.120]   That's what God has intended from the very beginning.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.680]   And remember, when we went through that, I said,
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.000]   Adam didn't even have parents at this point.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.600]   So in stating that, God was stating a universal axiom
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.520]   that all of his people should follow,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   the way he intended life to function.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.100]   Timur.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.400]   Are you having a chance to teach these things
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.080]   in the premarital counseling for those families?
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.360]   Yes.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.040]   The question is, does this come up?
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.360]   Do you bring these issues up in premarital counseling?
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.080]   Absolutely.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.800]   With stepfamily, remarried situations,
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.680]   especially where biological children are involved, oh yes,
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.920]   you've got to bring this up in that kind of counseling.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.160]   In fact, it's really funny.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.000]   These are the very homes that, because they maybe
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.880]   had a prior Christian home where a spouse died,
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.640]   they will try to get around.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.080]   They really don't think they need premarital counseling.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.520]   And they're the very homes.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.280]   They're usually older adults.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.320]   They're the very homes that need it the most.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.040]   But this is the home that somehow doesn't
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.160]   think they really need it.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.120]   We're both Christians.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.680]   We're more mature than we were.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.880]   After all, we're not two teenagers getting married,
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.960]   da-da-da-da-da-da.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.600]   We don't need premarital counseling.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.560]   Oh my goodness.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.840]   It is that prideful assumption that
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.340]   is going to lay the foundation for the destruction
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.000]   of that marriage.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.960]   So there's the conclusion.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.680]   Genuine Christian home rejects the notion
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680]   my children come first.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.720]   God always comes first.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.440]   But before the children, the spouse
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.520]   must be the first human priority.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.020]   John.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.800]   I'm just curious if there's any reason why Larry's divorce is
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.960]   not mentioned.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.560]   Obviously, it seems like there is a pattern that's
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.740]   going on here with his lack of spiritual leadership
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.080]   in the family.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.280]   What do you mean by Larry's divorce is not mentioned?
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.080]   What do you mean by that?
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.240]   Well, he says he's divorced.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.140]   Why is he-- why he got divorced?
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.000]   Well, she left him.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:13.700]   She left him.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.180]   Yeah, she left him and ran off with a boyfriend.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.540]   And the church disciplined her.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.140]   All right?
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.220]   Yeah, disciplined her out of the church.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.580]   And she had no desire to return.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.260]   And so when the church disciplined her,
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.580]   that declared her to be an unbeliever.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.300]   And then Larry then has the option to divorce her
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.340]   if she doesn't repent.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.300]   Right, but it still doesn't negate the fact
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.900]   that there was probably some sin involved that involved her.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.920]   You know, or what did--
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.360]   You mean his sin, you mean?
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.040]   His sin.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.520]   In contributing to--
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.400]   oh, yeah, I'm sure that that's the case.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.200]   We don't go into that detail because right now, that
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:59.620]   is not as significant at this point in our discussion
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:05.160]   for what we want to highlight in the Splendid Family Counseling.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.080]   All right, good.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.360]   All right, we will take about a 15-minute break,
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.760]   and we'll come back and hit the next section here.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:17.560]   All right, good.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:27.680]   Let's see if we can get started now with part two here,
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.200]   the step-parent trap.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:34.000]   All right, in the first session that we had together,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.600]   we learned that the children are to be
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.080]   reared to think of themselves as second on the priority
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.880]   list in that family.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.920]   No exception is made in a step-parenting home.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.400]   Even though your spouse may not be the biological parent,
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.240]   they still are to be viewed with the same priority and authority
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.760]   as the biological parent.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.360]   Why?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.160]   Listen to this.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:01.360]   Because your priority in the home determines your authority.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.240]   Your priority in the home determines your authority.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.080]   If you put your children before your mate,
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.560]   then your children will use it against you
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.240]   and ruin the model of marriage that God intends them to have.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.880]   If you do not treat your mate with equal priority
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.120]   to your own role, your children will not
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.920]   treat them with equal authority.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:29.480]   There must be-- listen.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.360]   There must be no daylight between you
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.400]   and your children's step-parent.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.680]   They must view you as one, even though that
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.760]   may be repulsive to them at the beginning.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.240]   They'll adjust to it.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.960]   This is not going to wound their little psyches to do this.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.080]   It's not going to do that.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:59.360]   The only exception would be if clear issues of biblical
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.320]   morality are at stake, or your new spouse
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.600]   is a physical danger to your children.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.920]   And we'll talk about abuse later on.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.680]   But what are we dealing with?
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.440]   There are a variety in scripture.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   There are a variety of different types of step-families.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.520]   And we're not going to take time to go into all of these.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.360]   But if you were to take a look in Genesis chapter 4
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   and verse 19, there's the polygamous type.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.320]   Then there is the adulterous type.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.440]   In Genesis 16, 3 and 21, 9 through 11.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   Deuteronomy 21, 15 through 17.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.000]   There's a second type of polygamous form
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.960]   of step-families in Genesis 29, 31 through 35.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.080]   And then there's the death of a spouse type
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.760]   in 2 Corinthians 12, 9, 13, 1, 28, and 29.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:00.200]   These are all different kinds of step-families in scripture.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.040]   The scripture really deals with this.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:11.000]   Because in a lot of these, the same kind of pressure points
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   in situations that we see today in contemporary step-family
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.560]   relationships, you can see in a lot
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:27.680]   of the polygamous relationships of the Old Testament.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.960]   And boy, there are just a variety of wicked things.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.560]   More prominently, probably, you could
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.880]   see this in David's own home.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.160]   And the stress and the problems that
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:47.280]   occurred between the half sisters and brothers of David
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.400]   with his various wives are the same kind of pressures
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.440]   that you can see in contemporary step-family relationships.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:04.480]   With this in mind, children are to be
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.360]   reared to think of themselves as second on the priority list.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:15.200]   Priority in the home determines your authority.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.920]   So it's vitally important that, as parents,
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   you present a united front.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.240]   It's vitally important that, as parents,
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.360]   you present a united front.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.400]   That's where we say the children must not
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.960]   see a speck of daylight between you
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.520]   and your spouse in a step-family relationship.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.120]   When you act and when you make decisions,
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.640]   you act and you make decisions as one.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.920]   At the end of the last session, I mentioned, as my last point,
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.480]   the fleshly or sinful passions that children are born with.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.760]   And the Bible tells us that a child, because
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.640]   of his sinful nature, is already well-disposed of himself.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:07.800]   Contrary to Alfred Adler and Karen Horney and Abraham Maslow,
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   and the rest of the Impressionistic child
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.480]   psychologists, in contrast to that, who believe that children
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.720]   are born with an inferiority complex that
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.760]   is fixed by the age of six, the Bible
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.000]   says that a child is born with an intense self-love
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.600]   that it looks out for itself naturally all the time.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.160]   That's his or her depraved nature.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:40.000]   So we would say this, that stepchildren are sinners, too.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.200]   Proverbs 22.15, "Foolishness is bound up
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.400]   in the heart of a child."
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:56.040]   And you've heard me talking about this in the past, where
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.840]   in dealing with a young lady who came in for counseling,
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.880]   who came in for counseling here at the college
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.200]   because she had low self-esteem.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.600]   And I talked with her about the fact
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.520]   that it really didn't make a whole lot of sense
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.060]   that she was saying that, because she
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.520]   was miserable and depressed.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.520]   If she really had true low self-esteem,
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.200]   then she'd be saying, with all the difficulties
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.120]   and hardships that she was facing in life,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.680]   she'd be saying, I really don't care about them.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.520]   I'm not really depressed or discouraged, because after all,
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.120]   I think low of myself to begin with,
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.000]   so all these hardships are just naturally what I expect.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.760]   The very fact that she was miserable and depressed
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.440]   demonstrates that she already has a lot of high self-esteem
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   anyhow.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.000]   And I was watching that same young lady, just an hour later,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.200]   standing in the cafeteria line, rifling
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.160]   through the cherry tomatoes at the salad bar.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:12:59.960]   What was she doing?
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.920]   And she rifled through those cherry tomatoes.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.040]   Was she looking for the worst cherry tomatoes
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.960]   in the entire bunch to put on her salad
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.920]   because she thought low of herself?
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.800]   No, she wasn't.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.400]   She was standing there rifling through those cherry tomatoes
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.320]   to find the best ones of the bunch to put on her salad.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:19.880]   Why?
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.080]   Because that's our default nature.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.000]   Our default nature, and a child's default nature,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.240]   is always to think well of themselves.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.440]   And so they look out for themselves naturally.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.720]   That's the default nature of everyone.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.200]   So the biblical description of a child is this way.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:48.600]   Everyone wants to be sure they have the best.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.500]   People always look out for themselves,
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.400]   and stepchildren are no different.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:03.440]   And in fact, they tend to even be
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.360]   more at the mercy of their own desires
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.560]   because of the circumstances that
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.720]   have occurred in their life.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:15.060]   Now let's take a look at the biblical description of a child.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.560]   If you have your Bible and you want to draw this close,
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:26.560]   go over to Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 11.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.760]   Let's do a little bit of biblical mathematics
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.480]   and add up how the Bible views a child.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.440]   The Bible makes no distinction on whether these children
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:47.040]   are stepchildren, half brothers or sisters, adopted children.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.040]   It makes no distinction.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.760]   It just says all children are this way.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:58.400]   Chapter 20 and verse 11 says it is by his deed
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.000]   that a lad distinguishes himself if his conduct is
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.840]   pure and right.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.240]   So in essence, Proverbs says in chapter 20 verse 11
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.440]   that a child becomes known by his actions,
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.160]   either proper or improper action,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.560]   the behavior of that child, whether it
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.440]   be by external deeds or attitudinal behavior,
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.000]   characterizes that child's life.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.600]   You've heard people say, oh my goodness,
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.800]   that child's always caustic.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.760]   Or you'll hear people say, every time I've ever
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.080]   seen that child, that child is always happy.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.240]   So a child becomes known by his actions,
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.880]   whether they're proper or improper.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.140]   Then we've already reviewed Proverbs 22.6,
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.880]   train up a child in the way he should go,
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.840]   and when he is old he will not depart from it.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.040]   And we've said that that's not a promise, it's a warning.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.480]   In other words, you train up a child in such a way
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.560]   that he walks his own way.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.360]   When he is old, he'll not stop walking his own way.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.140]   Now that's an important characteristic of a child.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.540]   If you let a child be at the mercy of his or her own
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.340]   passions while they're growing up,
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.980]   and you don't call them into check when they grow old,
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.700]   they'll not stop that.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.540]   And I think we used as an illustration 1 Kings chapter 1
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.340]   Adonijah, didn't we?
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:42.980]   And we talked about how David violated this.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.340]   And I think it's interesting how Solomon, David's own son,
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.660]   writes in Proverbs 22.6.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.900]   Because his own step-brother, so to speak, or half-brother,
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:17:00.600]   Adonijah, who was the son of Hagath, that was his mother,
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.540]   exalted himself.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.160]   I mean, no wonder this kid was this way,
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.740]   to have a mother by the name of Hagath.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:15.340]   But this son says, I will be king.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.460]   And so he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.180]   with 50 men to run before him.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:22.660]   And his father had never crossed him at any time.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.140]   And the Hebrew says, his father had never pained him,
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.380]   never brought pain into his life by asking, what have you done,
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.100]   or why have you done so?
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.720]   He never questioned him about anything.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.180]   He let him do his own thing.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.300]   And so that's a hands-off type of parenting.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:43.260]   And so as a result of that, you train up a child in such a way
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.740]   where you have a hands-off role on that child.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.100]   And when he grows old, he won't stop being that way.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.980]   He'll be at the mercy of his own passions.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:54.940]   And then 22.15 then says, a folly
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.740]   is bound up in the heart of a child.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.940]   It's the rod of discipline to drive it far from him.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.320]   I mean, he's not naturally wise.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:07.960]   It's possible for children to be smart, even better
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.800]   than their siblings, or even better
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.520]   than other kids at their age.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.880]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that a child is wise.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.640]   There's a difference biblically.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.200]   And it's significant later on in life.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.280]   He's not wise and will choose the things
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.800]   on the basis of immediate gratification and satisfaction.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.920]   And then 23.13 says, parents are warned not to leave
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.800]   a child without discipline.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.080]   And then 29.15, a child left to himself
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.640]   will disgrace his mother.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   So if you were to sum up all that Proverbs
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.220]   has to say about a child, we could
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.920]   say that a child's judgment cannot be trusted.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.240]   A child is foolhardy, tends to be undisciplined,
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   and if left without correction, will go astray and disgrace
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.260]   his parents.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.960]   Boy, that is not what the behaviorists say.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.560]   The behaviorists say a child is basically born neutral.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.040]   And you bring him up in the right kind of environment,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.080]   and he'll turn out right.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:15.120]   We can assume that a child left to himself,
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.480]   contrary to what Piaget says in terms of all
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.040]   of his self-discovery of truth, contrary to Piaget,
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.080]   a child left to himself grows up at the mercy of his own passions
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.040]   and urges.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.520]   And he or she will follow those passions and urges
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.320]   as long as there's no external restraint
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.920]   or until the heart changes and they grow up
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.160]   in spiritual maturity.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:46.100]   When a stepchild says, you're not my parent,
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.960]   it is a child's way of manipulating the situation
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.320]   for their own ends.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.800]   You get me?
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.120]   When a stepchild says, you're not my parent,
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.760]   it is that stepchild's way of manipulating
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.840]   the situation for his own ends.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.080]   All right.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.960]   So a child's judgment cannot be trusted.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:19.000]   This child who's left to himself will disgrace his parents.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.360]   He grows up living at the mercy of his own passions and urges.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.720]   And he or she will follow those passions and urges
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.480]   as long as there is no external restraint
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.560]   or until their heart changes and they grow up
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.440]   in spiritual maturity.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.960]   So when they make those statements,
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.240]   you're not my parent, that's supposed
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.400]   to put off a step-parent.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.480]   It's intended to cause the step-parent to back up and say,
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.320]   oh, you're right.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.440]   I'm really not the parent.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.600]   That child is manipulating a situation.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:58.560]   The step-parent needs to respond in love to that situation
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.800]   and say, you may not think I'm your parent, but I do love you.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.760]   And God has placed me here as a parent in your home
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.800]   at this particular time.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.960]   And I am your parent.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.520]   I may not be your biological parent.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.840]   You have a biological father or mother.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.320]   And I may not be that person.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.520]   But still, in terms of authority in your life,
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   I'm your parent.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.720]   They may not like that.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:30.920]   A child may stomp and scream and do whatever.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.520]   But that doesn't change the fact that in God's eyes
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:44.640]   that step-parent is still in that home for a godly purpose,
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.400]   to bring some kind of authority or structure into that home.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:55.080]   You take a look at Psalms 51 and verse 5.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.040]   "Behold," David says, "I was brought forth in iniquity
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:58.800]   and in sin.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.280]   My mother conceived me."
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:07.200]   Psalm 53, verses 2 and 3, "God has looked down from heaven
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.680]   upon the sons of man to see if there
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.400]   is anyone who understands or seeks after him.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.040]   Every one of them has turned aside.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.480]   Together they have become corrupt."
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.920]   Psalm 58, verse 3, "The wicked are estranged from the womb.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.320]   These who speak lies go astray from birth."
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.960]   So children are not the innocent creatures
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.120]   we make them out to be.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.560]   From birth, God says, they begin their wickedness.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:43.160]   Paul on children, what does Paul say?
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.400]   1 Corinthians 13, 12, "When I was a child,
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   I used to speak as a child, think as a child,
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.880]   reason as a child.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.080]   When I became a man, I did away with childish things."
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.680]   Now, to speak as a child is to say things without thinking.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.240]   You ever seen kids talk?
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240]   They just say things.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.920]   Whatever comes to their minds is what they say.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.040]   Wow, you're stupid.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.040]   All right?
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.120]   They'll just say things.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:19.200]   You heard about the family who invited the pastor over
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.520]   to their home one day to have a meal on a Sunday afternoon.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.100]   And so in order to impress the pastor,
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.600]   the mother asked the young boy to return thanks for the meal.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.480]   And the young boy didn't want to do it.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.760]   And so the mother tried to encourage him and says,
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.920]   well, sweetheart, go ahead and pray.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.600]   The pastor would like it if you'd pray.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.560]   He says, well, mom, I don't know what to say.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.080]   And she says, well, just say what I say.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:52.240]   So the little boy bowed his head and said, dear Lord,
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.080]   we're happy to have the pastor here,
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.040]   but we hope he goes home soon.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.360]   That's what a kid will do.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:10.320]   To speak as a child is to speak without thinking.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.320]   To think as a child is to think in selfish ways.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.840]   To reason like a child is to make decisions
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.240]   based upon what is most beneficial at the moment.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.880]   That's reasoning.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.160]   There's really no logic except for whatever
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.920]   pleases me the most at this given moment.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.040]   If you say to a child, I'll tell you what,
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.520]   I'm going to give you $100 right now.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:52.880]   If you stop teasing your sister, but if you're
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:25:00.800]   able to do this for six weeks, I'll give you $100,000.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.520]   99% of young children are going to take the $100 right now.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.680]   As an adult, we say, all they got to do is wait six weeks.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.560]   They'll get $100,000.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.480]   But a child's going to take that which is pleasurable
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.360]   at that given moment.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.480]   What can I do with $100?
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.120]   Well, I could buy a Nintendo.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.040]   I could get all the candy I ever wanted and get sick on it.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:34.440]   And then Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 14
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.640]   says, as a result, we are no longer children tossed here
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.560]   and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.600]   by the trickery of men, by craftiness
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.240]   and deceitful scheming.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.760]   Now, what's that say?
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.200]   The biblical description of a child
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.800]   is that children are gullible.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.120]   And they're easily led astray and deceived
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.240]   because of their foolishness and selfish ways.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.080]   And deceitful people know that, and they
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.840]   will appeal to the children in their flesh.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:08.280]   I mean, in our culture today, our children
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.440]   don't have hope because they're so gullible and so
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.880]   tied into their selfish ways.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.520]   And they've got men out there paid millions of dollars
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.000]   every year to entice them to buy stuff they don't need.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   So deceitful men know how to appeal to their flesh.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.920]   They can be taught to believe anything
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.800]   if it appeals to their passion and caters to their flesh
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.920]   right at that given moment.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:37.320]   Think about how the scripture defines a child.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:44.280]   Let me illustrate a child's basic nature.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.680]   Have you ever heard of the 10 property laws of toddlers?
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.200]   If I like it, it's mine.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.440]   If it's in my hand, it's mine.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.320]   If I can take it from you, it's mine.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.960]   If I had it a little while ago, it should be.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.400]   It's mine.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.040]   If it's mine, it must never appear to be yours in any way.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.760]   If I'm building something, all the pieces are mine.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.480]   If it looks just like mine, it's mine.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.400]   If I saw it first, it's mine.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.680]   If you're playing with something and you put it down,
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.080]   it automatically becomes mine.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.560]   If it's broken, it's yours.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.520]   That's the 10 property laws of toddlers.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.600]   That's the way the toddler thinks.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.120]   Now, how could anybody ever look at that
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.520]   and say that the basic nature of a child isn't selfish?
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   There's a lot of adults that think that way, too.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.800]   That's exactly right.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.960]   When you have children with that kind of an attitude
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.600]   in a stepfamily environment with all the unique struggles
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.760]   and temptations, you have a cauldron of trouble brewing.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.960]   All right?
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.680]   That's what you have.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.200]   All right.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.920]   What about child psychology and step-parenting confusion?
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.400]   What about that?
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.640]   Well, in contrast to the biblical description
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.040]   of the nature of a child is the psychologized assumption
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.160]   that most biological parents adopt in reference
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.320]   to their children, especially when they and their children
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.040]   have been through a messy divorce
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.920]   and battled over child custody.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.000]   Impressionistic child psychology has taught our culture
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.080]   and Christians well.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.520]   Our culture tends to view the children as essentially
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:24.720]   good, innocent little people with highly impressionable
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.040]   psyches.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.360]   Crisis events like the loss of a parent
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.120]   through death or emotional fights between a mother
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.760]   and father and nasty divorce, a lengthy child custody
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.840]   fight in the courts damage their innocent psyches
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.680]   and tear away at parent's heart.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680]   So given the bad events of the past, which
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.440]   might include the horrible mess of a divorce,
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.800]   and assuming the children have had enough negative things
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.440]   occur, biological mom--
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.600]   she's the one who usually becomes the custodial parent--
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.480]   begins to view the children as helpless victims who
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   are emotionally scarred.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.440]   And with that kind of view of children,
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.800]   no wonder that Christian parents buy
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.720]   into the nonsense that's presented
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.920]   them in Christian psychology.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.120]   It basically says, seek out a therapist
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.280]   who specializes in blended family issues.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:31.200]   That's what one encyclopedia of Christian psychology says.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.800]   And the therapist doesn't even have to be a Christian.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.520]   Why, because the therapist is going
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.440]   to help the children deal with these wounded psyches, which
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.040]   is the all-important thing for them.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:52.460]   So the natural heart of the mother
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:54.880]   will want to buy into the image of her children
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:59.000]   being helpless victims of terrible circumstances.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.800]   And so she proceeds to compensate for it
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.680]   in her attitude as well as her approach
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.420]   to discipline of her children.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:12.400]   And on top of all of that enters into the mixed a new stepfather
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.280]   who wants to be a good father, wishes
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.640]   to help his new wife rear the children properly.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.120]   But by contrast, a mom's approach
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.320]   to household discipline, which is pretty lenient,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320]   this new authority figure in their life
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.520]   appears to be Attila the Hun.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.640]   I mean, this guy is a drill sergeant,
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.440]   even though he doesn't try to be.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:42.440]   This is what happened in Larry and Judy's home.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:48.200]   Judy began to realize she didn't like the way in which Larry
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.480]   ran the household, especially the way
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.840]   that he dealt with her children.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.480]   Well, let me go back there for a minute.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:04.400]   He appeared rigid to her, inflexible.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.280]   She sided with her daughters frequently
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.700]   when a question of discipline came up.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.280]   And after seeing all the negative stuff
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.400]   her children had gone through and losing her father
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.760]   and mother's-- her mother's heart ached for them.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.320]   And to see Larry come into their new home
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.040]   and expect of her daughters things
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.560]   that she didn't expect of them was more
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.040]   than she could really take.
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.600]   So Judy found herself countering most of Larry's things,
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.120]   expectations of her children.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.440]   And consequently, Larry was hearing things
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.000]   from her children like, that's not the way mom does it.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.420]   You're not my father.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:40.840]   And my father would have never done it that way.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.360]   And my mom, when she gets home, she's
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.080]   going to change what you've done.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:51.920]   In fact, Larry thought Judy's daughters had almost
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.080]   elevated their biological dad to the level of sainthood
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.080]   now that he was in heaven.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.040]   It's tough to live in the shadow of a saint,
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.600]   especially one that could never do any wrong.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.480]   Scripture warns us not to live in the past.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.680]   It's wrong to dream about bygone days
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.520]   and to cultivate an unrealistic nostalgia.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.160]   Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10,
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.480]   "Do not say, why is it that the former days are
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.360]   better than these?
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.800]   For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this."
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.600]   Well, another way of putting it is,
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.220]   you're a fool if you live with unrealistic images
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.720]   of past events.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.220]   Why?
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:35.680]   Because human memory is notoriously self-serving.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.440]   You and I tend to remember things
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.680]   in very self-favoring ways.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.740]   That's exactly what Judy's daughters were doing.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.600]   The point of Ecclesiastes 7 and verse 14
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.320]   is that in the day of prosperity, be happy.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:52.000]   But in the day of adversity, consider God
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.600]   has made the one as well as the other.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:00.720]   And since God made the bad day as well as the good day,
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:03.880]   it must always be for our good.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.480]   And Judy's daughters have elevated
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.920]   their biological father to this unrealistic level,
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:11.520]   and Judy had allowed it to happen.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.080]   Children are not emotionally helpless victims.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.880]   They may be victims of sinful people, or physical abuse,
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.800]   or bad circumstances.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.960]   But how they choose to deal with such things is their choice.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.480]   And God made both the good and the bad times.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.320]   They, in turn, are not helpless.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.440]   They are human choice makers with selfish desires
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.280]   that swirl in this cauldron around them
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.340]   like powerful currents affecting the type of person
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:45.040]   that they are going to become once their choices are made.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.320]   Often, children in remarried families
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.600]   will choose to view their past family life
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.400]   with idealized memories.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.920]   This is something you have to address as a counselor.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.120]   They're living in a make-believe world
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.960]   and refusing to accept reality.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:09.260]   And those memories are colored in self-favoring ways.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:12.000]   They enjoy the role of a pitiful, helpless victim,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.680]   and they will use it because of their depravity
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.000]   for their own sinful ends.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.280]   They forget the tough times in the past.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.640]   They forget that.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.040]   They don't remember the decisions
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.880]   and the actions of their biological father or mother
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.760]   that they just as vehemently disagreed with.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.600]   In their sinful recounting of these memories,
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.320]   they'll leave out all the bad memories
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.480]   when they want to manipulate their step-parent.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.900]   They would have everybody believe
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:40.360]   that their biological parent that's no longer with them
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.760]   made no mistakes or would never have
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.840]   had such unreasonable expectations of them.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.760]   John.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.280]   Just with children and authority in general,
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.840]   there's a natural bent for them to reject it.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:58.140]   I recall as a child with the babysitter coming over,
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.320]   saying the exact same thing.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.280]   You're not my mom.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.540]   I don't have to listen to you.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.040]   Yes.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040]   The same thing with the school teacher.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.200]   Babysitters, yep.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.160]   You're not my mom.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.880]   I don't have to listen to you.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.480]   So I guess my question is, it's not so much just
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.520]   with parent and step-parent as much as--
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.000]   Right.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.880]   Teaching your child equitably at all levels of authority.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:20.960]   Is that true?
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.880]   But I think in the step-parent family relationship,
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.200]   because of the biological bond that's there
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.320]   and the fact that this new individual, the step-parent,
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:36.440]   lives in their home, it just makes it all the more acute.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.560]   But you're right.
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.120]   Normal children have the same problem
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.120]   when a babysitter comes.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.160]   They'll say, you're not my real father or mother.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.040]   That's really true.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]   I mean, that's true.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.520]   Just magnify that 10 times in a step-parent relationship,
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.400]   and you see how tough it is.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.280]   I mean, the babysitter can go home and get away from this.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.520]   The step-parent can't.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:04.880]   So we saw earlier that the Bible views children as essentially
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.800]   sinful and foolish.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.380]   Their sinful nature and foolish hearts
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:11.000]   teach us that a child is both a responsible and stubborn
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.880]   decision maker.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.320]   There will be adverse things that happen in their life,
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:17.440]   but they'll choose how they think and respond
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.120]   to those circumstances.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.760]   Now, the therapeutic way of dealing with this
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.080]   is to get the child to talk about their feelings.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.880]   In fact, a group of Christian psychologists
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.840]   advise, encourage all the participants
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.720]   in the new family, children and adults,
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.480]   to express their feelings openly in a constructive way.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.600]   That's one step out of seven to help a blended family.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.680]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:44.800]   If you get these children together and you say to them,
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.080]   I want you to just openly express
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.160]   your feelings about your new family and step-family
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.640]   with mom and dad present, you know what it's going to be?
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.120]   It's going to be all-out war on that step-parent.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.360]   There's just going to be all wickedness come out,
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.000]   because that child is going to say what the first thing
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.520]   on their mind.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.760]   I hate you.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.560]   Now, according to therapy, that's
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.080]   OK, because it's a cathartic thing that's going on there.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.680]   I mean, if they're able to get these negative emotions
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.120]   and express them, they'll feel a lot better.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.240]   Well, I got news for you.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:24.600]   The feelings of the child is not the gauge of goodness
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.920]   in terms of the counseling relationship there.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.840]   It's not.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.280]   Never was.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.960]   Righteousness is the gauge.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.600]   And that child needs to learn to rethink that relationship
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.520]   in biblical terms and then deal with all this anger
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.440]   and realize how sinful that anger is
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.860]   towards their step-parent.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.120]   So I believe a lot of self-centered memories
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.660]   and hurts are going to only come out,
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.520]   and then it will fuel a division.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.280]   I don't believe there can be a constructive sharing
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.280]   of feelings when most step-children have the agenda
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.320]   to get rid of the step-parent.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.480]   That's their agenda.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.320]   In fact, it's going to be destructive.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.940]   And as a counselor who desires to help
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:07.440]   the family deal biblically needs to get
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.720]   them to evaluate their feelings and their thoughts
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.520]   from scripture, not dump all their emotions
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.440]   like gigantic dump trucks in this big free-for-all
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.360]   of counseling to get all their grievances off their chest
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.400]   and have some kind of cathartic experience.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.360]   It's not the idea.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.600]   A unified parenting agreement here
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.160]   is essential in this cauldron.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.640]   As a counselor, you need to cover four vital areas
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.240]   that the biological and step-parent
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.080]   needs to agree upon.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.040]   Number one is this.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.840]   They need to agree with the scripture
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.440]   about the roles of the husband and wife in the home.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.440]   This is not to negotiate the roles.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.040]   There's no negotiation going on here.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.920]   But as a counselor, you're going to teach them the roles,
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.320]   and they're going to fix these roles of the husband
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.560]   and wife in their home.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.200]   That's key.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.120]   Assuming both parents are biological--
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.800]   or both parents are Christian and desire
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.600]   to do things God's way, they've got
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.320]   to understand and be willing to practice
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.160]   biblical roles of husband and wife within the home.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.280]   Too often, this issue is ignored in counseling step-families.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.720]   But it's common reason so much conflict
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.520]   is going on in the home.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.040]   Practicing the proper biblical roles within the step-family
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.120]   is like setting boundary lines in tennis.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.520]   People can still break the rules,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.200]   but the boundary lines of the husband and wife
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.120]   determines the court area in which the game's
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.360]   going to be played.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.160]   And you need to set those boundary lines so
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.920]   that the kids understand it.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.640]   They're not open for discussion or revision.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.720]   They are what God expects in the home.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.920]   The husband is the head of the home.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.240]   Ephesians 5, 25 through 33.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.680]   I don't care whether he's a stepfather or not.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.920]   He's the head of that home.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.720]   Mom's not anymore.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.360]   Now that she's remarried, this means
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.560]   that he is to be a loving servant in that home,
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.040]   setting examples of meeting the needs of every family
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.200]   member without partiality.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.520]   It also means that he is the one who
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.760]   has the last say on the discipline of the children,
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.960]   even if he's a stepfather.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.720]   It is the fathers in the home who
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.480]   are responsible in God's eyes for bringing up
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.520]   a child in the discipline and nurture of the Lord.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.800]   Larry abrogated his authority when
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.840]   he decided to stop coming home and spend evenings
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.360]   at the office.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:39.040]   He should seek and trust, however, his wife's insight
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.760]   into her biological children.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.720]   He doesn't ignore that.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:43.100]   If he really loves his wife, he's
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.760]   going to listen to her carefully.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.160]   And he's going to listen to her insight
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.880]   and actually follow her counsel.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.360]   And he's responsible to lead his home
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.480]   in a selfless, caring way by treating
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:01.360]   her biological children as lovingly as he does his own,
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.180]   roughly parallel to the way in which the kinsman redeemer is
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:10.840]   to treat the family and the wife of his brother
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:17.360]   or distant cousin when he marries her and takes her
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.040]   under his household.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.600]   The wife, then, is a suitable helper,
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.960]   submissive to the husband's leadership.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.840]   She's responsible to support her husband
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.760]   and follow his lead in all matters
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.520]   unless he requires something of her that's
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.000]   clearly unbiblical and immoral.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.380]   She must ensure that the children see a unified front
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.120]   in front of her husband.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.800]   It's not his responsibility to come in line with her ideas.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.580]   It's her responsibility to come in line with his ideas.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.240]   Of course, as a good leader, the husband
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.840]   is going to be careful to listen to her concerns in regard
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.340]   to the children and take them seriously into account when he
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:54.880]   makes decisions.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.680]   Antibiblical, feminist, egalitarian dogmas
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.840]   of male-female roles within the home
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.240]   have done more to produce confusion and division
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.520]   within stepfamilies than any other single element.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.240]   In our case, Judy decided at one point
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.600]   to reject her husband's leadership
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.140]   and to always side with her daughters.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:18.520]   And it caused a fissure in the family and almost tore it apart.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.480]   She decided her ideas of child-rearing
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:22.280]   were better than his ideas.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.320]   And her children took full advantage of it.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.760]   Now, I realize that our scenario up to this particular point
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.580]   haven't dealt with an unbelieving spouse.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:35.080]   What do you do if you have a stepfather who's an unbeliever?
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.160]   What do you do if the stepmother is an unbeliever?
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.720]   And the short answer is simple.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   Putting into action is more complicated.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.440]   The believing spouse is still responsible to practice
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.040]   the same God-given biblical role.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.760]   Of course, any time an unbelieving spouse
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:51.040]   would require anything that is clearly not scriptural,
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.440]   the believing spouse has a biblical responsibility
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:57.120]   to obey God rather than man.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.920]   In any case, stepchildren desperately
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.040]   need to see biblical roles practiced in the home.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.120]   Secondly, communication that addresses
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.840]   the hearts of the children.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.120]   Another common error of many stepparents
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.600]   is to come into a new home situation,
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.840]   lay down the law, especially stepfathers.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:21.680]   The home was never intended to be a police state.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.320]   A home must be built on close personal relationship.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.760]   So if you're a stepparent who is given to legislating laws,
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.920]   you're guilty of behaviorism.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.520]   You'll produce children and stepchildren
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.880]   who will be little Pharisees.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.560]   On the outside, they'll know how to perform.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.480]   But on the inside, they'll rebel against you
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.840]   and everything you stand for.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.600]   You've got to learn to address their hearts
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.960]   as a biological parent and a stepparent.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.200]   Don't be the type of parent that just passes out discipline
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.160]   like an arresting officer.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.040]   Children, and especially stepchildren,
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.720]   need to be convinced in the depths of their own heart
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.020]   that you have their long-term interests in mind.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.360]   The way you build this is through
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.560]   meaningful, godly communication.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.480]   And that takes time.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.320]   It takes practice.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.080]   Most stepparents prefer behavioristic parenting
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.760]   techniques because it's very quick and easy.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.360]   Larry loved discipline-- I mean, behaviorism.
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.800]   He thought parenting consisted in laying down rules
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.760]   and correcting the children when they violated him.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.200]   And his rationalization-- he rationalized his approach
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:35.440]   with the observation that Judy had let her kids go on
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.120]   for so many years with little discipline
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.280]   that he had to make up for lost time.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.600]   No wonder her step-- or his stepdaughters hated him.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:52.240]   Parents-- good parenting does involve discipline.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:54.520]   But as children grow older, the discipline
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:57.480]   needs to be replaced with instruction.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.120]   Children need to internalize biblical principles.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.720]   And it is patient, loving communication
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.080]   that will make that happen.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.880]   So help your children and your stepchildren
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.360]   address the idols of their heart.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.440]   Help them learn how to understand their own heart
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.080]   and what drives their actions and attitudes.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.120]   Train them, as we've talked about earlier in this class,
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.760]   to be biblically wise in evaluating their wants
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.280]   and their desires and their cravings.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.320]   Those eight questions that we asked earlier
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:28.480]   in addressing the heart, those eight questions
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.400]   are key questions.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:35.960]   Of course, if you as a parent are not
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.280]   honest about your own heart idols, they will never be.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.480]   Larry wanted a submissive wife and obedient children.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.840]   And the fact that he grew angry, withdrew,
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.080]   and began to consider divorce revealed
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.880]   that his desires had become idolatrous desires.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.280]   Furthermore, his biological children's stepfather
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.500]   was a major test of trust in him.
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:00.040]   Well, he really wasn't a stepfather,
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.360]   because he wasn't married to Larry's ex-wife.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.720]   But technically, he was, in a sense,
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.080]   acting like a stepfather.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.920]   And Judy, then, on the other hand,
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.280]   didn't want her children to suffer any more adversity.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.460]   And so she was unwilling to confront her children
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:15.120]   with their rebellious ways.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.760]   This became an idol in Judy's heart.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.760]   She also began to resent Larry's children,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.320]   because they brought additional unwanted trouble
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.760]   into her home.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.200]   She had an idol of peace at any cost for her children.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.400]   Until Larry and Judy confront their own idols,
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.880]   they're never going to be able to help their own children
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.160]   with theirs.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.960]   Now, how can Larry and Judy help their children?
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.520]   Well, here's the communication part of it.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.800]   Larry's biological children.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.200]   His daughter and son want their old family to be restored.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   They're angry and they're bitter, because Larry's
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.960]   remarriage has prevented it.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.360]   It's wrong for them to want the restoration of their father
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:54.860]   and mother.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:55.760]   Was that wrong?
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.760]   No.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.280]   But they have allowed that desire
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:02.080]   to be more important than God's will in their lives.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.400]   They want their old home more than they want to please God.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.080]   And that's rebellion against God.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.640]   This is what drives their anger towards Judy
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.340]   and all of their disagreements with Judy's children.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.000]   Larry can help them understand this
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.200]   and show them how the Bible says that bitterness and anger
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.680]   can destroy their lives.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.160]   Judy can help her stepchildren by loving them
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.880]   in spite of their anger and showing them
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.040]   that their real anger is against God.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.960]   As Ecclesiastes 7.14 said earlier,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   God makes the bad times as well as the good.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:50.520]   But he always has our long-term interests and good in mind.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.800]   Now, what about Judy's biological children?
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.520]   Well, Judy's teenage daughters have
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.840]   grown used to their mother's full attention for eight years.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.280]   They now view Larry as a chief competitor
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:03.560]   in striving for mom's attention.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.440]   Mom even treated them almost as an equal
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.760]   after their father's death.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.680]   And now that she no longer had a husband to turn to for comfort
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.160]   and to share her adult concerns about life,
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.120]   she turned to her oldest daughters.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.800]   So they had become accustomed to being on the same adult level
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.680]   as their mother.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.080]   Combine the factors that Judy did not
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.240]   want to practice good discipline with them,
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.960]   believing that they had suffered already
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.800]   enough because of the death of their father,
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.600]   and the fact that they no longer viewed Judy as an authority
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.680]   figure but as an equal companion, all of those issues
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.480]   conspired together to cause her daughters
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.160]   to view all adults as equal.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.960]   And when Larry came into the home,
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.560]   Larry was an equal to them.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:54.640]   Consequently, when Larry came in as an authority figure that
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.880]   was intent on having a well-disciplined family,
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.960]   their resentment turned to hatred and open rebellion.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.440]   Judy's son had a different heart idol.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.040]   He had always wanted a father like other boys his age.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.780]   Larry was a welcome addition to the family,
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:12.160]   but Larry's biological son was a threat to his dream.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.520]   Jealousy grew in his heart as Larry's son
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.900]   came for a visit every weekend.
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:20.840]   And his dream for a father did not include a stepbrother
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.960]   that he'd have to share his father with.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.520]   Soon, Judy's son was taking every opportunity
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.280]   he could to privately sabotage Larry's relationship
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.920]   with his biological son when Larry wasn't around.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:37.160]   Now, Judy needs to help her daughters and her sons
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.560]   see the issues that dominate their hearts.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:44.000]   Larry, as their stepfather, can support this effort
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.200]   by individually building personal relationships
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.040]   with each of those stepchildren.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.280]   And together, they need to meet with each of the children
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.200]   individually and work with them to identify and repent
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:58.460]   of these idols biblically.
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:01.800]   Issues like anger, bitterness, resentment, jealousy,
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.880]   unfulfilled expectations are all addressed--
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.720]   they're all a part of this home, and they're
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.280]   addressed in the Bible.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.520]   Larry and Judy must do their biblical homework
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:14.520]   and arrange time to build this kind of understanding
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.320]   with each child.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.620]   Now, number three, minimal rules for the home.
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:22.760]   What are those?
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.880]   Well, you could divide them into two groups.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.100]   Number one, there's absolute rules
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:31.860]   that cannot be compromised.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.700]   Where the Bible speaks about the conduct of people and children
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:37.100]   in clarity, it must be known that these cannot be
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:38.800]   compromised in the home.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:41.460]   Those are God's absolute rules.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.540]   Those are the rules of heaven.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.680]   They're not just the household rules.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:53.100]   But the second type is rules of the household.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.060]   And those are not necessarily God's rules,
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:58.540]   but a stepdad and stepmom's best ways of living out
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.200]   godliness in their home.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:02.140]   They're not always perfect, because they
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.700]   are human inventions.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.620]   But unless there is a good biblical reason,
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:08.420]   they should be changed.
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:10.360]   Children are supposed to follow them.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.460]   What are we talking about?
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:14.380]   We're talking about standards of cleaning, rooms, curfews,
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:17.460]   dress, music, chores, allowance, use of the car,
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.980]   academic grades, choice of friends.
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:21.980]   All of those are wisdom issues that
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:26.220]   have no direct biblical commands.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.580]   But parents must make decisions about these issues
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:31.100]   if they're going to be good parents.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:34.900]   Last of all, what are the procedures and policy
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:35.780]   for discipline?
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:38.860]   And I believe it is vitally important
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.640]   that a step-parent and biological parent
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:43.540]   sit down and work out a consistent, workable plan
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:47.600]   of discipline for their home that both in good conscience
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.100]   can be committed to.
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.600]   Often, a biblical counselor can help them work through this.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.140]   But remember the warning of Ephesians 6:4.
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.380]   Don't produce a plan that will incite your children
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.700]   to anger and exasperation.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.780]   I like what Charles Hodge says in commenting on Ephesians 6:4,
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.120]   that parents are not to excite the bad passions
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.740]   of their children, nor is the father, by his own conduct,
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:14.300]   to nurture evil in the heart of the child.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:15.820]   William Hendrickson, his commentary,
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:18.220]   says do not exasperate or embitter your child.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.580]   Do not provoke your child to an angry mood.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.540]   Larry, in our example, could very well
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.540]   have done this with his stepchildren.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.660]   In other words, do not provoke your children
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:30.980]   to a wrathful kind of living, to become
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.980]   angry young men and women.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.020]   You'll produce an angry man or woman
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:39.500]   that Proverbs warns about in Proverbs 22, 24,
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.940]   or a man of great anger in Proverbs 19, 19,
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:49.540]   or a man who has no control over his spirit in Proverbs 25, 28.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:55.340]   So those are the four rules of basic agreement
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.540]   that need to be there.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:03.620]   So the husband must be the head of the home.
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.100]   The wife is a suitable helper.
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:09.780]   The biblical communication, the rules
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:14.460]   must be policy in the home.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:17.660]   Absolute rules of God cannot be compromised.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:20.840]   Provisional rules of the household are needed.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.740]   Biblical discipline should be consistent.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:25.620]   That's what we're after.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.060]   Questions about that?
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:31.900]   Covered a lot of material.
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:34.860]   Let me emphasize in this before you leave.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.940]   In counseling, it's vitally important
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.940]   that if the step parents disagree,
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:44.020]   that they disagree with one another behind closed doors,
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:48.180]   out of the view and the hearing of the children.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:52.260]   If mom disagrees with dad, she does it behind closed doors.
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:55.900]   They are always presenting a united front
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.940]   before the children, where the children do not
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:03.060]   see a speck of daylight between mom and dad.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.780]   That always-- especially in a step parent home.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:14.220]   Well, I have one last assignment.
[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:16.220]   Have a good evening.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:18.020]   Bye.
