[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Why did God create us?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.960]   It's a grand and glorious question, and it touches on the biggest issues of our lives
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.080]   that we can really ever ask about.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.220]   It's also today's question from an APJ listener named Natalie.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.320]   She writes in, "Pastor John, thank you so much for this podcast.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.220]   I listen to every episode.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.640]   I am a thinker, an over-thinker, probably, and of late my mind has been dwelling on the
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.600]   sufficiency of God himself, that he needs no one or nothing that he creates.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.240]   I affirm Acts 17.25 and Psalm 50 verses 7 to 15.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.920]   But the question I cannot answer is this, Pastor John, why did God create us?"
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.120]   This question is very important, both because of very high-level theological and philosophical
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   reasons and because when the alarm goes off this morning at 5 or 6 or 7, how you answer
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.520]   this question makes all the difference for why you get out of bed.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.200]   So at the theological and philosophical level, the question is important because the way
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.160]   you answer it has a huge impact on the way you understand the nature of God himself,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.060]   that is, what does it mean to be God?
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:40.120]   The technical name here that people debate is God's aseity, A-S-E-I-T-Y, the word
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.560]   aseity built on the Latin words "a" or "a," which means "from," and "se,"
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.760]   which means "self."
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   So from himself, God's aseity is his existence from himself.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.160]   That is, he exists without influence or input or resources or forces or anything from outside
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.560]   himself.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:18.120]   Or the shorthand way to say aseity in common English would be God's self-sufficiency.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.440]   This is important because the biblical picture of God is that he is complete and sufficient
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.500]   and flawless and without any defect or deficiency in and of himself.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.680]   That means before there was any creation and apart from any creation and independent of
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.200]   any creation, God was completely and flawlessly God.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   Think for example of the Bible passage Exodus 3.14, where Moses asks God what he should
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   say to the people of Israel when they ask him, "Who sent you?"
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.440]   And God says to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.880]   And he said, "Say to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.600]   In other words, my very name, Yahweh, which is built on the verb "I AM"—cursed 600
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.440]   times plus in the Bible—that very name, every time you read the name, usually translated
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.060]   capital L-O-R-D in the English versions, that very name bears witness to the absolute existence
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.920]   of God in and of himself.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   I AM.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   That's my name.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.280]   I AM.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.920]   I depend on nothing, nobody to be who I am.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.760]   I am absolute reality.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.160]   I had no beginning.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.800]   I will have no ending.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.560]   And in relation to creation, I am not becoming what I am.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.840]   Lots of people called process theologians think that God is becoming God.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.080]   He's getting better all the time.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.160]   He's growing into what it means to be God by creating the world and interacting with
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   the world.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   He gets better.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.520]   That's not the way the Bible speaks.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.800]   It's not the way I think.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   I don't think that's the way we should think about God.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.040]   We cannot improve upon God.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.820]   He cannot improve.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.440]   He says, "I AM.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.160]   I always have been fully, perfectly, flawlessly God before and apart from all creation."
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.040]   That's what the doctrine of aseity, or God's self-sufficiency, affirms and protects.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.120]   And I think that's a biblical reality, that we should believe it and stress it.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   And I think the biblical reality and teaching of the Trinity—God as Father, Son, and Holy
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.400]   Spirit—is essential to that doctrine of God's self-sufficiency, because what the
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.800]   Trinity implies in the relationships between the Father and the Son and the Spirit is that
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.480]   God is love and has always been love.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.600]   The Bible says God is love.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.080]   He's always been love.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.240]   Before there was a world to love, God was love.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.960]   The divine Son is and always has been, in the fellowship of the Trinity, God's image
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.440]   and God's delight.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.880]   He's called both of those in the Bible.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   Jesus, before he was the incarnate Jesus Christ, was the Son of God.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   And in the fellowship of the everlasting, eternal Trinity, he was the perfect image
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.100]   of God and he was the delight of God.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.720]   God did not have to create the world in order to have full, satisfying joy in the fellowship
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.880]   of the Trinity.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:11.100]   So the doctrine of aseity, or God's self-sufficiency, not only protects the self-sufficiency and
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.640]   absoluteness of God's godness from any suggestion that creation is essential to his
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.480]   being—that's the danger, thinking that creation is part of his being and his being
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:32.160]   perfect—but aseity also protects God's nature as a Trinity of fully satisfied persons
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.240]   delighting in each other eternally apart from creation.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   All of that implies a negative.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.800]   God did not create the world out of any deficiency or defect.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:56.480]   Creation did not make God more God or improve upon his perfection.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.580]   So we ask, is there any way to answer the question, why did he create the universe?
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:10.400]   Have we described God's essential being and his Trinitarian fullness and his happiness
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.120]   in such a way as to virtually rule out any motive for creating the world, any motive
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   that would not compromise his self-sufficiency?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:30.120]   I think it would be a great dishonor to God if we said that the creation of the universe
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:41.160]   were merely random or whimsical with no purpose, no motive, no wise and purposeful design or
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.920]   motive at all, lest that purpose or motive be somehow construed as God's "finally,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.000]   finally, he can be happy.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.720]   He's got a creation to love" or something like that.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.360]   Namely, through creation he completes himself.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.960]   That would be a great dishonor to God to say that he couldn't create with a motive and
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.320]   with wisdom and design without jeopardizing his Godness.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.040]   So that answer to the why he created the world, I think, would be called a heresy.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.680]   Like it was just whimsical, it had no meaning, had no design in it, no motive behind it,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680]   no wisdom.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.120]   That's why the doctrine of God's acety is important, to protect us against that
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.680]   heresy.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   So how then do we answer the question why God created?
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:41.200]   And I go to a passage like—and there are more, many more—Isaiah 43, 6, and 7, remembering,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   by the way, that every promise of the Old Testament is yes in Christ for us Christians
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.280]   and all who believe in Christ, those Old Testament promises are true.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   And it says, "Bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:08.320]   who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made, created
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   for my glory."
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:19.200]   Now on the basis of that text, and many like it, I see that pervading the entire Bible
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   is the teaching that God does everything to communicate and display to his creatures his
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:38.760]   own glory, his greatness, his beauty, his worth, the whole panorama of his perfections.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:47.080]   He communicates that, displays that to his creatures as the overflow of his love.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:55.200]   And I add very quickly this, the reason that the communication and display of God's glory
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:05.920]   is the overflow of his love is because that glory both rejoices the human heart supremely
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.000]   and reflects the greatness of God supremely.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.440]   Or to say it with my favorite words, which you know, Tony, and we love together, God
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:35.520]   God's eternal love in the fellowship of the Trinity was a perfectly God-satisfying, God-glorifying
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.280]   joy before there was any creation.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.000]   God's fullness was on display for God among the persons of the Trinity, and God's fullness
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.760]   was the undiminished delight of the persons of the Trinity.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   And this is what he communicated in creation to us, to his people.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.800]   He gave to all who would have it, all who would receive it as their treasure, he gave
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:17.360]   us a share in the God-displaying, God-glorifying delight that God has in God.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   And if you press even harder on me and say, "But why?
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.800]   Why did he do this if he was so full and happy without creation?"
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:38.200]   I would say it's the nature of the fullness of the divine love to share itself.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.560]   That's just what love is like in God.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.880]   And this sharing is not the completion of God or the improvement of God.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:59.480]   Jonathan Edwards, I think, said it most memorably when he said, "It is no sign of a fountain's
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.520]   deficiency that it is prone to overflow."
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:12.280]   When the alarm goes off now at five or six or seven tomorrow morning, you can know—this
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.320]   is glorious—individually, personally, existentially so relevant.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.800]   You can know the purpose for which God made you and why you should get out of bed.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:36.840]   We exist to see and savor and show the beauty and worth and greatness of God in every sphere
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.600]   of our lives.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   Paul said, "Whether you eat or drink," in other words, the most nitty-gritty things,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.240]   "Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God," 1 Corinthians
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.560]   10:31.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:13:00.980]   We exist to bring our lives into alignment with the purpose of God in creation, namely
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:12.240]   his purpose to communicate his glory in the overflow of his God-exalting, soul-satisfying
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.280]   love.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:24.240]   And what that alignment looks like is this—our magnifying God's glory by finding him to
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.480]   be the most satisfying reality in the universe.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   Amen.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.080]   This episode really seems to lead right into your new book, Providence, where you talk
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.880]   about the design of God for his creation and for us.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Absolutely.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Yeah, wonderful.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   Great question, Natalie.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   Thank you for sending it in to us.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   And speaking of the meaning of life, there's still quite a lot to say about this, especially
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.240]   as it relates to God's providence directly, his design for us.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.280]   And we're going to actually return on Wednesday to look at how God's governance over all things
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:01.700]   means that everything in life, everything, is made meaningful by God's design.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.240]   It is such a huge topic, very fitting as a follow-up to what we talked about today.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.920]   That's coming up next time on Wednesday when we return.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.400]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   We will see you then.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.600]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   [END]
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   1. What is God's design for us?
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   2. What is God's design for us?
