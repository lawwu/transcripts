[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Sibling rivalries, that's our theme today.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.200]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360]   We've talked about siblings on the podcast
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.040]   in a couple of different contexts.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.080]   We addressed the prodigal son
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.080]   and his older brother in APJ 1059.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.240]   And we looked at how Jesus is our perfect elder brother
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.880]   in APJ 934.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.960]   I love that episode.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   The fact that Jesus is our brother.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.760]   He calls us brothers.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.440]   But today we get a question
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.920]   about sibling rivalries in the home.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.360]   Something we have not yet addressed on the podcast.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360]   And here's the question today for you, Pastor John,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.380]   who once again joins us remotely over Zoom.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.440]   The question is from Stephanie.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.720]   Pastor John and Tony, thank you for all the work
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.880]   and thoughtfulness you put into APJ.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.760]   I have listened for years,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.440]   always encouraged by hearing brothers and sisters
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.560]   ask questions I would never even think to ask myself.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.120]   Your careful responses exemplify 1 Peter 3.15.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.040]   Always to be prepared to give an answer
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.920]   to everyone who asks you to give the reason
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.360]   for the hope that you have with gentleness and respect.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   My question for you is about sibling rivalry.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.520]   In Genesis, it seems that every family dynamic
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.000]   was affected by jealousy or envy between siblings.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.320]   Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, Rachel and Leah,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   Joseph and his brothers.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   Just to name a few.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.800]   What are gospel implications of this reoccurring plot theme
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.280]   in the Bible and seeing that many
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.960]   of these broken relationships are the result
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.420]   of favoritism or passivity by parents?
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440]   What lessons can we learn as fathers and mothers today?
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.760]   - Wow, what a good question.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.600]   - It is.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.480]   - That caused me to do some serious thinking
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.880]   on things I haven't quite posed in that way.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.600]   So let's start at the beginning.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.840]   God creates man, male and female,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.840]   and designs that by becoming one flesh in marriage,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   they would have children who are called
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600]   in their relationship to each other, brothers and sisters.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.720]   So this is a universally understood relationship.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.540]   It's amazing.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.000]   Brothers and sisters, all over the world.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   Everybody knows what that is.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.160]   Every culture understands what brothers and sisters are
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.960]   together with marriage.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   This relationship is primal.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.080]   It's really basic.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.880]   Brothers and sisters ordinarily grow up
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.040]   under the care of parents and are helped
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.220]   to be productive adults in the family structure
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.200]   all over the world.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.880]   Now, sin enters the world
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.460]   and its first devastating effect is on the married couple.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.820]   Adam blames Eve, Eve blames the serpent.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.860]   Their innocence is over.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.420]   Shame and guilt come into their relationship
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.440]   and wreak havoc.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.860]   And the next relationship that we read about
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.900]   as contaminated and ruined by sin
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.020]   is Cain killing his brother, Apel.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.020]   So the basic family structure is brought into being by God
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.780]   and then sin moves out through that family structure
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.660]   to destroy all the relationships.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.660]   Simultaneously though, God's grace enters into the world
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.500]   and begins to do its redemptive work.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.660]   And what we are to see is that in these very broken
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.460]   and sin ruined relationships of brother and brother
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.820]   and sister and sister, God nevertheless has worked
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.740]   redemptively, savingly.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.980]   We see it in God's relationship with Isaac and Ishmael.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.260]   We see it in his relationship to Jacob and Esau.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.260]   We see it in Egypt where Moses said to two Israelites,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.600]   why are you fighting?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.260]   Are you not brothers?
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.180]   And in that very context of brother against brother,
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.620]   God is saving his people.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.660]   When Jesus enters the world,
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.740]   two dramatic things happen in the way Jesus defines
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.180]   the relationship between himself and his followers
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.980]   and then the way those followers understand
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.380]   their relationship with each other.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.860]   First, he defines his relationship with those who follow him
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.780]   as brothers to himself,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.780]   whether there's any physical family relationship or not.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.780]   For example, he says in Mark 2, 32 to 35,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.380]   a crowd was sitting around him and they said to him,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.900]   your mother and your brothers are outside seeking you.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.700]   And he answered them, who are my mother and my brothers?
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.420]   And looking around at those who sat at his feet,
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.420]   he said, here are my mother and my brothers.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.220]   For whoever does the will of God,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.860]   he is my brother and sister and mother.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.740]   And in the picture of the final judgment,
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.740]   when the disciples ask the king when they served him,
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.620]   it says the king will answer them,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.300]   truly I say to you,
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   as you did it unto one of the least of these my brothers,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.780]   you did it to me.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.180]   So the followers of Jesus who love like Jesus
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.060]   are brothers of the king of the universe.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.660]   This dramatic act of identifying as brother
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.220]   to his followers had a huge implication
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.660]   for how they understood their relationship to each other
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.140]   and how the apostles later
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.100]   taught about the nature of the church.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.900]   For example, Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.180]   you are not to be called rabbi,
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.540]   for you have one teacher and you are all brothers.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.820]   They weren't physical brothers,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.780]   they were a new kind of brother.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.860]   So to each other, brother to each other,
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.700]   not just brother to him.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.740]   And then when we turn to the apostle Paul
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.220]   and ask how he understood the relationship
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.460]   among believers in the church,
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.980]   we find an amazing fact.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.940]   Just to give you a sense of proportion,
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.420]   this was a surprise to me.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.180]   I've made a big deal out of Paul's favorite name
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.540]   for Christians being saints, right?
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.420]   He loves to call Christian saint.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.220]   40 times he calls Christians saints.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.180]   But when you ask, well, what about brother?
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.540]   What was his real favorite?
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.540]   He refers to Christians as brothers over 130 times.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.580]   So Paul picked up on Jesus' reference
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.580]   to himself as brother, as well as to each other.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.780]   He says in Romans 8, 29,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.900]   those whom God foreknew,
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.420]   he predestined to be conformed to the image of his son
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.940]   So God predestined us to be the brothers of the son of God
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.700]   and for him to be preeminent.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.620]   So the link is finally made with God, God explicitly,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.220]   son of God, Jesus Christ is the preeminent firstborn
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.380]   among many brothers,
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.380]   meaning that the whole church are the children of God
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.140]   and part of a divine family
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.180]   through the redemptive work of Christ.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.180]   This is breathtaking if you just let it sink in.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.260]   God's original creation order of husband and wife
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.180]   and then brother and brother
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.260]   become the two dominant ways of thinking about Christ
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.220]   and his church.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.780]   He's the elder brother to brothers and sisters in the church
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.700]   and he is the husband to his bride, the church.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   God's original design finds its fulfillment,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.900]   not mainly in the redeemed earthly nuclear families,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.660]   but mainly in the divine family with the son of God
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.500]   as preeminent brother over his brothers and sisters
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.220]   and as the husband over his bride.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.660]   Now, what about the second part of Stephanie's question?
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.660]   What can we do as fathers and mothers to foster peace,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.220]   minimize rivalry between our children?
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.220]   And I think the little survey that we just did sheds light
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.460]   and I think I've got four things here quickly
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.780]   just to mention.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.300]   So what should I do as a parent?
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.220]   I've got old kids now, the oldest is 50
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.540]   and many of our listeners have tiny kids.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.020]   So what can we do to help minimize
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.700]   a sinful sibling rivalry?
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.420]   Number one, don't make the mistake of Adam and Eve.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.420]   They rejected God as an all wise, all providing father
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.840]   and replaced him with their own private preferences
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.980]   and the result was a destroyed family.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.740]   So turn that around and make God in Christ
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.700]   the supreme treasure of your life
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.580]   and trust his word and his care implicitly.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.500]   Let the children see you do that.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.020]   Mom and dad trust and treasure God.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.620]   Mom and dad have a heavenly father
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.080]   and they trust him to take care of them and us.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.380]   Number two, teach the children that this natural family
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.700]   that they're part of is not ultimate.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.380]   Belonging to God's family is ultimate.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.380]   Humans, boys and girls, teenagers need something great
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.580]   to live for, something much greater
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.660]   than the natural physical family they're a part of.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.100]   If you idolize that family, it will not suffice
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.680]   for the human soul.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.780]   If they can be captured by something glorious
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.420]   that is greater than the family, namely the global family
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.860]   from all the nations, they will have resources
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.380]   to love their natural family better.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.500]   Number three, teach them that squabbling
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.860]   over which is the greatest puts them in the category
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.140]   of those who do not understand Jesus.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.580]   When the disciples did that, who's the greater among you?
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.580]   Jesus said, who is the greater?
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.140]   One who reclines at table or one who serves?
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.820]   Is it not the one who reclines at table?
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.500]   And yet, I am among you as the one who serves.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.300]   In other words, if you follow Jesus,
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.620]   then being a servant is true greatness.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.320]   So if you want to try to be greater than your brother
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.980]   or your sister, be a greater servant.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.420]   Finally, number four, when you think about
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.260]   the different gifts that your children have,
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.060]   don't demean or discount any of them.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.460]   Take your cue from Paul's teaching
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.020]   in 1 Corinthians 12, 24 and 25.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.740]   He said, God has so composed the body,
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.820]   giving greater honor to the part that lacked it.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.500]   That there may be no division in the body,
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.100]   but that the members may have the same care for one another.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.260]   There's no point in pretending that your children
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.340]   are all equal in every way.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.540]   They know they're not, you know they're not.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.540]   Some are better at one thing, some at another.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.460]   The key is teaching them the humility
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.060]   of viewing everyone as precious and useful
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.420]   in God's sight as they are.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.760]   Nobody is wasted.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.820]   God doesn't waste his creation.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.100]   Nobody's pointless.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.020]   Everyone has a design in God's mind
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.980]   and they're called, they're called to something significant.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.860]   So, Stephanie, thank you for a very provocative
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   and helpful question for me.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.100]   It was good for me to think about this.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.100]   May God help us to love being God's children,
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.100]   Christ's brothers and sisters,
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.540]   and may God make us good examples to our children.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.020]   Yes, a very provocative and helpful question and response.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.900]   This is our first episode on sibling rivalries in the home.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.640]   What else needs to be addressed in this topic?
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.260]   Tell us, email your question to us
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.600]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.120]   And speaking of sibling rivalries
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.740]   and tensions inside the home,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.340]   tensions in the family can bubble over
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.880]   into months long and years long
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.120]   and even decades long feuds.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.220]   So how do we learn to forgive family?
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.100]   An important question.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.280]   And it's the question up next.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.620]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.740]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.780]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
