[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   If you're planning on doing any shopping for the holidays then I hope this
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.880]   episode will both give you a ton of inspiration and ideas for gifts as well
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.380]   as walk you through the three to four major ways I get anywhere from 5 to 25
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.760]   percent off almost all my shopping. I'm Chris Hutchins and today's gift guide
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.800]   will include over 80 different ideas for the holiday season across a bunch of
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.000]   categories from tech to kitchen, clothes, health, games, kids, and learning. And in
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.880]   addition to sharing how I make sure I'm always saving including discounted
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.920]   gift cards, cash back, card-length offers, and more, I'm gonna close this out by
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.400]   sharing a few of our family traditions for the holidays. And if you want to jump
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.920]   around you'll find timestamps in the show notes to make it easier to do it.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640]   Also please know that none of the items in this gift guide have paid me to be a
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   part of this list, however some of them are sponsors of the show. But that makes
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.120]   sense because as I've said before most of my sponsors are here because I
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.000]   reached out to them after loving their products. And while I often read out the
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.280]   URL for things on the show there's just too many products so I'm gonna put all
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.040]   the links to everything including all the discounts I find at allthehacks.com/gifts
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.960]   And since a few of these links are from sponsors or are my affiliate links to
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.880]   sites like Amazon I would obviously greatly appreciate it if you want to use
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440]   them to support me in the show. Of course if you find a better deal somewhere else
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.200]   absolutely go there instead. Again all the links are at allthehacks.com/gifts
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.880]   And if you enjoy this episode please share it with a friend, leave a comment
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.420]   or review. And if you want to keep upgrading your life money and travel
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.720]   click follow or subscribe. So I'm gonna start with some tech and personal gift
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.080]   ideas. First I want to start with a product I use literally every single day
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.320]   and that's the Moft iPhone wallet. It's a magnetic wallet that sticks on your
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.120]   iPhone. I carry it almost everywhere I go. It holds about three cards maybe it's
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   two when you start with it it stretches a little bit. You could put you know a
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400]   $20 bill in there also just in case you need cash. I really think this is the
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.600]   best wallet. It also flips out so it can become a stand so you can balance your
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   phone if you're watching something or you want to keep it upright on your desk.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   Definitely an amazing product. Pretty small could be a stocking stuffer as
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.280]   well. Other product for your phone is the Anker charging stand. There are so many
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.080]   different charging stands that you can buy on Amazon, in the Apple Store,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.160]   anywhere really and so I'm not saying this is the best one. I really like
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.720]   Anker's products though and what's great about this one is with the new iOS they
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.920]   kind of have that clock display which I really like but it also has a charging
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.560]   case below built into the stand for air pods or an Apple Watch or anything else.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.200]   So really love these charging stands. We have one on my desk, we have one on the
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.040]   sides of our bed and we even put one in the kitchen just so that we could charge
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.880]   our phone easily and quickly when we're cooking or doing stuff around the house.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   Side bonus is if you put one in your kitchen it forces you to keep your phone
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.000]   charging in a way so you can go be a little bit more present with others
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.720]   which I also like. I mentioned that it charges your AirPods. I've been using
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040]   older gen AirPods for a long time but recently I've been getting to such
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.080]   little battery life that I upgraded to the AirPod 4 and I really really like
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.120]   the noise canceling that they added. It's just so noticeable on an airplane or in
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.720]   a noisy space so I'm really happy with that and the MagSafe case and the
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.560]   addition of USB C means I now no longer need a lightning cable to charge any of
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   the devices we have which is also great. I've mentioned multiple times probably
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.480]   in last year's gift guide that AirTags make a great gift. Also we throw them in
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920]   all of our bags whenever we're traveling just to get that little extra peace of
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   mind that we know where our bags are and if for some reason they got lost we
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.640]   could kind of help find them which can sometimes just be helpful at an airport
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   or something like that. In fact I actually had a dream last night that I
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.340]   had two flights and I checked my bag on the flight I didn't take and for some
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.840]   reason in that dream maybe it was preparing for this episode I didn't have
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800]   AirTags and I was kind of stressed out about it. Okay don't worry this is not
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.400]   just a giant Apple ad that might be the last Apple product. So next I want to
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.760]   talk about the Anker. I think it's called the GAN Prime Power Bank. It looks just
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.720]   like a power brick that you could plug in a USB or a USB C charger but it also
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.520]   has a 10,000 milliamp hour battery built into it and a high power 30 watt
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   charging port. This has kind of replaced my need to bring any of the plugs that I
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.320]   use so I can charge my phone and my computer through it but it also has
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.720]   enough battery that it gets a handful of charges and can even do a pretty decent
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.440]   job charging a laptop. Next few are a bit nerdy but I mentioned this on my
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   Stuff I Use episode that I kind of got really excited about backing things up
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.400]   locally mostly because I started amassing so much content from this
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   podcast, from photos I take with a nicer camera, from videos we're making that I
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   just wanted a place to have a backup that wasn't in the cloud that was a
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.920]   little bit larger than needing to pay for more than two terabytes of storage.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.320]   So I got the Synology disk station DS923 plus. It's basically a network
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.360]   attached storage drive that you could throw three to four hard drives into and
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.120]   it will operate as a backup that's on the network but if you want you can sync
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.720]   different folders to the cloud. If anyone needs something for local backup and
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.200]   storage this is a great idea. It's really easy to connect to the network attached
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.120]   to any computer and use as kind of an external hard drive, do regular backups
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.520]   especially if you have slower internet or someone in your family does and they
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.440]   can't easily back things up online. Two other fun nerdy gifts are a Raspberry
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.160]   Pi which for anyone not familiar is basically a really tiny sub $100
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   computer that you can load all kinds of things onto from home automation to
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.240]   little servers. So that's something fun for kind of a tinkerer or a tech person.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.840]   Next is probably one that a lot of people listening have which is a set of
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.680]   Sonos speakers or especially if it's not a set the Sonos Move speaker is
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.720]   waterproof, portable. The Sonos system even though the latest app update for
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.120]   Sonos is so bad and I wish they would go back, I just think they're the best
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   speakers that you can have for connecting everything in your house,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   doing everything remotely so that you can kind of play music without having to
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.160]   rely on your phone in case you need to take a phone call. I'm just such a big
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:32.440]   fan. In the bedroom, I love the Eight Sleep Pod Cover 4 that we have. It's a
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.480]   fantastic product. It basically cools and heats your mattress on both sides to
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.000]   whatever temperature you want. It kind of adjusts that throughout the night. It has
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.860]   an autopilot feature. Amy and I both have very different perspectives on what
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.560]   temperature we want the bed and it's just magical, right? If on winter nights
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.200]   you can go in and dial it up and you can have a warm cozy bed but once you're
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.520]   asleep it'll drop the temperature so that you actually get a better night
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.760]   sleep because I guess the science often shows that slightly cooler temperatures
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.320]   at night help better sleep. There's a great deal for that in the show notes I
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.400]   believe for everyone. Then I love my Aura Ring. I had this both in fitness and here
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.760]   but I figured since we're talking about sleep I'll mention it. I got one of the
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.320]   newer ones that tracks heart rate for workouts so it does a little bit more. My
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.240]   original first gen that I bought, I looked back in the history, I bought on
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   PayPal before they even had an e-commerce website. It still worked but
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.760]   the battery wasn't what it used to be. Earlier this year or maybe late last
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.360]   year I did an episode with Molly from Sleep is a Skill and she has a whole
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.620]   store set up so if you want to dial in your sleep I'll put a link in the show
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.680]   notes and the gift guide to her store which has a ton of different
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.120]   products to help promote better sleep from different lights to different you
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.720]   know glasses and eye masks and all kinds of stuff so I'll link to that there's
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   some really cool stuff in there. The next three I didn't know where to put them so
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.280]   everything I just mentioned was kind of technology related but these are three
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.040]   gifts one of which I've given multiple times which is a subscription to Delete
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.400]   Me. It is not the sexiest gift you can give anyone but I've given it to all of
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.240]   our parents. Surprise if you're listening it might be a gift for siblings. I just
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.520]   think with the amount of scamming and phishing and what AI can do to compound
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.840]   that it's more important now than ever to kind of scrub your data off the
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.120]   internet so you're just a little bit harder to find and less of a target so
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.680]   Delete Me will go in and regularly and continuously pull all of your name email
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.160]   address phone number relative names etc off of the hundreds and hundreds of data
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.520]   broker websites out there that are just constantly sharing that information so
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.920]   they've been a longtime partner of the show I reached out to them we were
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.600]   actually their first podcast sponsor ever and so we've got a great 20% off
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.720]   discount on the gift guide site. Next is one that I've never actually given but
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.320]   have received and and my wife has received a few which is just a fun video
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.440]   from Cameo. You basically can hire a celebrity usually not a list but B
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.280]   through F list celebrity to go record a one-minute video to send to someone and
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.880]   depending on the relationship that you have with someone it can be a fun gift
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.600]   to send someone you just really don't know what to what to send but you know
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.640]   there's a mutual show or sports team that you guys love. Last there's this
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.280]   company Funko that makes these kind of plastic kind of action figure style
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   characters and they actually have a thing called pop yourself where you can
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.160]   go in and design your own character and so you know you pick skin tone and
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.400]   whether you want eyelashes and different hairstyles and what color they are and
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.440]   you can pick the clothes and then you can basically create a character and
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.240]   give it to someone and so it's not you know 3d printed perfect image of you but
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.040]   it's just kind of a fun thing that it I was thinking this year about whether
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.560]   there was someone that would make a good gift for no affiliation to these guys I
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.080]   just thought it was kind of a cool idea. So that's mostly kind of the personal
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.000]   tech stuff but a lot of the next category is also technology and that's
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.640]   food and kitchen stuff and for some reason I feel like maybe it's just that
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.520]   we love to eat we love to cook there are so many ideas of things that we've asked
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.280]   for things that we've gifted in the past few years that all fall into this bucket
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.520]   and so recently a gift we received was an air fryer and you know I'm not gonna
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.400]   say that the one we got is the only one you should get we got a Kosori 9-in-1
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   countertop air fryer it is absolutely awesome I am actually really surprised
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.480]   at how often we use this to cook almost everything from fish to chicken we've
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.920]   cooked pizzas in it we've cooked french fries great for making quick things like
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.800]   chicken nuggets for the kids reheating food we use it all the time I might be
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   late to this game I know a lot of people have an air fryer already but definitely
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.220]   a cool gift idea and thank you mom and dad because we didn't have one and we
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.200]   didn't ask for one and there's nothing I love more than getting gifts that I
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.320]   didn't ask for another one that I've now gifted a handful of times is a ninja
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.240]   creamy which is a kind of frozen ice cream sorbet milkshake maker but the
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.560]   thing that I love about it most is you can make just an incredible protein ice
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.960]   cream so I'll link to both the product and the recipe for that protein ice
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   cream but the ice cream it makes is just so so good and you can make it with no
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.640]   sugar added and it just tastes like ice cream even though there's no sugar it's
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.480]   it's mind-blowing so really big fan of the ninja creamy also for the kids it
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.440]   makes amazing sorbet so you can mash up a bunch of bananas freeze it and it'll
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.240]   just blend it into this banana ice cream where the only ingredient is ice cream
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.600]   and it's delicious we've done it with strawberries and other fruit as well so
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.440]   love the ninja creamy shout out to I believe it was Sahil bloom who's been on
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.880]   the podcast for first turning me on to this next is almost anything that Breville
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.040]   makes I can't speak to every product they have because we haven't used all of
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.480]   them but we do have the tea maker and the immersion blender I think we have
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.960]   another blender and I just think if you're trying to buy a kitchen product
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.560]   we've just been really happy with the Breville products big fans there I also
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.840]   think that something that we use all the time and I mentioned this in stuff I use
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.360]   and I got some feedback so I'll clarify here is a Belgian waffle maker and one
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   of those like double Belgian waffle makers that you spin over and back
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.480]   someone emailed me and said hey the the one you recommended is $400 like is it
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.680]   really that good and my answer is no no it's really not that good I went back
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.120]   and looked and it was only $75 when we bought it so I absolutely wouldn't get
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.360]   the one I got but I'm surprised at how often we use a double Belgian waffle
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.960]   maker in our house to make Belgian waffles and a lot of time we use Kodiak
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.120]   cake add eggs and milk to make kind of high-protein Belgian waffles and they're
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.800]   just a staple and kind of a weekend morning thing for us almost every week
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.640]   one other thing we've been making a lot of is smash burgers in fact we were at a
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.560]   burger place the other day and my wife didn't get a burger even though she
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.000]   loves them and I was like why not and she's like honestly I just want smash
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.320]   burgers I don't want these gourmet burgers and so this year we had kind of
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.280]   a burger party for 4th of July and I bought this Cuisinart kit there are a
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.520]   lot of different ones but it basically comes with like a cast-iron press a
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.360]   bunch of sheets of I guess parchment paper that you can use so nothing gets
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.480]   stuck to it and a shaker that you know buy you whatever your favorite seasoning
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   is for a smash burger and and a big strong spatula and wow we make smash
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.880]   burgers all the time get a little brioche bun toast it really really big
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.140]   fan another thing we make a lot is homemade pizza the Ooni pizza oven is
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.240]   something that we actually gave to a family member during the holidays a few
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.640]   years back and they've gotten so much use out of it so if you like a fresh
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.400]   homemade pizza there's just nothing as good as a homemade pizza in a pizza oven
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.720]   and the Ooni pizza oven is such a great way to do it fun one that I've mentioned
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.920]   in the past is the - rapid egg cooker just a really kind of like a silly gag
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.480]   gift almost in that it's so cheap you can get it sometimes for as low as like
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.560]   ten fifteen dollars but it's just a great way to cook hard-boiled eggs my
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.440]   wife loves them and so I've got this easy way to make basically perfect
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.120]   hard-boiled eggs and never have to worry about it and the kids love the music it
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.480]   makes when it's done so highly recommend that if that's a staple in your house a
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.840]   long time ago we had chef David Chang on and he was talking about any day cook
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.600]   ware and it's a set of microwave cookware that if you haven't listened
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.640]   to that episode go back because I think you won't believe me and this is
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.160]   something funny where I gifted it to my mom and she also didn't really believe
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.640]   me and then I told her to give a chance and now she's like I make all the
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.840]   vegetables I make all of our mashed potatoes and half the time she's like I
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.720]   never thought I would cook as much in the microwave as I do and so you know
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.240]   we've got a link for that I think they gave us a discount that still works so
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.840]   you'll find that on the gift guide really love their cookware comes in a
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.400]   couple different colors one other thing that I think will shock you is we've
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.920]   used it a lot for making fish there's this David Chang salmon recipe that
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.680]   we've made a bunch and I was surprised that frozen fish can be so good
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.280]   especially in the microwave for storing all these recipes for a long long time
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.240]   I've talked about the paprika app it costs money and I suggested it in the
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.080]   past as a gift because I think it's so good but the founder of an app called
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.560]   umami which is another recipe app emailed me and was like I I really think
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.480]   we made an awesome app and you'd be worth checking it out and so I did and
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.000]   it's pretty good we were able to import all of our recipes sort them plan out
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.720]   meals groceries and on top of that it is way way less expensive I think the
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.640]   paprika app across all your devices can cost you you know 50 60 70 dollars and
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.280]   the umami app best I can tell is actually free so big fan of that not
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.040]   really a gift but here's my advice if you could curate a bunch of family
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.320]   recipes if you could take all those old recipes that maybe your mother your
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.920]   grandmother your grandfather have in some sort of probably index cards or
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.960]   book and you could turn them all into a digital recipe library and send all of
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.920]   those recipes to different family members I think it'd be a really cool
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.520]   gift that would be something that really doesn't cost anything but you could just
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.160]   export the file and say hey I've got the entire book of family recipes in an in a
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.960]   format that you can use forever and save digitally so that's an idea for everyone
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:46.920]   device we use a lot is the Coravin wine preserver and we use it because we just
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.760]   don't always want to drink an entire bottle of wine it just lets you pour by
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.040]   the glass out of a bottle without ruining the rest of the wine without
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.640]   needing to finish the bottle of wine that week and it does it by replacing
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   all of the wine with argon gas it's really curbed our feeling like we need
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.040]   to just finish an entire bottle at night and we almost never open the entire
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.160]   bottle unless we have people over on drinks we've been gifted a bunch of
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.080]   different insulated mugs for various reasons and my wife the other day was
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.520]   just saying none of them keep coffee warm like an ember mug and my mom loves
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.960]   her ember mug even though it's broke a few times the customer service has
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.840]   always replaced it so while I wish it never had issues I'm at least happy that
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.520]   they have good you know support but an ember mug makes a great gift they have
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.200]   travel ones and countertop ones I actually think sometimes during the year
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.560]   they're on sale at Costco which also makes me remember that the ninja creamy
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   deluxe is available at Costco and that's where you're gonna get the best deal
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.840]   there I can't promise this is still there but if you're not a Costco member
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.040]   right now there's a deal to get a discounted Costco membership or at least
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.120]   a full price Costco membership with a $45 Costco shop card from Groupon so
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.680]   definitely something to look into for anyone who is looking at Costco stuff
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.120]   but doesn't have a membership on the topic of things to put in that coffee
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.360]   cup there is a product that I have never bought but I've heard great things about
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.000]   and is very expensive but if you need a gift like this the ratio coffee machine
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.640]   basically a machine to do pour over coffee at home it's anywhere from two
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.400]   hundred and fifty dollars all the way up to seven hundred dollars it looks really
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   beautiful and if pour over coffee and automation and beautiful kitchen
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.200]   appliances are something that kind of meet the criteria of what you're looking
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:41.000]   for highly recommend if you need a subscription to coffee trade coffee and
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.200]   Atlas coffee club are two companies that I've heard good things about last thing
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.000]   that I'll share on the drinks because I found this product and I never knew
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.320]   where to share it is a spirit called the Pathfinder and the interesting thing
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.640]   about it is there is no alcohol in it but it's one of the best non-alcoholic
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.240]   spirits I've found and I'd say it's somewhat similar to an Amaro it's just
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.920]   really good and so if that sounds good to you take a look you might be able to
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.000]   find it locally at a handful of stores and is a great option for anyone not
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.160]   drinking this holiday season one more idea for food is doing gifting or doing
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.360]   a hot sauce challenge is something I love I actually went to a party that our
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.600]   previous guest Steph Smith hosted and she had the hot ones kit and did a
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.480]   tasting test you can buy ones from hot ones there are all kinds of products
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.760]   like this online I think we did the tame to insane challenge box goes all the way
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.440]   up to 11 I remember this very distinctly because number 10 is called paint Apple
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.240]   and it is a hot hot sauce and one time because it doesn't have one of those
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.680]   lids that makes it come out in smaller quantities Amy miscalculated and poured
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.000]   a lot of it on her taco and boy it was both comical and I felt bad for her but
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.920]   I still to this day think it's a delicious hot sauce so really loved
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.240]   doing one of these challenge boxes this was another gift for my parents that I
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.000]   never would have expected or asked for and it was a lot of fun but it also
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.520]   creates a fun activity that you can do during the holidays with your family so
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.120]   that stuff food and kitchen okay let's talk clothing and gear it would be hard
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.600]   for me not to start with Viorey gear right now I'm wearing three pieces of it
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.840]   and that was not intentional it just happens to be what I wear all the time
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.960]   I've got a pair of Sunday performance joggers highly recommend I've got a
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.400]   strato tech tee also highly recommend and a panto performance half zip hoodie
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.240]   love all of these products really anything with their dream knit fabric is
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.200]   amazing I was actually at a conference recently after giving someone a hug they
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.440]   said wow this is so soft what is it I was like oh it's Viorey I felt like I
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.000]   was a walking billboard for this company and and I don't even get all of my
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.680]   Viorey clothes for free I actually pay for them I just love them that much and
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.560]   so they've been a long time maybe our longest partner of the show big 20% off
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.440]   discount for anyone that's listening in the gift guide really love them Amy is
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:11.600]   as big of a fan as I am so many great products leggings sports bras shirts
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:18.040]   jackets everything but if you need to dress up while I do often wear the Viorey
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.360]   meta pants as my kind of nice dress pants and they're super comfortable if
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.560]   you do need kind of a fun design dress shirt for someone almost all of my dress
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.640]   shirts are from bonobos they've got all kinds of cool interesting designs some
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.120]   have Tigers some have bunnies some have foxes my kids love kind of picking out
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.720]   something creative so love their shirts and then also love gooder sunglasses
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.600]   they make a great stocking stuffer they're affordable but they're also
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   really well made I've used them for years and almost all environments and
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.600]   because they're not that expensive you don't mind wearing them in the ocean or
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.080]   in the pool and I just really love that about sunglasses I hate owning a really
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.160]   expensive pair of sunglasses that you're worried you're gonna scratch or forget
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.600]   or anything like that and then a new clothing brand to me that my wife asked
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.880]   me to put on this list because she loves it is quince and all their clothes are
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   really classic the exact shirt I think I probably own five to ten of is the
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.440]   Riviera short-sleeve shirt I think it's a great shirt so many different designs
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.620]   they don't go after any extreme trends but they're really high quality they
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.760]   have good manufacturing practices and they're just not as expensive as a lot
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   of other brands and she just got me a really nice cashmere sweater that I'm
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.320]   enjoying a lot this is a great example because there is an Amex offer right now
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.240]   for $40 off $175 they also make great home products I think we use the quince
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.280]   duvet on our bed and it's wonderful so I'll come back to those Amex offers
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.240]   later but I just wanted to flag that when I noticed one of the things in this
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.160]   guide has a special deal it's worth including waterproof Birkenstocks I
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.800]   don't own a pair but I think my wife and our daughter are wearing them all around
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   all the time our kids also really like Crocs I had to look up what these things
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.520]   are called but they have these little gibbets that you can kind of add to your
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   Crocs for fun designs kids love them great stocking stuffer you can of course
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.020]   buy them from Crocs and they have thousands on Amazon as well next is
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.240]   arcade.ai which is a really cool custom jewelry website that my wife sent me and
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.600]   unfortunately because she sent it to me I can't probably find something to
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.940]   surprise her with but for all of you out there if you're looking for a gift for
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.560]   someone and it's in the jewelry area there's some really cool unique stuff on
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.480]   here and then last stance socks always make a great stocking stuffer big fan of
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.760]   their socks of course if you just need regular running socks I like what they
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.720]   sell at Costco the Puma socks there they're super cheap but when it comes to
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.920]   kind of fun unique socks stance does a really great job of making socks that
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.800]   last on the gear side I'm gonna start with the Tortuga backpack and day pack
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.920]   the day pack is a new product of theirs and it is amazing big shout out to the
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   founder of Tortuga who's a listener of the show and helped us design some
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.560]   custom day packs for our trip to Iceland for everyone that came we've got logos
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.120]   on them really really amazing but their core backpack is also fantastic it's a
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.120]   big travel bag that still is a carry-on and it's basically my main bag when I'm
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.920]   going anywhere if I do need a roller board I have an away roller board and a
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   Manos roller board that's a little bigger and if you need a diaper bag
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.400]   there is none better that I've found than what 50/50 gear makes another all
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.440]   the hacks listener who started this company really big fan of their diaper
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:45.240]   bag and we use it all the time just designed both for performance and you
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.440]   know aesthetic but as well as function and then Kuyana makes a travel case
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.040]   that my wife has gifted to a lot of people over the years you can get custom
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.840]   monogrammed their little leather bags they make a great makeup bag next let's
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.560]   talk health and fitness something I've been using for years now when I'm
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   running is the shocks open run Pro headphones I mentioned the air pods
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.760]   earlier I love them for everything except running I love that these shocks
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.860]   headphones are open ear so you can hear things around you cars coming anything
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.920]   like that also when I'm running I really like the Nike slim waist pack I used to
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.080]   use a shoulder band and then my wife got this waist pack and I was like oh that
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.120]   seems silly and then I tried it I was like oh this is much better and so you
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.200]   can't see your phone while you're running but let's be real using your
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.700]   phone while it's on one of those shoulder bands while you're running is
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.040]   not really possible either so I've really enjoyed switching to this along
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.520]   the lines of running the Nike Vaporfly 3 shoes are fantastic race day shoes my
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.760]   speed actually improved pretty noticeably using them but they're not
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.800]   everyday shoes and so when it came to running I switched to the Nike Pegasus
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.960]   41 shoes which I could totally customize online and I think would make
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.600]   a great holiday gift for anyone who needs a pair of running shoes another
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.560]   activity we'd like to do out which was actually a gift for us was stand-up
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.960]   paddleboard so if you live near water anywhere they're great with kids and
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.480]   there are a handful of inflatable ones you can get on Amazon or at Costco then
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.520]   I'm surprised at how often we use them just to kind of go out for an hour
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.360]   paddle around in the Sun winter is probably not the ideal time to use them
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.280]   but maybe it's the ideal time to buy them because they're probably not that
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.080]   popular yet and so I don't know it makes a great gift we have two of them and we
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.160]   go out with the kids probably once a month when it's warm Amy added the Jade
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.200]   Yoga harmony yoga mat which if you want a really high quality yoga mat this is a
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.760]   great one it's actually funny because I have this old crappy yoga mat and I
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.920]   always was like do you really need a nice yoga mat and every now and then
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:59.240]   we'll both do a yoga class together at home and I'm and I'll be like gosh your
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.680]   yoga mats are really nice mine is like chipping apart so really like that yoga
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.320]   mat when she's not using it sometimes I borrow it if you're lifting I've long
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.640]   been a fan of the Bowflex Select Tech adjustable dumbbells it just saves the
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   need to have a whole rack of dumbbells and you can adjust in really tight
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.520]   increments love those for water bottles I feel like we've been gifted every
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.720]   water bottle under the Sun from conferences and companies but we've
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.240]   ended up slowly removing all the non hydro flask water ball bottles and
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.520]   keeping the hydro flask ones so you know that is definitely our house pick for
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.560]   water bottles and then last this is kind of another weird one but within the
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.640]   health and fitness world I think there are a handful of diagnostics that might
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.600]   make sense to give someone so for example high cholesterol runs in our
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:55.960]   family so I gave a lot of people in our family a LP little a blood test I just
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.640]   ordered it up at LabCorp Quest whichever was closer to a lot of people so they
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.040]   knew that it kind of reminds me of how lots of people were giving out 23andme
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.280]   kits back in the day I'm gonna dive into an episode about a lot of different
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.720]   diagnostic scans in the future but some of the interesting things to consider as
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.560]   gifts are getting someone a DEXA scan I did mine at DEXA fit and they have
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.120]   locations all around the country and that was a really cool experience so
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.200]   that would be a cool one not that expensive InstaLab has a longevity panel
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.400]   that's about $300 there's function health there's inside tracker I'll
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.960]   include links to all of these but that's something super interesting I know that
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.200]   some insurances might cover a few of these tests not all of them but it's
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   kind of a weird gift to give someone but it was really really insightful for me
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.640]   to look at all this data scheduling a calcium score test with something that I
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.680]   know a lot of people in my family have done because of the history of
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.600]   cardiovascular disease so that's another one there's the true diagnostic true age
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.520]   score there's a true diagnostic biological age test there's just a lot
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   of interesting things that could make for good gifts for someone you know well
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.240]   enough to you know sign up for a medical treatment or test or diagnostic okay on
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.680]   to the fun stuff let's talk about games I'm a big fan of all kinds of games in
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:25.600]   the past I've talked about box one which is best I could describe kind of like an
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.880]   adventure game meets an escape room for a single player served up in a box like
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.960]   a board game and I loved it and the only thing that I didn't love about it was
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.340]   once you play it there's no replay value so it's built and sold by a company
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.720]   called theory 11 and I happen to meet the guy Jonathan who started this
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   company and runs it and I asked him this year I said hey is there anything cool
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.640]   coming out and I had no idea what he was gonna say but he told me box 2 is coming
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.080]   out now I can't look at the website right now because it's not even been
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   announced but by the time this episode comes out box 2 will be out I 100% will
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.380]   be buying box 2 immediately as soon as it's there or at least giving it to
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.760]   someone as a Christmas gift idea it was so much fun playing box one highly
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.480]   highly recommend theory 11 also sells magic tricks but they also sell the most
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.680]   beautiful playing cards out there in almost every possible design you could
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:28.960]   imagine from Broadway shows to movies to Harry Potter one of the best stocking
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:34.000]   stuffers you can give someone everything from box sets down to a single deck love
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.180]   what theory 11 makes and if anyone in the family or your kids are aspiring to
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.520]   learn magic tricks they have so many high-quality magic products as well a
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.860]   couple small games that are easy to travel with Monopoly deal we play all
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.880]   the time coup we play all the time and a new one that someone brought on our
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.440]   Iceland trip that I didn't get a chance to play but was told is amazing is
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.360]   Illamat it's a card game I'm excited to test it out I bought it but I have not
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.040]   played it yet for anyone that loves games I've really enjoyed having a
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.760]   subscription to games magazine each month I get kind of a magazine with a
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.240]   bunch of everything from word puzzles to other riddles and games another puzzle
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   that I think is fun as a stocking suffer is called Hino Maru it's a Japanese flag
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.840]   puzzle and I'm telling you it's so simple in its design and it is so
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.640]   difficult I've been trying to solve it for the better part of a few months I
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.000]   haven't sat down for hours and hours but every time I have 15 minutes I take it
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.640]   out and try to figure it out and it's both difficult and simple and easy and
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   inexpensive I'll link to that it's really great and then I've recently
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:48.800]   gotten excited watching these different puzzle boxes get played so there's a guy
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.160]   named Chris Ramsey that has a YouTube channel where he tries to solve all of
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.480]   them and records himself doing it and most of them are pretty expensive and so
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.680]   I haven't really wanted to throw down hundreds of dollars for a puzzle as much
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.200]   as watching him do them makes me want more and more of them if anything I want
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.640]   to start kind of a puzzle renting service because once you solve it
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.160]   there's not a lot of use for it but this company Puzzle Potato had an item on
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.880]   Kickstarter which was called the Tesla puzzle and I thought well this one's
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.920]   less expensive than most let's support them I bought it it came it was amazing
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   awesome gift idea under $100 highly highly recommend for anyone who likes
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.480]   puzzles and challenges and escape room style things but that can be done at
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.440]   home and the only unfortunate thing is now that I've done it I can't solve it
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.480]   again because I already know the answers so that's gonna become a gift for
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.720]   someone else this year finally this isn't really a game but I really enjoyed
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.920]   trying to learn the art or skill of lock picking not for any nefarious reasons
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.360]   but just because mechanically it's very difficult even though you know how it
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.040]   works and so one cool thing that you could give to anyone who might be
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.920]   interested is a little lock picking kit you can actually see how locks work a
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.480]   lot of them come with kind of clear locks that you can look into so that you
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   can see how the process works obviously I wouldn't give this gift to anyone with
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.800]   criminal tendencies but as a just a skill to pick up and practice it's
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   really interesting two more categories on kids I want to share one of my
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.520]   favorites which every time I'm using it another parent sees it and says what is
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.360]   that where do I get that and that's the ooky kids learner skateboard it's
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.280]   basically a skateboard that can help someone progress from probably the age
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:39.040]   of 18 months two years old all the way up to five or six or seven and it's just
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.360]   been really awesome to watch our girls learn how to balance and learn how to
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.520]   lean and they've really enjoyed it these kids gifts are gonna go all over the
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.560]   place but another one is the Melissa and Doug pizza play set we've got a lot of
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.260]   these little like play sets around the house but for some reason the pizza one
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.480]   just seems to be the most popular so really like it you can get it at Target
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.040]   another thing that's been hugely popular in our house is a Tony box I talked
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.840]   about it a while ago because not only can you buy characters that sit on top
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.320]   of this box that's basically a speaker that's connected to the internet and
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.520]   plays songs and stories but you can record your own custom stories in a past
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.480]   episode I talked about how I used AI to create stories in my own voice that I
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.720]   generated which had GPT I've heard some good feedback also about the Yoto which
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.780]   is a alternative to the Tony it's nice to have a thing that's kind of like
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.720]   watching shows for kids that isn't screen time another one that we actually
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.200]   had to wait for a while on was a nugget which is basically a set of I don't know
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.640]   like cushions that you can use to build forts that you can use to create kind of
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:51.200]   sitting area you could use as a makeshift bed for a sleepover it's really
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.880]   great another really cool thing we saw at Costco for kids that could be a fun
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.680]   holiday gift is this really cool Lego table that kind of pops open stores all
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.280]   these Legos closes has a whole Lego surface on top so that was one that I
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.100]   was like gosh we have something similar but I really want this one so that's a
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.680]   good one for kind of fun stocking stuffers jellycat stuffed animals are a
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.040]   big hit in our house as well as coloring books and there's actually a cool
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.600]   coloring book kit that I'll link to there's nothing unique about it other
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.040]   than the markers are all kind of built into it for anyone who has really young
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.720]   kids or needs a gift for someone with young kids I love every subscription or
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.760]   just a gift they make these Montessori toys and kits so for every kind of three
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.800]   months or four months of age they have a different kit that they send with
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.440]   everything from books to an instruction guide to a bunch of different toys and
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   learning activities that we've really loved another thing that we don't yet
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.920]   own but I really want and I don't have a particular brand to recommend is a
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.520]   Swedish ladder which is kind of like a indoor gym for kids that you can mount
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.840]   on the wall some of them are freestanding and if you just search for
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.480]   it on Amazon there are a bunch of different ones but this is something
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.760]   that if we had the right space in the house we would probably definitely have
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.600]   it right now we do not but it's something that I think our kids would
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.160]   love and would be a really awesome thing to get them that is on the list and has
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.760]   been for a while we just don't have a place to put it and then I probably
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.080]   should have mentioned this in the game section but I'm not gonna go through all
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.280]   the kids games there's so many but I'm gonna flag one and it's not a
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.240]   particularly fun game for adults but the only reason I'll share it is because
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.280]   there are not a lot of games that are easy to play with a very young kid 18 to
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.200]   36 months but there's this game called monkey around which basically is a
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.000]   beanbag banana and each card just tells you something to do with it and our kids
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.760]   really loved it at that age when we were trying to you know play a board game
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   with them and they were just weren't ready for it I would recommend the game
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.640]   first orchard which was a good board game to kind of start to teach kids
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.720]   about games but man this monkey around game they just loved for for I guess all
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.800]   the obvious reasons but all they do is here's a banana balance it on your head
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.280]   hop around with the banana toss it hold it under your legs that kind of stuff
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:21.560]   last is the books and learning section a few things here so if you want to learn
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.160]   about diving down rabbit holes on the internet
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.080]   Steph Smith's course that we talked about in my episode with her there's
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.280]   still a $200 discount for her course called internet pipes if you want to
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.360]   learn really anything huge fan of master class we've partnered with them for a
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.840]   long time I've given it as multiple gifts there's gonna be a holiday promo
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.560]   on the gift guide so I just think it's a really excellent gift especially if you
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.080]   need a last-minute idea because you can buy it online but even if you don't
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.760]   there's so many different things that really anyone can learn from someone
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.280]   wants to dial in their credit card game you could obviously get them a copy of
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   my credit card tool and then last one that we've given to I think every family
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:09.000]   member is story worth which is basically a book that gets built over the year so
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.480]   you send all these prompts to someone in your family you know a parent a
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.920]   grandparent they answer these emails and then at the end of the year all of the
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.860]   email replies get packaged up into a book so it might be something like tell
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.920]   me about your first date tell me about your first job what was your childhood
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.680]   like where did you live and you start to build these amazing stories from your
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.120]   family that you can pass down from generation to generation last on books
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.160]   there are so many books that different guests we've interviewed this year have
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.700]   talked about I'm just gonna put the full list of all the book recommendations in
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.920]   the gift guide again all the hacks comm slash gifts instead of just reading the
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.600]   name of all the books right now so I hope that gift guide was helpful but
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.680]   what I think is even more helpful is saving money on all the gifts you're
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.080]   buying whether they're on the list or not and so I want to talk about a
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.000]   handful of the ways I make sure I'm always getting the best deal so first
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.400]   off there are a few sale periods like Black Friday cyber Monday always a good
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.240]   time to consider what you're buying but do make sure that those sales are real
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.160]   and so I always like to install the browser extension keepa which when
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.560]   you're browsing anything on Amazon you can look down and see if that price has
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.740]   changed over time so right now I'm trying to find a product that has a good
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.360]   history I'm looking at the ooky skateboard and I'm seeing that right now
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:37.720]   it's $139 but prior to like October 5th it was always $120 and it's dropped a
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.000]   handful of days since then so that tells me that 139 maybe is the new price and
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.520]   119 is maybe the the previous price but if on side Black Friday they end up
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:54.120]   saying oh it's on sale and they drop it to 135 you know it might not really be a
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.280]   sale I have seen a ton of times where people increase the base price discount
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.000]   it and it looks like a big sale but it's not actually that much cheaper than it
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.200]   normally is so the keepa browser extensions really helpful to be able to
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.160]   track those prices now once you've decided that you want to buy something
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.960]   and it's a good price I want to make sure that I can get cash back if
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.760]   possible and so I like to go to cash back monitor and that gives you a
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.000]   dashboard of all of the different places you can get cash back so for example
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.360]   let's take Nike let's say you want to buy those Pegasus 41 shoes that I
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.260]   mentioned which is actually a process that I went through when I bought them
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.800]   and you can see that you can get anywhere from you know one to two miles
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:39.200]   per dollar with airlines you can get you know two credit card points sometimes
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.000]   there's bonuses so one of the credit card portals right now is at 15 points
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.160]   per dollar but you can also just get cash back so you know Rakuten's at 8%
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   back top cash backs at 10% and this stuff changes all the time so I think
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.520]   going on to cash back monitor seeing what kind of deals are there is
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.760]   interesting but also some of these cash back portals have their own promotions
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.880]   and so as of recording this I'm not sure if these will still be around when this
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.080]   episode comes out but for anyone who is subscribed to the all the hacks
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.520]   newsletter I will have sent them all around to everyone before they expire if
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.240]   you're not all thehacks.com/email to get on for the next time but all the
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.960]   airline shopping portals American Delta Southwest Alaska and United all have
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.440]   promos going on right now where if you spend a certain amount through the
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.920]   portal they'll give you a lot of bonus miles and those bonuses end up being
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.040]   somewhere in the three to seven percent back range and that's primarily my
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.520]   calculations looking at giftcards.com which I'll come back to but I'm always
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.960]   looking at ways to get cash back when I'm shopping online if there's a bonus
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:52.040]   at an airline portal that could make sense if not I'm almost just focusing on
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.980]   Rakuten because you not only get cash back but you can convert that cash back
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.280]   to Amex points if you want and with a referral which I'll put in the gift
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.080]   guide you can usually get a free 30 to 40 dollars with your first purchase so
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:10.400]   99% of all my shopping online I'm doing Rakuten but every now and then I'll go
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.040]   to cashback monitor and I'll see oh Rakuten might be 3% and there's some
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.680]   promo going on that's 20% back from some other portal now there are always some
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.080]   terms sometimes they're pretty straightforward and it's just this is
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.320]   the deal and sometimes it says well it only applies in this certain area or a
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.320]   maximum purchase amount of this so definitely look at those terms but I've
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:38.080]   earned probably hundreds maybe thousands of dollars in cash back from optimizing
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.960]   these cash back portals a new one that I'm exploring is called kudos and the
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.160]   way it works is a little bit more confusing but if you load your credit
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.840]   cards into it and they multiply your credit card rewards so it looks like
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:58.080]   according to them you can get up to 25% back this must be a startup that's
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   funded by some kind of venture capital because I don't see how you could get 25
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.120]   percent back sustainably so I'll put my referral link in there if you want to
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.480]   get a head start to some of that cash back and play around with it but those
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.800]   are kind of a couple of the ways I'm getting cash back when I'm buying but
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.040]   that's not it so I want the best price I want to get the most cash back but when
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.280]   it comes time to pay for it yes ideally you're using the right card but even
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.240]   better than using the right credit card is oftentimes using a gift card and so
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.940]   what I'll do is I'll go online and see if I can find a gift card for that
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:39.440]   merchant that might actually be cheaper than actually using a credit card when
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.640]   you factor in all the points and everything like that so a few options
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.400]   here so one obviously you could go buy the gift cards at a store if there's a
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.840]   sale a lot of times on the weekends for whatever reason Kroger Safeway have been
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.280]   having deals where you earn a lot of extra points or discounts for buying
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.640]   gift cards so that's one option Costco is known to have a bunch of gift cards
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.160]   on sale but they usually have limits so I know recently you could get uber gift
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.760]   cards for $75 for $100 in value or DoorDash and Instacart for $80 for
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:16.160]   $100 of value they also regularly have $500 of Southwest credit for $430 so a
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.840]   lot of ways to buy them yourself but in limited quantities and only when they
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.720]   happen to be on sale and in stock though Costco's are available on their website
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.640]   but there are also a few apps that I use regularly to find gift cards and so one
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.200]   of them is the Pepper app so you can go to GoPepper.com or you could just search
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.600]   for Pepper in the App Store and the way it works is you can buy gift cards at
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.480]   whatever value you want and earn Pepper points I mentioned this in my episode
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.800]   with Kevin Rose and the points you earn could be anywhere from like the
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.840]   equivalent of 4x points which is about 4% cash back but sometimes they boost it
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.880]   and I've gotten Amazon gift cards for 14x points which is effectively 14%
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.900]   cash back which is way better than using my Amazon card to go and buy anything on
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:10.440]   Amazon because that's maximum getting me 5 maybe 6% if you're gonna delay your
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.160]   shipping and have the right card to do that so these gift cards go on sale all
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.000]   the time so it's hard to know when you're gonna get the best deal on what
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.080]   but right now I'm looking and if you wanted to buy Lowe's gift cards you can
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:30.320]   get 15% off or 15x points Nike's at 15 Kohl's is at 16 and so every day the
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.780]   deals change but there's a lot of great opportunity if you're gonna spend $200
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:39.320]   make sure you use someone's referral code because you get an extra $20 mine
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.520]   is 612-342 it's not the normal thing where you use a name or a link it's just
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.520]   a six digit number so that's one option another option is an app called Flues
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.880]   you can find it in the App Store and they basically also let you just buy
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.920]   gift cards they're usually not at that big of a discount as I've seen when
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:05.900]   Pepper app puts things on sale but an example right now I'll get to that why
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.720]   we were making this purchase but we're making a purchase on Hannah Anderson to
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:16.200]   buy some Christmas pajamas and you could earn up to 5% back so you go and purchase
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.320]   a gift card you put in the exact amount you want even to the scent and you
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.340]   basically pay for the gift card and then you just get some cash back that I think
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.720]   you could just use for another gift card so if you can't find as good of a deal
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.920]   in Pepper you might be able to find it in the Flues app and even if there's not
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.200]   a bonus sometimes it's still a great deal so I'll mention in a few minutes
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.480]   why we were shopping on Hannah Anderson to buy holiday pajamas and they had a
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.200]   5x points which is basically 5% off and there was no other deal for Hannah
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.880]   Anderson so that was way better than me using a card that would probably just
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   get 2% back or 2 points per dollar another interesting option is giftcards.com
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.040]   and the reason it's interesting is because it's in a lot of the shopping
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.960]   portals so I know on Rakuten you get two and a half percent back on purchases up
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.280]   to $2,000 but if you stack it with a lot of those airline deals that are
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.180]   happening in the airline shopping portals then you can get three and a
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.400]   half to seven percent back so there could be some really good deals they
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.200]   also have their own rewards program so when you end up buying something on
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.800]   giftcards.com you can stack the cash back with whatever cash back portal or
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.120]   Rakuten you're using you can stack the giftcard.com rewards and on top of that
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.560]   you can also layer on your credit card rewards depending on those factors and
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.240]   what you see on an app like Pepper it may or may not be a good deal but it's
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.120]   at least an option especially with some of these holiday shopping portal bonuses
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.980]   there are some going on now and there will inevitably be more going on in the
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.280]   future now one interesting thing I've learned as I dug into all of this
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.800]   giftcard buying and selling marketplace is that a lot of people who buy these
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.040]   gift cards are turning around and reselling them so there's a pretty
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.840]   active marketplace for buying and selling gift cards I might actually do
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.880]   an entire episode on that and bring on someone I've gotten to know who runs one
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.640]   of them but if you are interested and this is kind of a long shot might be
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.600]   relevant to two or three of you but if anyone's making very very large
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:20.720]   purchases let's call it in the probably 10,000 plus a year range at a major
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:26.880]   merchant whether that's Amazon Best Buy Apple uber door - instacart there is an
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.600]   opportunity to actually buy those gift cards wholesale in bulk and I'm happy to
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:37.040]   try to help make that happen for anyone that's interested but you know but most
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   of these wholesalers are really not interested unless you're in the kind of
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.800]   five-figure plus range otherwise it's just easier for you to go buy them from
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:49.200]   an app like pepper or giftcards.com or at Costco which is really the source of
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.560]   them all in the first place but the short answer is almost every online
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.160]   retailer it is a better deal to pay with a gift card that you buy at a discount
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.560]   than it is to pay with your credit card. The last big one is card-linked offers
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.280]   and so almost every credit card platform from every major issuer has a set of
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.600]   offers where from time to time there are things like get $40 off $100 get 10% off
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.880]   up to $200 at so many different retailers and I went back over time I
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.680]   mentioned this when I talked about quints earlier because there was an Amex offer
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.960]   for $40 off $175 purchase I actually went through Amex and Chase and looked
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:35.880]   at the lifetime dollars that I've earned from all of these card-linked offers and
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:42.360]   for me personally across my and Amy's cards it's twenty two hundred seventy
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:48.160]   dollars and fifty two cents which is actually pretty astonishing because that
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.000]   makes up for a lot of the annual fees that I've paid on a lot of these cards
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.360]   and it's been on things like Delta, Dropbox, Lovevery, Hydroflask, quints so
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.560]   absolutely worth especially right before the holiday season or anytime you're
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.840]   doing a lot of shopping to just go online and look at your cards website
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.080]   and see what deals are there sometimes there's nothing relevant sometimes
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.040]   there's a ton of relevant stuff that wraps up most of the ways I save money
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.760]   when I shop if you go back and listen episode 195 it was 50 ways I earned more
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.280]   points without spending more there are a few more tactics that were in that
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.440]   episode that I'm not going to necessarily cover right here but
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.680]   hopefully I just gave you a bunch of gift ideas and ways to save money on
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.800]   those gifts now since I know you're all thinking hmm that was so valuable what
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.320]   gift should I give Chris for the holidays don't worry I'm not asking you
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.560]   to spend money and send me anything but I do have one gift that won't cost you
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.200]   anything and is so easy that I'll ask for and it's just if you could pick your
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.360]   favorite episode of the podcast or maybe it's a few different ones and share them
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.840]   or the podcast in general with anyone and everyone you think might enjoy it or
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.800]   get value from it it would really mean the world to me if you want to go above
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.600]   and beyond of course you could share the newsletter leave a rating and review but
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.800]   my main ask this year if you've gotten any value out of the show is to just
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.680]   share it with someone thank you so much in advance for that finally as I
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.760]   mentioned I want to wrap up and just share some of the holiday traditions
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.440]   that we have and I didn't bite anyone with a fun holiday tradition that they'd
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.400]   like to share to send an email podcast at all the hacks calm I'd love to
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.760]   collect them all and maybe find a place or a time to share them back with people
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.920]   so the first one I'll talk about is that on one side of our family we started
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.480]   doing a kind of everyone picks one person and gets one really nice gift and
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.080]   we actually evolved it to just be each couple so we might draw you know a
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.200]   sibling or a parent and everyone goes and tries to find something really nice
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.280]   and meaningful instead of trying to find a bunch of small gifts so for example
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.080]   one of them one year was an uni pizza oven and so we were able to kind of go a
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.400]   little bit above and beyond and get something really interesting for one
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.200]   member of the family and then that person had another person kind of like a
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.640]   white elephant except serious gifts instead of fun gifts so that was one
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:11.320]   thing we did each year everyone gets an ornament in our family and so our tree
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.860]   is covered with all these different unique ornaments sometimes it's related
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.720]   to something we did that year for example one year I was really into
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.200]   fantasy football and so Amy got me a fantasy football ornament or it might be
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.800]   from a trip we took so we have a very personalized set of ornaments on the
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:33.680]   tree as I mentioned earlier we buy matching pajamas usually from Hannah
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.280]   Anderson both for Christmas morning and to take photos which has been a fun
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.480]   tradition we actually try not just to buy gifts for our family but for other
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.920]   people who don't have them and we've tried to incorporate the girls in this
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.480]   process and sometimes local businesses or our employers have driven this other
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:55.960]   times we drive it ourselves and we'll go and say take a list of ten people and
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:02.080]   we'll go to Target and we'll have the girls help us pick out gifts for a bunch
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.980]   of kids or adults and on that day it's not about anything for us it's about for
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.880]   someone else so we like to try to incorporate some form of giving
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   especially with the kids so that they understand that you know there are a lot
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.360]   of people that don't have what they have and they get to experience what it's
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.120]   like to try to provide for others last year we actually did a big charity
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.320]   fundraiser on the podcast as you all know we ended up funding two entire
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:33.280]   water projects in Cambodia and based on the update I just recently got they
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.840]   finished all the permits partners supplies and over the next six months
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.200]   they're actually gonna be doing construction so stay tuned there
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.880]   another one is anytime a toy is introduced to our house we try to rotate
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:48.620]   another toy out and either give that toy away or put it in storage so there just
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.720]   aren't toys everywhere it turns out that if you take a toy and put it in a closet
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.760]   for six months and give it to your kids again it almost feels like a new toy so
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.960]   that's another great hack and then each year we tried to make a tradition out of
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.240]   doing a cookie decorating party so we'll bake a lot of holiday cookies and invite
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.620]   friends and family over using the Nick Gray cocktail party formula which if you
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:18.840]   didn't listen to that episode go back and check it out and invite people over
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.720]   and you can decorate cookies and leave with a little bag of cookies so I
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.440]   secretly want to evolve that to a gingerbread house making party but the
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.280]   sheer quantity of gingerbread that needs to be made is just not something that
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.920]   we're ready to do right now so I think those are most of the traditions I'm
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:40.720]   always open to more again share them podcast at all the hacks comm finally
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.840]   reminder that links to all the products and gifts and ideas I mentioned
