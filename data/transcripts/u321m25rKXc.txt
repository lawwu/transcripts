[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   I hope the Kiev airport will open soon, then it will be easier to fly in.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.460]   Yes, I think that the war will end and President Trump may be the first leader to travel here
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.460]   by airplane.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.620]   I think it would be symbolic by airplane.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.660]   Again, January 25th, around that date, right?
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.940]   Flying in, meeting the Air Force One.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.460]   That would be cool.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.980]   There is a perception of corruption.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.900]   People like Donald Trump and Elon Musk really care about fighting corruption.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.700]   What can you say to them to gain their trust that the money is going towards this fight
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420]   for freedom, towards the war effort?
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.180]   In most cases, we did not receive money, we received weapons.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.460]   And where we saw risks that something could be a weapon, we would slap everyone on the
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460]   wrist.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.340]   Believe me, this is not only about Ukraine, on the supply chain, everywhere.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.900]   There are some or other people and companies who want to make money because everyone makes
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.020]   money on the war.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.800]   We did not profit from the war.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.820]   If we found someone, believe me, we slapped everyone on the wrist.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.280]   And we did that, we did that, and we will continue to do so because to this day, when
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.580]   someone says that Ukraine was selling weapons, and by the way, Russia was the one pushing
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.500]   this narrative, we always responded.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.880]   Our soldiers would kill such people with their own hands without any trial.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.820]   Do you honestly think anyone could steal weapons by the truckload when we ourselves don't
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.460]   have enough on the front lines?
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.420]   And yet, we have to provide proof to defend ourselves because when there's an abundance
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.340]   of such misinformation, distrust starts to grow.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.340]   And you're right.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.000]   People listen to various media outlets, see this, and lose faith in you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.860]   In the end, you lose trust.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.900]   And with it, you lose support.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.260]   Therefore, believe me, we are fighting more against disinformation than against particular
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:17.180]   cases, although I still emphasize once again, at the everyday level, such things are still
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180]   important.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.420]   We catch these, these people, and we fight them.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.620]   As if Putin wants to sit down and talk, but Ukraine does not.
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.620]   This is not true.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.260]   I think that, yes, he is, in fact, ready to talk.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.420]   Did you talk to him?
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.980]   On the phone or what?
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.440]   How do you normally talk to him?
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   I don't know.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   Normally by the sea.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.540]   The same as with you.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.660]   He invites you to the sea with me.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.660]   Just the three of us.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.660]   No, no.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.940]   One of us may drown.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940]   Who?
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.940]   Are you good at swimming?
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.940]   Yes, I am a good swimmer.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.940]   You're a good swimmer.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.140]   Well, if you think that the president of a country is completely crazy, it is really
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220]   hard to come to an agreement with him.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.260]   You have to look at him as a serious person who loves his country and loves the people
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.300]   in his country.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.820]   Who are you talking about now?
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.220]   Who loves his country?
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.380]   Putin.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.580]   Do you think he doesn't love his country?
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.940]   No.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940]   What is his country?
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.520]   He happened to consider Ukraine his country.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.180]   What is his country?
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.660]   When do you think there will be presidential elections in Ukraine?
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.940]   The following is a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.300]   It was an intense, raw, and heartfelt conversation, my goal for which was to understand and to
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.780]   do all I can to push for peace.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.460]   Please allow me to say a few words, first about language, then about the president,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.020]   and finally about history.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.460]   Please skip ahead straight to our conversation if you like.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.660]   We spoke in a mix of languages, continuously switching from Ukrainian to Russian to English.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.940]   Although the interpreter was barely hanging on, it was indeed, in many ways, a wild ride
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.500]   of a conversation.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.660]   As the president said, the first of many, "Language, like many other things in a time
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.300]   of war, is a big deal.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.380]   We had a choice, speak in Russian, Ukrainian, or English.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.780]   The president does speak some English, but he's far from fluent in it, and I sadly don't
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.820]   speak Ukrainian, yet.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.620]   So Russian is the only common language we are both fluent in.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.820]   In case you don't know, the Russian language is one that the president speaks fluently
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.140]   and was his primary language for most of his life.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.900]   It's the language I also speak fluently, to the degree I speak any language fluently,
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.380]   as does a large fraction of the Ukrainian population.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.700]   So the most dynamic and powerful conversation between us would be in Russian, without an
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.460]   interpreter, who, in this case, added about a 2-3 second delay, and frankly, translated
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.340]   partially and poorly, for me at least, taking away my ability to feel the humor, the wit,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.900]   the brilliance, the pain, the anger, the humanity of the person sitting before me, that I could
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.380]   clearly feel when he was speaking fluently in the language I understand, Russian.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.700]   But all that said, war changes everything.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.500]   The Ukrainian language has become a symbol of the Ukrainian people's fight for freedom
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.060]   and independence.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.500]   So we had a difficult choice of three languages.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.700]   And faced with that choice, we said yes, to all three, to the consternation and dismay
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.020]   of the translators.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.940]   We make captions and voice-over audio tracks available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.460]   so you can listen either to a version that is all one language, or to the original mixed
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.780]   language version with subtitles in your preferred language.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.900]   The default is English over dub.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.460]   On YouTube, you can switch between language audio tracks by clicking the settings gear
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.820]   icon, then clicking audio track, and then selecting the language you prefer, English,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.500]   Ukrainian, Russian.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.540]   To listen to the original mixed language version, please select the English UK audio track.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.080]   Big thank you to Eleven Labs for their help with overdubbing using a mix of AI and humans.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.140]   We will continue to explore how to break down the barriers that language creates, with AI
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.660]   and otherwise.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.920]   This is a difficult but important endeavor.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.740]   Language, after all, is much more than a cold sequence of facts and logic statements.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.020]   There are words, when spoken in the right sequence and at the right time, that can shake
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:12.900]   the world and turn the ties of history, that can start and end wars.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   Great leaders can find those words, and great translators can help these words reverberate
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.740]   to the outskirts of a divided civilization.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.460]   On another note, let me say that President Zelensky is a truly remarkable person, and
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.020]   a historic figure.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.100]   I say this as somebody who deeply understands the geopolitical complexity and history of
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.260]   the region.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.900]   I am from this region.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.900]   My parents were both born in Ukraine, Kiev and Kharkiv, both my grandfathers too.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:53.220]   I was born in Tajikistan, and lived for a time there, then in Kiev, then Moscow, then
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.540]   United States.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:03.020]   And while I am now, for almost 30 years, and to the day I die, am a proud American, my
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:09.260]   family roots grow deep in the soil of nations that comprised the Soviet Union, including
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.020]   Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Tajikistan.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.900]   I have gotten to know and have spoken for hours with members of the President's team
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.700]   and people close to him.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.660]   I spoke to hundreds of Ukrainians since 2022, including soldiers, civilians, politicians,
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.380]   artists, religious leaders, journalists, economists, historians, and technologists.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.980]   I listened to hundreds of hours of programs that both support and criticize the President,
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.620]   in Ukraine, in Russia, in the United States.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.780]   I've read countless books about this war, and the long arc of history that led up to
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.780]   it.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:52.500]   If forced to recommend two, at this moment, I would say the Russo-Ukrainian War by Serhii
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:00.260]   Plohi, and The Showman by Simon Shuster, which is a good personal behind-the-scenes biography
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.820]   of the President, focused on 2022.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.260]   But there are many, many more.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:13.340]   This is why I can comfortably say that he is a truly singular and remarkable human being.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.580]   It was an honor and pleasure to talk with him on and off the mic.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:26.140]   Now, it is true that I plan to travel to Moscow and to speak with President Vladimir Putin.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.860]   And I hope to be back in Kiev as well, as President Zelensky said this was our first
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.860]   of many more meetings.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.340]   In all these cases, I seek to do my small part in pushing for peace.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.740]   And in doing all this, I'm deeply grateful for the trust people have given me on all
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.700]   sides.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.600]   For the people attacking me, sometimes lying about me, for the critics in the stands, chanting
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.300]   the latest slogans of the mass hysteria machine like the sheep and animal farm.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.360]   I love you too.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.540]   And I assure you that drawing lines between good and evil on a world map is much easier
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:14.260]   than seeing that line between good and evil in every human being, including you and me.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.940]   This is what I try to do.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.200]   I'm simply a human being who seeks to find and surface the humanity in others.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:30.820]   And as I've said, no amount of money, fame, power, access, can buy my opinion or my integrity.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.340]   Now, finally, please allow me to briefly overview some history to give background for several
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.100]   topics that President Zelensky references in this conversation.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.460]   I recommend my conversation with Sergei Plohy and many others about the history of the region.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:52.620]   And here, let me start with 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence and the Soviet Union
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.500]   collapsed.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.960]   From this point on, Russia-Ukraine relations were defined in large part by whether Ukraine
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.180]   aligned more with Russia or with the West, meaning Europe, United States, NATO, and so
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.180]   on.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:14.100]   In 2004, with the Orange Revolution, a pro-Western candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, became president.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:22.300]   In 2010, it went the other way, a pro-Russia candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, became president.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:28.700]   The internal tensions grew, and in 2013, Euromaidan protests broke out over Yanukovych's decision
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.420]   to suspend talks with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.780]   This set forward a chain of important events in 2014.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.980]   On the politics front, Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, leading to the election
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.740]   of a pro-Western president.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:52.460]   Also in 2014, on the war front, Russia annexed Crimea and war broke out in the Donbass region
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:58.700]   of eastern Ukraine, which eventually killed over 14,000 people and continued all the way
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:08.300]   to 2022, when, on February 24, 2022, Russian forces initiated a full-scale invasion of
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.980]   Ukraine.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.860]   This is when the world started to really pay attention.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.940]   Now some history of peace talks.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:22.100]   Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidency in 2019, and he discusses in this conversation the
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:27.980]   ceasefire agreements he made with Vladimir Putin in 2019, which was one of many attempts
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:35.820]   at peace, from the two Minsk agreements in 2014 and 2015 to a series of ceasefire agreements
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:43.740]   in 2018, 2019, and 2020, all of which failed, in part or in whole.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.540]   All this shows just how difficult ceasefire and peace negotiations are, but they are not
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.760]   impossible.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.740]   It is always worth trying, over and over again, to find the path to peace.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.980]   I believe that Presidents Zelensky, Putin, and Trump should meet soon after January 20th
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:08.580]   this year and give everything they got to negotiate a ceasefire and security guarantees
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.000]   that pave the way for long-lasting peace.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.460]   We discussed several ideas for this in this conversation.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.660]   As I said, this was one of my main goals here, to push for peace.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:27.540]   This trip to Kiev and this conversation was a truly special moment for me in my life.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.740]   It is one I will never forget, so to reflect, I say a few more words and answer some questions
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.780]   at the very end if you like to listen, but here, let me say thank you to everyone for
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.820]   your support over the years.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.760]   It means the world.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.260]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and now, dear friends, here's the President of Ukraine,
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.420]   Volodymyr Zelensky.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.060]   If we can explain why the Ukrainian language is very important, our conversation will be
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.340]   most effective and impactful if we speak in Russian.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.740]   I speak Russian perfectly, of course, and I understand everything you are talking about.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.700]   However, I can't respond in Russian the entire interview.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.900]   It's because this is how it is today.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.120]   I am not making anything up.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.820]   You can see it all for yourself.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.540]   You can feel and hear it.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.100]   Today there were 73 missile attacks against us, and people were killed.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.280]   There were over 100 drones today, and this is a daily occurrence.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.420]   The people who attack us, they speak Russian.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.980]   They attack people who were only recently told that this was actually in defense of
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:44.300]   Russian-speaking people, and this is why I respect neither the leader or director of
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.460]   today's Russia, nor the people.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:54.980]   I just, that's it, and I don't think that you can just pretend that nothing is happening
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:02.140]   and give Putin a pass once again for saying that we are one people, that we speak one
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.580]   language, et cetera.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.420]   They speak the language of weapons.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:13.060]   That is a fact, and we are peaceful people, peaceful people who want to protect themselves
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.020]   and defend their freedom and their human choice.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:28.460]   You know, at the beginning of the war, I addressed Russians in Russian.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.940]   Zero effect.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.820]   They're mute.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.820]   They do not listen.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.740]   They did not listen.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   Some are afraid.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.740]   Some have other issues.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   They have different reasons.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.860]   It's like when a person is drowning, drowning, and people walk by because they can't hear
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.340]   them, and someone walks on by crying, afraid to save them.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.780]   It doesn't change anything for the one drowning.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.980]   They need someone to help them.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.980]   This is why I honestly despise these people, as they are deaf.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.220]   They began the occupation in the supposed defense of the Russian language, and that's
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.140]   why, with all due respect, I would like to give an interview in Ukrainian.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.420]   This is very important to me.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:22.020]   If there are some points that you want me to explain in Russian, I can certainly do
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.020]   that.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.900]   I can certainly occasionally speak Russian, but in general, no.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:34.980]   I'm not sure that you will understand me completely despite your Ukrainian roots.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.660]   You are a citizen of the United States, right?
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.140]   Yes.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:46.180]   That's why I'm surprised that you don't understand.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.900]   Well, it was a long time ago.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.060]   I understand that it was a long time ago.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.340]   Moreover, a lot has changed.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.900]   A lot has changed.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.660]   If I may please allow me to say this in Russian, yes, many things have changed, but I have
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.860]   hope.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.900]   I hope that today many Russians will hear this, that Vladimir Putin will hear this,
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.220]   that the American President Donald Trump and the American people will hear this, that everyone
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.660]   will hear this.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:23.740]   And yes, Ukrainian language is important symbolically, but what is also important is that we understand
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.740]   each other well.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.740]   For Donald Trump?
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.740]   Yes.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.140]   Is it important for Donald Trump whether I speak Russian or not?
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.140]   Yes.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.100]   Because unfortunately, and it hurts to admit, but I cannot speak or understand Ukrainian
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.100]   yet.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:40.580]   So your wit, dynamism, and your humanity will not come through as well and as quickly.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.320]   Remember, I need to wait for two to three seconds to hear it.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.420]   You have a great sense of humor, great stories.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.700]   With an interpreter translating, I simply won't see this, but I understand that it's
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.700]   painful.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.740]   Another reason is that I hoped we could show that even though it is sometimes said that
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740]   Russian is banned in Ukraine.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740]   This is not true.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.720]   I'm speaking Russian now, right?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.180]   We have people who speak Russian.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.820]   This is not true, really, it's not.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.780]   It's really not true.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.580]   We disrespect Russian now because of Russians.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.580]   That's all.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:24.460]   When they were saving Russian speakers, they killed Russian speakers, many people who actually,
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.380]   many of whom are in the East, right?
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.820]   In the East, they live, lived in the East.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.740]   They destroyed their houses, destroyed their lives.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.780]   It's not a rhetorical thing.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.460]   It's not all talk and blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.260]   I don't have time for blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.260]   Yes.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.540]   So it's a very, very, very important and sensitive moment.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   The message is that we are not one nation.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.660]   We are not, you know, the same country.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.380]   We're different countries.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:19:00.100]   Yes, different countries, and I think what is most important is what we're talking about.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.380]   Not how.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.380]   We're speaking about it.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.380]   This is what I think.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.620]   You're a smart guy.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.460]   So you have a lot of experience in dialogue of this kind.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.300]   That's why I think you will, you will understand me.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:21.820]   I, anyway, I think it is far better for Donald Trump to hear my English, not my Russian.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.220]   Your English is much better than my Ukrainian.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.860]   You're getting better and better.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.860]   That's true.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.820]   I'm a very honest guy.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.260]   That's why I will be very honest with you.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.900]   Your Ukrainian is not very good, but we will, but we will work on it.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.900]   Yes.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   I have many flaws.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.060]   That's one of them.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.780]   Sometimes I can speak English.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.580]   As I understand, we can be very flexible, right?
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.580]   Very flexible.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.580]   Spanish, Swahili.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   You see?
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.500]   Javier Millay needs to understand this, so.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.460]   By the way, Javier understood me without any words.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.620]   The language of love, maybe.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.620]   Of respect.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.620]   Respect.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.620]   I respect him.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.020]   I had a very good conversation with him.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.220]   Really brilliant.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.500]   May I sometimes speak Russian and sometimes English?
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   Yes.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.740]   You can use any language you like, and I think that's a very good rule for this first meeting
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.140]   between us.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.260]   As you said, maybe we will meet in the future for the second time.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.540]   Second and third and fourth?
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.540]   This is good.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.300]   You can ask questions in the language you'd like, and I will answer in the language I
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   can.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.500]   Well, you said you wanted to meet by the sea at some point.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.540]   So for our next meeting, let's meet by the sea.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.540]   With pleasure.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.540]   Next time, it would be much better to meet by our Ukrainian Black or our Azov Sea.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.700]   You know, I've been to a lot of...
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.280]   I have traveled to many cities in Ukraine, but I have never been to Odessa.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.180]   And everyone tells me that, and I don't know why.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.800]   You have to.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.860]   Can you explain to me why everyone loves Odessa so much?
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.760]   What's there?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.100]   You know, what's in Odessa?
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.140]   That's how they say it.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   What's there?
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.140]   In Odessa, we've got it all.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   Okay.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   Odessa.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.020]   I love Odessa.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.580]   Because of its particular temperament.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.340]   People have their own accent, and it's so...
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.900]   There are many nationalities, you know.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.420]   There are a lot of stories.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.320]   Authentic Odessa cuisine.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.300]   By the way, you know, the cuisine is very different from others.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.260]   The dishes are not like any other dishes, and everything is very tasty.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.620]   Also, there are beautiful people.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:37.460]   And today, you know, you understand people very well, especially after the attacks on
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.900]   Odessa.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.340]   You understand what the people are like.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.140]   Just how Odessites are.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.840]   Very Ukrainian.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.820]   And that's very cool.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.900]   I love Odessa.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.020]   I go there several times a year.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.900]   I go there several times a year now, because, hmm, well, now because of strengthening of
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.140]   air defense systems, because of this grain corridor, et cetera.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.980]   I go there more often.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.680]   They have the sun there.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.020]   They have the sea.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.740]   It's Ukraine, and it's very cool there.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.260]   Well, when you come and visit me in Texas as a guest for the third time...
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.260]   With pleasure.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.540]   Let's do this.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:25.340]   How about you, my friend Joe Rogan, and I will go get some Texas barbecue together?
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.340]   Who will pay?
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.380]   That's a good question.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   Putin.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380]   Putin.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.380]   For everything.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.380]   He has to pay.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.380]   Well, yes, we'll invite him, too.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   Okay.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.380]   Without him.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   Okay, I get it.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.380]   Understood.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:47.980]   But if the Rome Statute will be accepted by your government before this moment...
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.260]   By the way, I don't know if you know this, but Joe has a great comedy club in Austin.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   Joe Rogan?
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.260]   Joe Rogan, yes.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.900]   And I think that as a person who respects comedy and stand-up comedy, it would be interesting
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.100]   for you to have a look at it.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100]   No, no.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   He is...
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.860]   I know him, and I saw a lot of different videos.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.460]   He's a very talented person.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.860]   So it would be a pleasure if you invite me, and I'm able to do it.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.420]   I am a little bit busy.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:22.880]   But if I'll be in the United States, I hope that I will have a conversation and a meeting
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.020]   with President Trump.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.740]   And of course, during my visit, if I'll have the time, it would be a pleasure if you'll
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.740]   invite me.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.740]   With pleasure.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.020]   You know what?
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.020]   I will pay.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.020]   Good.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.500]   You know, I had to think about it, but you are the president.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   Yes.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.500]   With you.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   With pleasure.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   When the war is over, please come.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   Thanks so much.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   And when you're less busy.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   Thanks so much.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.220]   If we can go back many years, World War II.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.580]   Tell me the story of your grandfather who fought in World War II.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:00.680]   My grandfather, he graduated from the military academy.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.060]   And from the very beginning of the war, he went to fight.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.200]   He was in the infantry.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.380]   And he fought through the entire war.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.820]   He had many wounds.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.800]   As they used to say back then, his chest is covered in medals.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   And it's true.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.140]   He had more than 30.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.540]   Yes, more than 30.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.000]   He was the kind of man.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.940]   He was such, he was such a serious man.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.740]   I loved him very much.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.540]   And we had a very close relationship.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.740]   He didn't like to tell details about the war.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.540]   He never, he never boasted.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:48.260]   Although I asked him, as a boy would, how many fascists did you kill?
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.820]   He never talked about it.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:25:00.360]   He believed that the war was a great, a great tragedy, a tragedy for everyone.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.980]   And Ukraine was occupied.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:10.760]   And it was a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for Europe, and a tragedy for the Jewish people.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.840]   His own brothers, his entire family were executed.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:25.780]   They were tortured by fascists who had occupied Ukraine and their village.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.680]   His father was the head of the village.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.960]   And he was killed.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.320]   They were shot.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.400]   It was a mass, a mass grave, right?
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.480]   Yes, it was a communal burial.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   Some of them were killed outright and others were, they were buried alive.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.600]   His four brothers, they all went to war.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.900]   As soon as the war began, they were all there.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:01.800]   He was the only one who had a military education and they all died in the war.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.020]   He was the only one who came back.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.300]   He had nobody.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:15.360]   He came back and he found, found my grandmother, his future wife.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.400]   And she was, she managed, what was it called then?
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400]   I don't know.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.560]   They don't have them anymore.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:29.840]   It was a childcare facility, an orphanage, so to speak, a place where orphans lived.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.120]   Children who, who don't have parents, children of war.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.840]   And she managed this childcare facility with difficult children, as they used to call them.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.480]   Difficult children who went through the war, who saw their parents killed.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:55.860]   And this is how they met because these difficult children, they, well, sometimes behave differently.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.400]   They could steal something, do something bad.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   There were many, many children in the orphanage.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.200]   Yes.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.280]   That's how she met my grandfather.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.720]   And I loved him very much.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:21.680]   And I think that my grandfather, frankly, would never have believed that this war is
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.800]   possible.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.720]   He would never have believed it because he worked in the police after the war.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.380]   He was a colonel.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:35.640]   He worked in criminal investigation all his life.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:44.960]   So he fought with bandits all his life after the Second World War.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.840]   But also, I believe he fought for justice all his life.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.580]   And we all lived in one apartment.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:28:01.020]   And even after his death, I lived with both of my grandmothers and my parents, two grandmothers
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.760]   who both lost their husbands.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.320]   Both of them died.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:11.640]   Well, it was an ordinary family, an ordinary family that lived like everyone lived back
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.120]   then in the Soviet Union.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:21.520]   And even after the Soviets in the 90s, we lived in one apartment all together.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.780]   What else is there to say?
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:30.000]   But I think the most important thing was values, respect.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.120]   They gave me an education.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.200]   My parents gave me an education.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.080]   No one left me money or apartments, so I didn't inherit anything material.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.480]   But I believe that our real inheritance is here in our minds and in our hearts.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   I believe that.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:57.200]   There's a one-second delay.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.680]   So if, I'm sorry, if you tell a joke, I will laugh about one, two, or three seconds later.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.400]   There's a delay.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.640]   So ordinary family, but not an ordinary time, World War II.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   World War II, speaking of mass graves, I was at Bobin Yar yesterday.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.120]   A large part of my family died there.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.660]   In moments like this, such a place serves as a stark reminder of the profound historical
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.380]   gravity of the Second World War.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.040]   I remember, I remember this song from my youth.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:39.120]   On June 22nd at four o'clock, Kiev was bombed and the war began.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.480]   I always wondered how it would feel to live in a moment when, when everything changed.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.320]   The path of humanity completely shifts in a single moment, just like that.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.120]   What do you think, what do you think about that moment in 1941?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.960]   Now after the 2022 invasion, how do you perceive the Second World War after you have witnessed
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.760]   all of it?
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:11.040]   Well, um, well firstly, the war actually started earlier.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.560]   It started here in Ukraine, Kiev was bombed, as you quoted.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.000]   But the war had already begun before that.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.760]   And I think, I perceived it, um, as a start of the full-scale invasion.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   Well, I think it's hard, it's hard to understand why nobody wants to listen, look at, and analyze
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.360]   history.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:55.680]   War, the rise of fascism and Nazism, the emergence of Hitler, Goebbels, and their entire team.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:04.400]   At the time, this wasn't just about one party or even one country, it was, um, essentially
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:17.440]   a wave, a wave of hatred, a wave of one race, um, one race above the rest.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.720]   They were, in fact, constructing and ultimately implemented a theory around this idea, later
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.280]   seizing Europe.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:33.680]   Um, they created a theory of one nation, one race, one world, their world.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:40.320]   Of course, this idea is absolutely senseless, but it has become radicalized over the years
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   and even gained support.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:49.600]   A vision of one world, and in principle, the so-called Russian world, the ideology Putin
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.440]   promotes and imposes, it wasn't originally like that.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.240]   He was a different person back then, or maybe he was always like this, but his rhetoric
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.320]   was different.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.540]   At the beginning, remember, he talked about the EU, and even about Russia's future being
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.600]   tied to NATO.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.060]   There were even talks of joining the European Union, NATO.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.920]   He spoke about shared values with the West.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.080]   That's how it all sounded back then.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:23.560]   And we must also look at Hitler, who was seriously, um, before the radical idea of taking over
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:31.240]   the whole world, he actually made certain steps, and everyone believed he was helping
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:37.220]   the economy, and to be fair, he did take some steps in that direction.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.040]   But he was a terrifying person.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:47.200]   None of those actions justify him, nor do they excuse his actions.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.280]   And that's why we cannot look at the Second World War as if it started in 1939.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.080]   It didn't begin in 1941, either.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.840]   We need to draw conclusions.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.040]   When did it start?
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.080]   With the weaknesses of the world.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:08.440]   The division of European states, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, all of this happened before 1941.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:15.120]   People who were more informed, those who dug deeper, whether they were politicians or not,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:22.920]   whether they were from different walks of life, including business, which was different
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.200]   back then, were speaking about all of this.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   Hitler won't stop.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   There'll be a world war.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.040]   Hitler will destroy nations.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.580]   Nations.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.880]   And that's what happened.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.560]   Someone looked the other way.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.920]   What I told you about.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   Europe was sinking then.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.620]   I gave you an example of it.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.640]   But the whole world looked the other way and didn't pay attention and said, no, we can
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   negotiate with him.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.000]   I'm telling you he is okay.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.240]   We can negotiate with him.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.720]   He's just more right-leaning.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.800]   Or it does not matter what they said.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:05.320]   He's just, he's just pro, very pro-nationalist.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.460]   This is all nonsense.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.040]   And this is not the first time.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.400]   And Hitler isn't the first such case in history.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:27.560]   We're dealing with a person who is allowed to stick to this desire to destroy.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.580]   He was consumed by it and enjoying it.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.060]   And what happened to Hitler?
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.240]   Now what about Putin?
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.320]   This invasion was also at four in the morning, around four in the morning.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.960]   There were missile strikes on Ukraine.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   This is the same.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.080]   I believe that intentions are also the same, but more on that later.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.280]   By the way, you tell me if this is too long, you can stop me.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   Never long enough.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   Okay.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:02.520]   So it happened here around four in the morning.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.400]   Before this, I must honestly say.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.080]   Someone said something, predicted something, et cetera.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   But I asked only for one thing, primarily from the United States.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.580]   If you are sure, if you have the evidence, if you talk to him and he tells you that there'll
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:25.360]   be an invasion, if all this scares you, I only asked for two things.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:33.740]   Send us weapons or better yet, strengthen us with preventive measures so there would
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.700]   be no war.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.760]   It wasn't the weapons that I was asking for.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.300]   I asked for sanctions.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   Intimidate him.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   Please don't say that.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.600]   If he comes, if he crosses borders, if he kills, we're imposing sanctions.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.640]   Well, this is complete bullshit.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.920]   Sorry, but really- Oh, I understand this.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   Oh, wonderful.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   Yes.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   I understood one word.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.960]   So they did not help.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.280]   I believe that, no, and this is a fact.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.780]   We didn't receive help.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:15.600]   If we assume that words are help, well, then yes, we received a lot of it because there
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.540]   were plenty of words.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.960]   Even more than plenty, yes?
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.760]   At four in the morning, there were strikes.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.200]   Morally, is it possible to prepare for war?
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   No.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.400]   It doesn't happen like you read in books, see in movies, and so on.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.720]   What happens to you?
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.160]   I was just looking at my wife and children.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.560]   My children were asleep, but my wife was awake.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.140]   There were strikes, missile strikes.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.360]   We heard them.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.120]   To you as a living person, how can this be?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.920]   You just can't fully believe this.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.040]   You just don't understand.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   Why now?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:15.720]   Given everything that happened in World War II, when millions of people died, none of
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   it mattered.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.240]   Still, at four, at four in the morning, around 4, 3.40, 3.45, remember?
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.600]   Around this time, yes, there were missile strikes.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:36.400]   Even later, by the way, a few days after, after the first days of the war, I spoke with
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:47.080]   Lukashenko on the phone, and he apologized, and he said that it was not me.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.640]   Missiles were launched from my territory, and Putin was the one launching them.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.240]   These are his words.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:01.320]   I have witnesses, and I apologize, he said, but believe me, that's what he told me.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.280]   "Vladia, this is not me.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.840]   I'm not in charge," he told me.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.040]   "I'm not in charge.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   These are just missiles.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   This is Putin."
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.920]   I told him, "Don't do that.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.320]   This was done without me."
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.320]   That's it.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.800]   He just, on the phone, I remember this conversation.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.280]   I told him that I believed.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:30.080]   I told him, "You are a murderer too, I'm just saying," and he told me, "You must understand,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.480]   you can't fight the Russians."
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.240]   I told him that we never fought them.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.400]   I said, "It's war.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.680]   The missiles came from your land, from Belarus.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.560]   How did you allow this?"
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.500]   Then he replied, "All right, retaliate then."
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.520]   I still remember him telling me, "Hit the refinery.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.080]   You know how much I care about it.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.040]   Moser Oil Refinery, is that it?
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040]   Can't recall.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.080]   Moser Oil Refinery."
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.040]   I told him, "What are you on about?
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   What retaliation?"
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   "Forgive me, Vladia."
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.040]   "Yes."
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   "Yes."
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.040]   "Yes."
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   "This, this was at five in the morning?"
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.000]   "No, no, no, this was during the first or maybe the second day, second or third day
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   of the war."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   "Ah, I see."
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.940]   "After that, I went back home.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   I was home with my children, with my wife.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.380]   I just went to my wife very quickly that night, at four o'clock.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.900]   Yes, and just told her, 'Get the children, get ready, you'll probably need to go to my
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.180]   office very soon.'
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.180]   And I left.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.820]   That's it.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:39.620]   At this moment, you're, you're no longer a father.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:46.640]   That happened to me, unfortunately, because I believe that this is, and not only do I
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.760]   believe, I understand, especially now that all of this is the most important thing, because
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.120]   your country is your family.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.960]   The strength is in your family, and this is the most important thing.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.760]   And I'm the president, and therefore, I had to stop being a father in my own family.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.240]   And my wife had to do everything.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:15.920]   She had to do everything regarding children, regarding safety, and, and I had to deal with
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.640]   the state, because I'm the president, and this is my duty.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:26.840]   And I, by the way, am, I'm taking this very seriously.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.440]   I went to the office, and here we are now.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.440]   You're very welcome."
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:37.480]   Well, at that moment, on February 24th, 2022, everything changed again.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.760]   Just like in June 1941, everything changed.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.240]   And history took a turn.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.000]   The history of humanity took a turn.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.880]   And for you, too.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.600]   You were the president.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.960]   You were, you were talking about fighting corruption, about the country's freedom, about
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.480]   interesting and innovative reforms.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.280]   But that morning of February 22nd, everything changed.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:12.440]   Did you tell me about that morning, the details of your actions, when you had to quickly make
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.840]   difficult decisions?
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.400]   What was the process for you?
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.320]   How did you make these decisions?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:26.000]   Did you discuss them with people you trust to understand how to respond to this invasion
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.400]   in every technical, political, and military aspect?
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.680]   What was the process for you?
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.280]   How did you make the decision?
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:41.840]   According to our legislation, in principle, I'm the supreme commander of the armed forces
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   of Ukraine.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.880]   So I had to give corresponding orders.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.040]   Yes, I have a military office.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.080]   And then later there was a military headquarters where all key people gathered.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.180]   This is not only about the military, it's about energy, et cetera, all key things.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:04.120]   But at that moment, I made the decisions quickly and without a doubt.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.760]   And I cannot say that I am just that kind of person.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:15.080]   I'm just a living person who believed that if help is needed right now to help, to help
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.560]   evacuate people, help with children, several cities were blocked.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:27.200]   I was only thinking about how to deliver food there within a day.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:40.080]   We did a lot of things, although we understood that they, in fact, occupied part of our state.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:47.040]   And we distributed weapons to people.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.120]   That's how it was.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Militants came and simply distributed weapons to people so that they could defend the capital
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:03.640]   to ordinary people just on the street, to ordinary people who understood that if the
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:09.520]   Russians entered the city, then we would have the same thing that's happening in other cities
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.600]   per the information we received.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:19.560]   Thanks to digitalization, by the way, we had very good digitalization before this.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.200]   And we preserved a lot.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:28.480]   And even when they were surrounding certain cities, a lot of things still worked.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.520]   The banking system, the Internet, we had television.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:39.240]   And thanks to this, I made several decisions to ensure that people are united and have
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.120]   all the information.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:47.040]   Russia is very good at spreading large scale disinformation.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:56.880]   Fortunately, I have two decades of experience, two decades of experience managing a production
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   studio, TV channels, and large media resources.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:08.520]   I understood that we needed to build an information network very quickly.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.800]   Thanks to this, I began to address the people constantly.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.640]   This happened several times, three to five times a day.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:25.080]   In fact, I became that an information source for people who were in cities that were cut
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.200]   off from other information.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.840]   And it was very important for me to keep all things digital, to keep the Internet, to stay
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.880]   in touch with everyone, with all the people.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:46.520]   Initially, that's the contact we had, and then we also built a media platform where
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.640]   we had all the news agencies, agencies of Ukraine.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.440]   And this network was called Marathon.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.680]   And it was also very important for the people to trust us.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.920]   And people had to receive information.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.920]   Why?
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.760]   There were waves.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.360]   There were waves of Russian on the first day who said he ran away.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.840]   I had to go out into the street.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.120]   I left the office and went outside.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.900]   I had to do this because I was showing that this was no green screen, you know, to show
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:25.880]   that it was the street, not some digital, some digital manipulation.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.600]   I mean, I did these things.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.320]   Then I touched various objects.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:36.000]   Now, people might think that these are small things, but I was actually showing that I
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.760]   was in a real place.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.160]   All of this had an impact.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.760]   I was absolutely sure of my actions.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.320]   And these contacts, several contacts.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.720]   And then I spoke to the Russians.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   I addressed Russians.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.120]   I really did.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.360]   And then only after that, I gathered.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.680]   It was the first day when I invited all of the journalists here, wasn't it?
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:05.280]   It was on the first day, I think, well, not here, here, to the press center in this building.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.000]   I talked to journalists.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.240]   I asked them not to leave because we needed weapons.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.880]   At that moment, they were handing out rifles to people.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.080]   And for me, journalists and media platforms were essential voices.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:28.040]   There were various journalists from different countries here, and they were essentially
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.400]   stuck.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:37.600]   And I asked them for contacts, those who had access to Russians, Belarusians, Kazakhs who
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.680]   understood everything, the same information.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.840]   And I spoke to them.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.040]   And I spoke to them and spoke in Russian.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.400]   I told them, "You must stop Putin.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   This is terrible.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   This is horror.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.880]   You must stop him.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.360]   And if you stand up now, if you speak out, and if you go out into the streets."
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.440]   This was very important.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.480]   I spoke to them in Russian to show them that there was no problem and that all of these
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.360]   pretexts were made up.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:13.360]   This is why it's so painful to talk about the Russian language too, because, look, if
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.080]   a person does not want to listen, they will not listen no matter what language we speak.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.360]   I disagree with you here.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:27.440]   I think and hope that many people in Russia will hear us today.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.280]   They blocked YouTube recently.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.800]   Are you aware of this?
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.880]   In their country?
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.360]   I know.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.880]   And I simply guarantee that this conversation will travel fast on the internet.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   Everyone will hear you.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.640]   They will hear you.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.760]   Including the president of Russia will hear you.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.800]   This is why I have hope.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.360]   He is actually deaf, even if he speaks to you.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.600]   He is deaf by his very nature.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.720]   Do you understand the difference?
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:08.120]   You know, for instance, when you talk to Musk, you're talking to an innovator, a scientist
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.560]   about rockets.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.400]   You talk about how to save on costs and how they land.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.560]   And on the other hand, Putin doesn't launch rockets to save money, but to kill people.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:25.120]   Do you think you can talk to Putin about technology?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:32.200]   Your guys were interviewing him and he told them about tribal history.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.120]   Do you understand?
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.640]   Imagine a Russian man in his country listening to him.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.600]   You know what Musk is about?
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.400]   Technology, Mars, artificial intelligence.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.880]   And this guy Putin is standing there, bare assed, pontificating about tribes.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.240]   You've got to understand.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.360]   You think that when you do interviews, like Mr. Tucker, who did an interview there, that
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.800]   you're about to make them friends.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.320]   How could you?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.840]   What does this have to do with friends?
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.760]   He's different.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.600]   He is, he is simply different.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   But it's still necessary.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.840]   A mammoth stands before you.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.200]   By the way, I must say that when you said bare assed, it was not translated.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.080]   Could the interpreter please translate?
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.600]   This is so that you can understand.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.760]   Now he explained everything to me.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   I understand.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Yeah?
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   That's great.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   Now I fully understand.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   That's great.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   But we still need to talk.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.440]   One should always speak with someone who listens.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:38.200]   And you must speak when you know that this will benefit you, bring peace and calm to
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.160]   the world, not the other way around.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.880]   I love President Trump's message when he speaks.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.660]   I think that we share a position on peace through strength.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.080]   That is very important.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.520]   It means that if you are strong, you can speak.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.600]   And we need to be strong.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.280]   And Ukraine has to be strong.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.840]   Strong enough.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.960]   Otherwise what for?
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:19.040]   So he, you, you know who, like, like Voldemort, who must, who must not be named.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.240]   Yes, he's, he's like Voldemort.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:30.440]   He thrives, subsists and lives on being subjectivized instead of isolation.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.080]   He is offered to step out into the light.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.560]   He's darkness personified.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.400]   And you offer him, as it were, to be subjectivized.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   Why?
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:47.160]   There's only one reason, fear.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.120]   And you say, we need to talk, listen.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:55.800]   We need to be in a strong position and not talk, but end the war.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Yes.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.000]   Yes, it is possible through dialogue.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.440]   You're not opposed to it.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:07.400]   You just need to be in a strong position to make the other person want it.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.800]   Do you think he wants to end the war?
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.120]   That's what you suggested.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.360]   I think this is naive.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:19.600]   With all due respect, it's naive to think he wants to finish the war.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.720]   It's tell you what the circumstances, sorry for interrupting.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.840]   There's something we need.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.320]   I think that President Trump not only has will.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.720]   He has all these possibilities.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.080]   And it's not just talk.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.100]   I really count on him.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.960]   And I think that our people really count on him.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   So he has enough power to pressure him, to pressure Putin not into wanting to stop it.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.880]   No, he will not want to, to pressure him to actually stop it.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   That is the difference.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.620]   Don't rely on his will, Putin's will to stop.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.680]   You won't see it.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   That's what I think.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   Sorry.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   No, sorry.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.220]   I interrupted you first.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:15.480]   But what I would want, I do have what some might call a naive dream of you sitting down
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:23.080]   with Putin and Trump and negotiating a deal about a ceasefire and together finding a path
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.120]   to long-term peace.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:32.160]   And I think this requires strength, requires negotiations.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.680]   There are a lot of carrots and sticks here that can be used to make a real deal.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.200]   And Trump is very keen on making a deal and ready to negotiate.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.600]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:51.520]   I just really want you and I to be on the same page.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:59.480]   It's very important to be in the same information space, extremely important.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.400]   Let's talk a bit about the ceasefire.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.080]   Let me describe the situation to you.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:14.160]   In December 2019, in Normandy, in Paris, at the Elysee Palace, Macron, Merkel, Putin and
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:22.840]   I agreed on the ceasefire, the U.S. wasn't there, and this, by the way, was a weak point
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   of the meeting.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.520]   If you'd like, we can later discuss why they weren't there.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.200]   It's a security guarantee thing in general.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.460]   It's Germany's position, etc.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.760]   We agreed on an exchange of hostages and all for all exchange.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.800]   We made a deal to exchange everyone for everyone.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.120]   I think you know that.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:49.400]   And there was also a meeting that lasted many hours, a meeting where we made, we made a
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.340]   deal with him.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.340]   Everyone was tired.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.880]   It was just the two of us in the end.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.360]   And I proposed a ceasefire.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:03.760]   By the way, no one in Ukraine believed, few believed in the ceasefire.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.120]   And he wanted troop withdrawal.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:10.240]   I calculated that if there were a withdrawal of troops from the line of contact the way
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.900]   Russians proposed, it would take 20 years.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:20.020]   I proved it to him just in terms of time, square kilometers, namely the length of the
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.320]   line of contact or delimitation line.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:29.280]   And we agreed on what I told him that it will not work out.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.560]   But I had many points because I was deeply involved in the issue.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.520]   I was involved very deeply.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:42.080]   It's my thing in general, if I start doing something, I can't stand there like that guy
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:51.200]   I spoke about with my ass out, you know, I must be dressed, I must be prepared.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:58.180]   I must be prepared better, better than anyone in front of me.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.120]   You do sports, right?
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:06.360]   I practiced for many years and we know what fights are like, what boxing is, what Thai
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.600]   boxing is.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.660]   This is what I did and I loved it very much.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:16.600]   When you step into the ring, you understand everything pretty much.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:23.520]   And so I stepped into it and I was definitely well prepared.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.440]   But he wasn't, no.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.160]   He was not deeply involved in the process.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.480]   Short border, where is it?
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.880]   How long will it take to disengage troops?
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.400]   And why wasn't he involved?
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.960]   You want to know?
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.620]   Because he wasn't going to do any of this.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.100]   This is what confused me.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:49.360]   If you are not deeply involved in the issue, well, then you, it's, it's as if you don't
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.240]   really need the result.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.440]   That's what I think.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.440]   So what happened?
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:56:04.960]   We agreed that there will be gas continuation, gas transit in 2019.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.920]   We agreed with him, this was a security for Europe.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.520]   Merkel asked me for it.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.560]   And this was extremely important for Germany.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.200]   We agreed with him.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.000]   Secondly, we agreed that for him, it was just money.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.760]   So secondly, we agreed on an exchange.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.960]   For me, this was the most important thing.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.280]   For them, gas was, for me, was the people.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:37.440]   And this is a fact, because I wanted to have a humanitarian advantage, so that there would
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.320]   be further meetings that would lead to sustained peace.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   And third, ceasefire, ceasefire you spoke about.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   What happened?
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.940]   The gas contract was signed because he needed it.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.960]   And by the way, he knew everything about it.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:08.440]   As for exchange, we took the first step and exchanged the people.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   Regarding the ceasefire, well, they started killing us in about a month.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:25.840]   So I called him and I told him, we agreed on a ceasefire, didn't we?
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.360]   Well, it wasn't a piece of toilet paper, was it?
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.480]   This is serious business.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.600]   Or so it seemed.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.400]   It really was serious.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   Merkel, Macron, you and I, we all agreed on this together.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.440]   A ceasefire is important, isn't it?
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.880]   Not for New Year's, because everyone was celebrating New Year's.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.280]   And now they're offering us a Christmas ceasefire.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   It's all the same.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.860]   A ceasefire for two, three days, just to get some praise.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.520]   But this isn't a performance.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.200]   This isn't some kind of theater.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.720]   No, this is about people's lives.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   And that's what happened.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.200]   After that, I called him a few more times.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.760]   I think I only had two, three calls with him in total.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.160]   I asked him for a ceasefire.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.960]   He told me it couldn't be.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.220]   We will figure it out now.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:22.400]   People from the occupied territory, Russians and separatists, they were all there together.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.960]   They continued to shoot and kill our people.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:33.280]   Yes, the front lines were quiet, but they killed people.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.640]   They were killing people.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.920]   And I kept calling him.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.200]   I called again and again, but there was nothing.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.280]   Until after a few months, the Russians stopped answering the phone.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.840]   We did not have any contact since.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.560]   I wanted another meeting, like we had in Normandy.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.160]   I wanted the next meeting.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.480]   I wanted to find a solution, but the Russians refused.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:01.120]   We tried to make it happen through various European countries.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:04.080]   And not only European, but the Russians refused.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.240]   They passed along some kind of bullshit, made excuses, they didn't want it.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.120]   Meanwhile, they were sending their snipers.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:18.080]   We had evidence, living proof, even video evidence, because some of them were captured
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.160]   back then.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.900]   Those were the snipers in training.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.200]   They were training them.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.580]   They were training them.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:28.480]   And later, those snipers operated in Syria and Africa.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.080]   These snipers were training in our country, in the east.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.320]   Russians were living targets.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.680]   They were shooting from the other side, killing people, women, people, children.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.960]   They were shooting.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.400]   It was a hunt.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.800]   By the way, it was in the Russian-speaking region in the east, where, according to him,
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.360]   everyone is speaking Russian.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:56.080]   That's where they were shooting, where the situation currently is the most tense.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.400]   They killed people.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.120]   We sent this information, sent pictures.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.320]   We sent them to the UN, sent them everywhere.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.680]   We worked very hard, very persistently.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.300]   I met with everyone.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.260]   But who thought of Ukraine back then?
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.940]   They didn't notice it much.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:18.400]   They didn't pay much attention to Crimea being illegally occupied either.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.280]   And to be honest, the United States of America, too.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.520]   Everyone was somewhat silent about this issue.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.760]   That's how it was.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.600]   It was like that before a full-scale war.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.480]   I want to ask you a question about the ceasefire.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:48.520]   For example, in Mariupol today, there are American and Ukrainian journalists, and everyone
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:57.040]   will tell you who has contact now with Mariupol, who fled from there in the last minutes just
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.720]   before the occupation, or who was able to leave to escape after the occupation.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.920]   Chernoff, who won an Oscar, was among them.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.760]   And the journalists that left Mariupol, they are here.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.880]   By the way, we had a conversation.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:22.320]   They will tell you that 20,000, 30,000 civilians were tortured and buried there.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.520]   We do not know the number of victims.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.140]   People who didn't want to work with them, who refused to cooperate with them.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.320]   People who went on strikes to protest.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.640]   People who did not want to work with the Russians who occupied Mariupol.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.860]   And this is one example, just with this city.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.760]   And I have a question for you.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.800]   What about the millions of children?
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.640]   And I will ask you in Russian so that you hear this without delay.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.720]   What about the millions of children over there?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.400]   What if we just arranged a ceasefire without understanding what would happen next?
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.800]   Without understanding what will happen to Ukraine's security guarantees?
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.200]   What about the millions of children in the occupied territories?
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.440]   What should I tell them?
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.660]   What am I to tell them?
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.920]   What is it I should tell them?
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.240]   What?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240]   Whatever?
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.280]   Hey, all of you over there, see ya.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.820]   And those tens of thousands of people buried there, they were, is that what we want?
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.180]   Are we ready to forgive them for this?
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.620]   We must at least take the first step.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.300]   If this is a ceasefire, we must know that there is a security guarantee for the part
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.660]   of Ukraine under our control.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.060]   We need it so that he will not come back.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.440]   This is very important.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.820]   And what do we say to the people who live in those territories?
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.220]   These are millions of people.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:50.860]   Did you know that since 2014 in Donetsk, in the Crimea, this is happening in Melitopol
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.500]   as well, as in Berdyansk now.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:03:03.720]   They are making all these kids of drafting age go and fight.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.980]   And if they don't go, they will be killed.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.360]   This is, do you understand what's happening?
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:18.340]   That is why a ceasefire, everything I said, what I wish for, and I believe in President
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:28.380]   Trump's power to use all of this information to come up with a way to make Ukraine strong
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.100]   and be strong.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.780]   Why am I saying that?
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:38.260]   I will give you an example.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:47.000]   President Trump will be in the same situation as I was in 2019, precisely the same situation.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.020]   I want to end the war.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.400]   We want a lasting peace for Ukraine.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:58.340]   We must do this, the ceasefire, exchange people, and then diplomatically return all territories.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.100]   And we will do this through diplomacy.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.400]   What will happen next with President Trump?
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.580]   If the ceasefire happens without security guarantees, at least for the territory we
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:18.080]   control, what does he get if he manages to make a ceasefire deal?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.360]   And three months later, Putin launches a new wave of attacks.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.920]   What will Trump look like?
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.060]   What will Ukraine look like?
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.540]   What will everyone look like?
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.540]   Putin will just do it.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.820]   And why would Putin do it?
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.680]   Because today he's afraid of Trump.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:47.440]   But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious security
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.480]   guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   Not that he wants to.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.020]   No, he does not want that.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.260]   I believe in what he says.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.860]   That he will give Putin an opportunity.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.740]   Because in Putin's head, he wants me to fight with Trump.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:08.620]   Putin's plan is to end the occupation of our territory.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.420]   This is in his sick head.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.700]   And I'm absolutely sure of this.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:22.380]   That is why I told you, don't wait for Putin to want to stop the war.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:28.780]   Pressure him so that he is forced to stop the war.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.700]   That's important.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.180]   It's important to say that what you said about the children is a tragedy.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.740]   War is hell.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:38.900]   But let me say again, we must find a path to peace.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.340]   There is one.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.340]   What is it?
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.500]   There is one.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.860]   Before ceasefire, strong Ukraine.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.020]   Strong Ukraine's position?
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.380]   Yes, we can speak about it with Trump.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:53.860]   For me, we can speak about security guarantees.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:58.500]   But a quick step, a quick step is NATO.
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.900]   A partial membership NATO.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.340]   Yes, I understand.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   I understand.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.920]   I understand Trump's feelings about NATO.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.620]   I heard him.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.300]   He's thinking through all of it, of course.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:16.940]   But anyway, yes, NATO is a strong security guarantee for all the people, for us.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.700]   Part of security guarantees.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.300]   The second part is the arms aid package, which we will not use.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:28.020]   If a ceasefire works, nobody will use the weapons.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.020]   For what?
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.380]   But it has to stay.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:35.860]   But with all due respect to the United States and to the administration, not like before,
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.700]   I don't want the same situation like we had with Biden.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.540]   I ask for sanctions now, please.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.420]   And weapons now.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.220]   And then we will see if they start it again.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.480]   Of course, we'll be happy if you'll give us more and you will stand with us shoulder
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480]   to shoulder.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.860]   Of course, that is right.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:59.700]   But but it's different when you have weapons.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.320]   Putin wouldn't have been able to occupy so much territory.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.380]   It was very difficult for us to push him out.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.200]   But we didn't have weapons before.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.780]   And that is the same situation.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.700]   It can be the same situation.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.860]   I'm just sharing this with you.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.540]   Like I said at the very beginning, I want to be very honest with you and with your audience.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.580]   Yes, it's true.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:24.760]   If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.700]   To make it clear, let's describe.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.260]   The idea that you are speaking about.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.620]   I would like to offer you other ideas, too.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:39.460]   But right now, your idea is that NATO accepts Ukraine minus the five regions of Luhansk,
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.700]   Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kursan and Crimea.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.460]   So you understand the situation.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.220]   The invitation to NATO is legislatively issued to Ukraine.
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.980]   So to us, all those territories are still Ukraine.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:03.260]   But NATO so far can only act in the part that is under Ukrainian control.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.380]   This can be negotiated.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.700]   I am sure about that.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   Yes, this would not be a great success for us.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:16.260]   But if we see a diplomatic way to end the war, this is one of the ways.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.260]   So it is.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.260]   Sorry.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.260]   That is a start.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.380]   Secondly, weapons, arms aid package.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.620]   I'm not ready to discuss this publicly right now.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.100]   It's all written down.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.620]   And President Trump might have seen it or not.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.340]   But we've got no secrets from him.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340]   Yes.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.260]   But mostly it depends on the willingness of the United States.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:43.940]   Because some of it will come from the EU, some from the United States, of course, together.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.460]   So not just from the United States.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.460]   No, no, no.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.300]   We need unity with this package.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:53.460]   So the package and sanctions, yes, sanctions.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:59.260]   But I think it's in the interest of all the smart people to not have Russian energy on
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.820]   the market in general.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:03.180]   So he he has to stop it.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.540]   That's all.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.540]   It's fine.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.580]   American oil, American gas is OK.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.580]   Why not?
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:09.820]   And it's cheaper.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.020]   So it will be cheaper for the whole world.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.080]   The money will go to the United States.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.580]   And I think he will be happy and the president and your people will be happy.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.580]   But it's your decision.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.580]   I'm just sharing.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.580]   Yes.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   And cheap oil.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.420]   So Putin won't have so much money for for the war.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.740]   And that that's it.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.140]   But this is difficult because it's a lot.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.260]   You're saying to continue the sanctions on Russia to accept Ukraine into NATO.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.300]   I need to ask you some difficult questions about this.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.540]   Yes, go on.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.980]   I trust and respect your words today.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.580]   Many people respect and love you in America.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.420]   Trump respects you.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   Loves me.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.620]   Oh, come on now.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.740]   Remember last time you corrected me when I said that you love Javier Millet?
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.740]   You said no, no, no.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740]   I respect him.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.740]   So let's not talk about love today.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:03.460]   But could we talk seriously about about guaranteeing Russia's security?
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.420]   OK, can I interview you a little?
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.940]   Question is, what land is the war happening on?
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:11.540]   And where did it start?
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.740]   On our soil, on our territory.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.520]   International law was violated.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.380]   The sovereignty of our country was violated.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.380]   Civilians were killed.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.080]   Tens of thousands of our people were taken hostage.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.020]   And everyone will tell you this happened.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.700]   This is what happened.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.220]   When I speak with the Global South, which is trying to balance the two sides because
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:41.060]   of the history, because of their roots and because of their shared economic interests
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.620]   with Russia in the past.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:49.940]   And now, of course, when you talk to them, they are speaking a little bit like you.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:55.380]   I mean, they're balancing a little bit, you know, yeah, a little bit in between.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.900]   But we will work on it.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.900]   It's it's our first meeting.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.220]   During the second one, you will be more on our side.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.860]   But it's just just just very convincing.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.860]   We will.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:05.860]   Very charismatic.
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.860]   Thank you.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.620]   But when I speak with them, when I speak, it's very important.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:17.900]   Even with their balancing our attitude towards the war.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.700]   They all recognize that this is a war.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   This is not just internal conflict.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:32.700]   This is a full scale war.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.420]   That began that Putin began.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:43.740]   And all of them, all of them, if you talk to them, they say, but then they all recognize
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:55.620]   that that it's his own big mistake, Putin's mistake and that he's not right.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.780]   That's why I said, no, no, he's not right.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.500]   And you have to begin from this.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:06.260]   If you begin at the middle between Ukraine and Russia, of course, we can speak like this.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.580]   You are in the middle and say, OK, what's going on?
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.740]   There is a fight.
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.940]   Where is the fight?
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:19.260]   It's not the fight like like in Europe when Napoleon is fighting against somebody in the
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.500]   middle of Europe.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:25.620]   No, this is not in the middle of somewhere of the planet, not the planet.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.620]   It's concretely on our land.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:35.700]   So one country with one army, one person came to another.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.940]   That's it.
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.180]   It's very clear.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.420]   Again, I would like us to find a path to peace.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.320]   So let us nevertheless try to start in the middle.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.340]   What other ideas do you think might you are a very intelligent person and your Russian
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.540]   isn't that good either.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.380]   And I told you, yes, that this is only our first meeting.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.460]   My English is not very good either.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.180]   Your English is very good.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.180]   Thank you.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.260]   To be honest, I'm terrible at speaking in every language.
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:07.460]   Well, there there are other ideas, for instance, sorry to say this.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.460]   It sounds crazy.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:12.900]   But what if both Ukraine and Russia are accepted into NATO?
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:18.020]   Putin himself spoke about Russia, maybe about NATO.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.480]   What you just said is very correct.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.420]   What are the guarantees for Russia?
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.580]   It's not like I'm even interested what happens to them.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:32.420]   To be honest, I don't care what will happen to them in the future after the war ends.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:38.960]   But these are our borders and we must understand what is going on there.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.380]   Well, the NATO guarantees for Ukraine.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:46.660]   Actually, this is also a security guarantee for the Russians.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.660]   Frankly, I talked about this many times before.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:56.860]   Sorry, I'm speaking figuratively, but as an example, if you were a father who lost
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.820]   his children.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:04.900]   A grown man, a grown man, a man, an adult.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.580]   And the war has ended.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:12.660]   And he never got never got justice for real.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.660]   For example, somebody decides to freeze support.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.940]   We won't give you anything.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]   You can't fight.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.300]   You can't continue.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.620]   So we stop when we stop without any guarantees, without any support, without financing, without
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.060]   OK.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:31.080]   And nobody is held accountable.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.940]   But the man lost his children.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.620]   He will not get anything.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.180]   None of the killers will be in prison.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:42.340]   All the sanctions will be removed.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.260]   And and he lost his children.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.020]   And we have thousands of such people.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.380]   Why do you think they will not go to Russia?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.460]   We'll find a way and we'll not kill the Russian soldiers there or somebody there.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.460]   Why wouldn't they?
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.740]   It's human nature.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.340]   It's not about us.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.860]   It's everyone read American writers.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.820]   Always after any war.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.900]   If there is no justice for people.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.460]   There must be punishment for the crime.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.980]   It is only justice.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.620]   How come my child was taken away?
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.300]   The war took him.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.420]   This is very scary.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:29.820]   And even whether it was my son who was fulfilling his constitutional duty or simply a missile
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.040]   that struck a civilian child.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.140]   And if there is no justice and the killers are not punished.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:42.260]   Why wouldn't these people come back with hate?
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.980]   They will definitely come back.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.500]   So when we talk about NATO.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.660]   NATO is not only stopping Russia.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:58.300]   Do not forget NATO is stopping us, too.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.580]   Because there will not be justice for everyone.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:07.380]   We know that NATO does not have the right to solve certain issues with war.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.420]   NATO is a security alliance.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.860]   It is protection, not brainwashing.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.980]   What Putin claims that this is offensive is not true.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:22.700]   NATO is a defensive alliance, a security alliance, and it is security for Russia.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:28.700]   But unfortunately, there are many options for peace that don't involve NATO inviting
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.180]   Ukraine as a member.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.420]   Can you imagine security guarantees without NATO membership?
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:42.140]   For example, if America simply leaves NATO, I believe there is a high likelihood that
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.020]   Donald Trump would do such a thing.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.720]   I think it's very bad for NATO.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.060]   That's the end.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.740]   That is.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.380]   That's the death of NATO.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.820]   It is a pity because I think that it's a very good alliance.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:02.020]   Maybe not everything is good there from the bureaucracy or money, etc., but totally countries
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:07.260]   who are in NATO, they they don't fight.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:12.620]   There is no war on the land of any of these NATO countries.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.100]   I think that is the answer.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.880]   It works or not.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.940]   It works politically or militarily.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.900]   I don't know, but it works.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:26.540]   So without Trump, without the United States of America, there will not be NATO.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.940]   That is the first.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.080]   So and you say, can we imagine that?
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   That what?
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.820]   That there could be security guarantee without.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.260]   No, we don't need guarantees without the United States.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.260]   That's it.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:45.300]   Because the United States is a very strong, powerful country.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.460]   The United States puts the point.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:52.980]   Of course, Putin said that it's just the Soviet Union, where, by the way, Ukraine was the
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.220]   second strong republic militarily.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.720]   Yes, by the way.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.540]   But he he, of course, always forgets about it.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:04.480]   But during the World War II.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.940]   Without help of the United States, support of your troops, support of your industry,
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:20.620]   industrially, militarily, without your money, without your people, Hitler could could win.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:28.300]   So the United States helped a lot, of course, Europe, USSR, and of course, everybody fought.
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.620]   Everybody did a lot.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:33.260]   But without the United States, it couldn't be such.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:40.900]   I don't use the word success, because I think that there is no war which ends successfully,
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:47.460]   because this is a war, seven figure losses, heavy losses in World War II, millions of
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.460]   people.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:53.340]   And that's why without the United States, security guarantees are not possible.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:59.860]   I mean, these security guarantees which can prevent Russian aggression.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:05.620]   Of course, we have security guarantees bilaterally with some countries financing support of our
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:12.060]   internal military and defending and humanitarian issues and demining, which is very important
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.580]   and helping our children in the school networks.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.460]   By the way, this is a very sensitive point.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.460]   How many?
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.300]   How many bomb shelters?
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.780]   How many bomb shelters we built with the partners for the children?
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.420]   And it's a pity that they are underground.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:32.300]   But can you imagine their eyes when they came after COVID?
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.340]   You understand what does it mean, COVID, but they had COVID and the war.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.820]   And together, they didn't see each other for so many years.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:47.340]   And when they saw each other, even underground, they were very happy and smiling.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.820]   So we have such security guarantees.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.060]   But it's not enough to prevent.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:00.980]   Yes, preventive measures also work to prevent the aggression of Putin to stop.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.900]   Your English is better than my Russian.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.820]   This is so this is wonderful.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:06.820]   I'm not sure.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.100]   I'm just giving you a compliment.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.100]   Thank you.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.100]   No, no.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.100]   Thank you.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.100]   Do that kind of thing to a president.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.100]   Thanks so much.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:20.580]   By the way, once again, without NATO guarantees, I have a dream that, let's say, on January
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:27.380]   25, or sometime at the end of January this year, you will sit down with Donald Trump,
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:34.300]   with Vladimir Putin, and together negotiate a ceasefire with strict security guarantees.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:39.100]   And an agreement will be signed.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.500]   What will this look like without NATO?
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.420]   I will make it clear.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:49.960]   And so first of all, I think, January 25, or some other day, well, you just call it
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.220]   January 25.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.580]   And I don't mind.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.060]   It's my birthday.
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:03.940]   And we sit down, first of all, with Trump.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:11.060]   We agree with him on how we can stop the war, stop Putin.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:15.740]   It is important for us to sit down with him.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:23.900]   Secondly, it is very important for us that Europe, which is very important for us because
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:30.860]   we are part of Europe, and not only geographically, geopolitically, but also in the European Union
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:31.900]   where we will be.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:37.620]   For us, it is very important that Europe also has a voice.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:43.260]   It's the second thing, it won't be long because Europe will be looking at us and will be looking
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.980]   at Trump.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:51.240]   And by the way, I now see that when I talk about something with Donald Trump, whether
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:57.020]   we meet in person or we just have a call, all the European leaders always ask, how was
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.020]   it?
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.500]   This shows the influence of Donald Trump.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.780]   And this has never happened before.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:11.420]   With an American president, I tell you from my experience, this also gives you confidence,
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.340]   you know, that he can stop this war.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:22.780]   That is why we and Trump come first and Europe will support Ukraine's position because they
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:28.660]   understand that Ukraine has every right to have its voice heard in this because we are
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.020]   at war.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:38.500]   Trump and I will come to an agreement and then if, and I am sure that he can offer strong
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:45.620]   security guarantees together with Europe, and then we can talk to the Russians.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.620]   That's right.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:52.100]   Not just three of us sitting down at once.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.620]   And you still talk to me like that.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:23:01.900]   Do you know how, as if Putin wants to sit down and talk, but Ukraine does not?
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:02.900]   This is not true.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.540]   I think that, yes, he is in fact ready to talk.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:07.700]   Did you talk to him?
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.240]   On the phone or what?
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.700]   How do you normally talk to him?
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:11.780]   I don't know.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780]   Normally by the sea.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.820]   The same as with you.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.900]   He invites you to the sea with me.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.900]   Just the three of us.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.900]   No, no.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.900]   One of us may drown.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.900]   Who?
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.900]   Are you good at swimming?
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:21.900]   Yes.
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.900]   I am a good swimmer.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.900]   You're a good swimmer.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.580]   I am a good swimmer.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:31.380]   And I would like to add that if you have any contact with him, I just want to hear what
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.820]   happens then.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:39.460]   I have never talked to Vladimir Putin, but I have a feeling that he is ready because
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.980]   Donald Trump is ready.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.860]   I hope you are ready.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.420]   And this is not just a feeling, but a dream.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:55.760]   I have a dream here that the three of you will get together in a room and make peace.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.280]   And I want to understand what it looks like, what security guarantees look like that would
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.500]   satisfy Ukraine, that would satisfy Russia.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.220]   Ukraine needs security guarantees first and foremost.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.600]   We are in danger.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.100]   That is why they are called so.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.580]   This is no joke to me.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.140]   Let's take a few steps back.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.380]   Interesting.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:29.420]   Why are security guarantees, a strong position of Ukraine, strong weapons, and so on so important?
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.620]   I will give you a little history lesson.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:38.820]   Although I think you have prepared yourself and know everything perfectly, well, you can
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.940]   correct me on that.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:47.620]   First, Ukraine had security guarantees, the Budapest Memorandum.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.140]   Nuclear weapons are the security guarantees that Ukraine had.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.260]   Ukraine had nuclear weapons.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:56.340]   I do not want to characterize it as good or bad.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.620]   Today, the fact that we do not have them is bad.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.620]   Why?
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.620]   Because this is war.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.340]   Today, we are at war.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:09.380]   Because you unleashed, because you have unleashed the hands of a nuclear power.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:15.700]   A nuclear power is fighting against us, against Ukraine, and doing what it wants.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:23.380]   By the way, even you are now talking about ceasefire, just a ceasefire.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:28.660]   Maybe give flowers to Putin, maybe to say, "Thank you so much for these years.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.780]   That was a great part of my life."
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.860]   No, we are not just ready for this.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.860]   Why?
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:39.360]   The Budapest Memorandum, nuclear weapons, this is what we had.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.140]   Ukraine used them for protection.
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:43.900]   This does not mean that someone attacked us.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.340]   That doesn't mean that we would have used it.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.300]   We had that opportunity.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.180]   These were our security guarantees.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.240]   Why am I talking about this in detail?
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.700]   Because if you take the Budapest Memorandum, by the way, I discussed this with President
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.700]   Trump.
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:01.340]   We have not finished this conversation yet.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.060]   We will continue it.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.860]   Regarding the Budapest Memorandum, the Budapest Memorandum included security guarantees for
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.860]   Ukraine.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   Three.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Three.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:18.740]   The most important security guarantors for Ukraine, three strategic friends and partners
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.940]   of Ukraine.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.260]   This was in agreement.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:28.780]   United States of America, Russia, Britain, France and China joined.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:34.900]   There were five states that, these are not even security guarantees.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:40.200]   We now understand that this is not a guarantee of security, because on the one hand, these
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.760]   are security guarantees.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.500]   But there was an English word, as far as I understand, assurance.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.380]   It is translated as assurance, assurance, right?
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:59.580]   And in Russian, it will be and what assurance?
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:08.140]   That is, give up nuclear weapons because you were under pressure of the U.S. and Russia
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.960]   for Ukraine to give them up.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.900]   These two powers were exerting pressure.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.620]   These two states negotiated to ensure that Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.620]   Ukraine agreed.
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.780]   These, these are the largest states.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:27.800]   This is the nuclear five that does not, not even provide security guarantees.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.660]   Now we just need to find these people and we just need to put in jail all of those who,
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:36.740]   frankly, invented all this.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:42.860]   So confidence, so confidence, assurance.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:51.700]   Assurance that Ukraine will be territorially integral with its sovereignty.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.140]   It was a piece of paper.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:28:01.040]   If you are curious, by the way, that after occupying part of our Donbass and Crimea,
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.100]   Ukraine sent diplomats three times.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.580]   I don't think I remember.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:11.700]   Three times within a few years, we sent letters to all security guarantors, to all members
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:14.100]   of the Budapest Memorandum.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.140]   What did they send?
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:21.280]   That what was written on the piece of paper, consultations.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.000]   Ukraine holds consultations if its territorial integrity is violated and everyone should
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.700]   be in consultation.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.820]   Everyone must come.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:35.220]   Everyone must meet urgently.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:42.460]   USA, Britain, Russia, France, China.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.780]   Did anyone come, you ask?
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.780]   No.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:49.900]   Did anyone reply to these letters, official letters?
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.880]   They are all recorded by diplomats.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.940]   Did anyone conduct consultations?
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.140]   No.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.140]   And why not?
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.220]   They didn't give a fuck.
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:01.400]   This is understandable in Russian, right?
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:07.500]   That as Russia didn't give a damn, neither did all the other security guarantors of the
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.900]   Budapest Memorandum.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:16.540]   None of them gave a damn about this country, these people, these security guarantees, etc.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:19.360]   We take a break.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.800]   This will be a Budapest Memorandum.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:29.740]   The last time with me, imagine how many years it was with me, in February 2022.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:32.660]   In February 2022, the war began.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.900]   A full-scale war.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.440]   Letters for consultations have been sent.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.540]   No one answers.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:46.180]   Next, we are taking a break from the Budapest Memorandum.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.040]   The question is simple about Budapest.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.380]   Can we trust this?
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.380]   No.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:58.300]   Whichever country out of these five sat at the negotiating table, just a piece of paper.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:02.220]   Believe me, we will save you.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.740]   No.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.100]   Another.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.860]   This is a train.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:15.020]   This is a train with waste paper, with security guarantees, which Ukraine has been writing
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.260]   for many years.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.060]   The second car on this train is the Minsk agreements.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:27.500]   The Normandy format and the Minsk agreements, where it was written, where the signatories
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.500]   were.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500]   The United States of America was no longer there.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.340]   I understand that Obama was here at the time.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:37.860]   And as far as I know, I think they were simply not interested in what happened to Ukraine
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.620]   and where it was in general, where it was located.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.620]   Well, somewhere there.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.620]   Part of something.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.900]   People, well, people, and let it be.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.460]   Let it be with these people.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:54.500]   The United States simply did not participate in the Minsk agreements.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.980]   There are no claims to the U.S. because they were not guarantors.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.880]   Where is the claim?
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:07.760]   A step back, 2008, Bucharest.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.180]   Everyone has already learned from the Budapest Memorandum.
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:16.420]   Bucharest, 2008, Bucharest.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:24.220]   Mr. Bush, President of the United States, Republican, says that Ukraine should be in
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:26.380]   NATO.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.160]   This is the voice of Republicans.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.900]   Check it out.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.980]   Ukraine should be in NATO.
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.300]   Everybody's looking at the U.S., always.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.300]   All in favor.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.300]   Who is against?
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:39.300]   Merkel.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:45.100]   She opposes and she forced everyone not to give Ukraine an invitation to join NATO because
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.660]   that would be a step.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.180]   Seriously, Republicans were in favor.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:56.400]   The U.S. was in favor because Republicans and Bush were not afraid of anyone.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.820]   They were not afraid of anyone and they knew that Ukraine rightly wanted to join NATO.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.980]   She chooses so.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.140]   And what is the question?
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.460]   Well, people made their choice.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.700]   Well, and the Russians will not look that way.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.220]   That was not the case then.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.220]   Why?
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.100]   Because the Russians were different.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:18.860]   Next, Minsk.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.180]   We didn't succeed.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:27.180]   After the Minsk agreements, as I told you, hundreds of meetings were held.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:33.700]   I have had hundreds of meetings since 2019.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.060]   We could not think about a ceasefire.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:39.100]   A ceasefire is our offer.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.820]   This is not somebody's suggestion.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:42.820]   This is mine.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.780]   I would like.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.540]   I wanted to in Ukraine.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.740]   Society was divided.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.020]   Not everyone wanted to.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.260]   Half did not want to.
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260]   Half were against.
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.500]   Half were in favor.
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.420]   Some of them shouted, "Do not believe it."
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.380]   Some of them shouted, "Believe it."
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:01.180]   I am the president of Ukraine.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:07.060]   I was given a mandate of trust by 70% of the population to take appropriate steps.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   And I made them.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.060]   This is not a joke.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.500]   We'll just sit the three of us.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.720]   I am simply telling you what is.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.980]   This is how can I tell you.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:25.820]   These meetings must be serious and prepared.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.340]   And prepared with those who want peace.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:29.340]   Ukraine wants peace.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.180]   U.S. wants peace.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.820]   We have to sit down with Trump, and that is 100%.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.020]   First and foremost, number one.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:42.740]   Moreover, he told me on the phone that he is waiting for us to meet, and there will
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.940]   be an official visit.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:48.460]   And my visit would be the first or one of the first to him.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.660]   And for him, this topic is very important.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.940]   I know that he has his own matters, American issues, I understand.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:34:01.660]   I heard his election program, but regarding international affairs, I think our issue is
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.780]   one of the most pressing issues for President Trump.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:09.160]   Therefore, I believe very much, I trust his words, and I hope we will meet again.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:12.000]   We need to prepare.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.220]   We have many plans to build on, and they exist, and they are supported by many countries.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.780]   But we need his vision.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:26.460]   He needs to look at all these details, but his vision, please.
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:31.380]   Because he can't stop Putin, because Putin is afraid of him.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.180]   That's a fact.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:39.980]   But Trump is a president of a democratic country, and he does not come for life.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.140]   He is not Putin.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.860]   He will not come for 25 years.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.580]   He will come for his term.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.980]   Please tell me.
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:57.420]   Well, for example, he came for four years, and for the fifth year, Putin came with a
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:58.420]   war.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:03.060]   Will it make Trump feel better that there was no war during his time, and that Ukraine
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.820]   was destroyed after him?
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.660]   Why destroyed?
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.620]   Putin is whoever, a killer whoever, but not a fool.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:15.620]   He will be prepared.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.620]   He knows all mistakes.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:21.620]   He understands how we defeated his army after the invasion began.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.300]   He realized that this was not a Soviet war, and that this would not happen with us.
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.660]   He will prepare.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:30.300]   He will let everything into arms production.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.580]   He will have lots of weapons, and there will be a very large army, and you think that after
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:42.260]   such humiliation, four years without a war, he did not finish us.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:46.720]   He will return and fight only against Ukraine.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.340]   He will destroy everything around.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:53.860]   And if you say there is a risk that Trump, President Trump, will withdraw from NATO,
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.580]   for example, this is a decision of the United States.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:01.820]   I'm simply saying that if it does, Putin will destroy Europe.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.460]   Calculate the size of army in Europe.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.700]   It's just that I say it for a reason.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.560]   Do the calculation.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.540]   Why did Hitler conquer all of Europe then?
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.380]   Almost.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:18.120]   Let's count, remember, his armies of millions.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120]   Calculate what Europe has.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.680]   What are the largest armies?
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.240]   We have the largest army.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:28.600]   The Ukrainian army is the largest in Europe.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.360]   The second place after us is four times smaller than us.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.360]   France.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.360]   Yes.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   200,000?
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.280]   I think the French have about 200,000.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.860]   We have 980.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:44.300]   So this powerful coalition of European nations.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.300]   That will not be enough.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.640]   Yes, it's not going to be enough, but you're a smart man, there's a lot of ideas.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:58.500]   Partnerships with Global South, India, Middle East, Saudi Arabia, economic partnerships,
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.420]   political partnerships.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.660]   It all protects you.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:07.020]   First of all, look at one example.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:11.940]   North Korea, just look at this example.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:16.300]   12,000 has arrived.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:26.380]   Today, 3,800 killed or wounded.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:40.140]   They can bring more, 30,000, 40,000, or maybe 500.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.980]   They can bring many people.
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:43.020]   Why?
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:47.180]   Because they have order, autocracy, and everything.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.980]   Can Europe bring people together?
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.980]   No.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.940]   Will Europe be able to build an army consisting of two to three million people?
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.700]   No, Europe will not want to do this.
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:37:59.740]   And for what?
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.700]   We definitely don't want a world war with you.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.460]   There is no such purpose.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.700]   There is no such purpose as gathering everyone.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.060]   We do not want any war.
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:10.260]   We want to stop the Russians.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:19.220]   And they invite North Korean soldiers, invited.
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:22.260]   Their faces are burned.
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:29.220]   They themselves burn their faces, those who cannot escape, injured or killed.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:34.580]   There's a video, everything I'm telling you, there is evidence of this.
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:39.660]   So that they are not recognizable, right?
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:43.620]   It means, what does it mean?
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:46.380]   It's out of values which share Europe.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.220]   Europe counts.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:54.820]   It means that those guys, they don't count, it's count, yes?
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:57.780]   They don't count the number of people.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.780]   That is the answer.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:38:59.940]   Can they move more?
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.940]   Yes.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.380]   Can they move dozens of thousands?
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.500]   Yes, because we see what they have.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:13.060]   Last year, for example, Europe gave us one million artillery rounds.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:16.340]   We produced a lot ourselves.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:20.300]   But they gave us initiative, it was initiative.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:29.660]   One million artillery rounds and of 155 and etc.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:33.340]   We produced more.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:40.820]   But North Korea gave Putin 3.7, just gave him.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:43.340]   So he also has a deficit for today.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.660]   It means he needs what?
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.540]   He needs time.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:54.140]   But the number of soldiers, yes, and the number of artillery rounds is not everything.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:40:01.540]   As you have said, let's say Donald Trump guarantees security for four years.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:08.500]   You can form partnerships with India, with Saudi Arabia that enforce punishment, the
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:14.340]   stick, on oil prices, for example, if any aggressive action is taken.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:23.100]   You can actually even build, I've met a lot of incredible Ukrainian tech people, IT people.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.340]   You can build great companies that form partnerships with the United States, that form partnerships
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.260]   with China.
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:37.100]   And that is a big leverage against aggression of however many million artillery rounds.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.340]   And that, a sheet of paper, you don't need a sheet of paper of protection.
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:47.100]   Ah, that's you, you, well, when you speak.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.100]   In English.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.100]   In English, yeah.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:54.820]   You don't even need answers, because when you, now we're talking, you already answered
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.500]   on all the questions.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:04.380]   The first one is that during this time, you need just cooperation, a lot of money for
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:13.180]   this military industry in Ukraine or in Europe, with India, Saudi Arabia, Saudi and the United
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:16.300]   States, you need a lot of money.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:18.260]   So the question is where you will get it.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.260]   So my answer was to Trump, I said, this is one of the security guarantees.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:28.100]   Take 300 billions of frozen Russian assets.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:33.180]   We will take it, take money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.540]   all the weapons from the United States.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:38.820]   We don't need gifts from the United States.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.880]   It will be very good for your industry.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.300]   For the United States, we will put money there, Russian money.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.720]   Not Ukrainian, not European, Russian money, Russian assets.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.340]   They have to pay for this.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.460]   We will put it and we will make it.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.740]   This is one of security guarantees.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:55.980]   Yes, of course.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.420]   Because this is a military guarantee, yes.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:07.580]   But then the second you said that energy price and a lot of sanctions on products and the
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.120]   Russian shadow fleet and et cetera.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.660]   That is the second answer we spoke about before.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:16.060]   Yes, put more sanctions on them.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.340]   More sanctions.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.340]   It's okay.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.820]   Not, but not to take off sanctions.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:24.660]   It's okay with you, but it's not going to be okay with the president of Russia.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:28.180]   Yes, but I'm not thinking how it will be very good for him.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.180]   He's still a killer.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:34.580]   I understand, but unfortunately, the reality is that a compromise is needed in order to
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.580]   reach an agreement.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.860]   So in your understanding, the fact that he is no in jail after all the murders, he is
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:45.420]   not in jail assuming all the murders and no one in the world is able to put him in his
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:48.060]   place, send him to prison.
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.660]   Do you think this is a small compromise?
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:55.340]   This is not a small compromise and to forgive him will not be a small compromise.
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.340]   To forgive.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.340]   No one will forgive.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:59.900]   This is absolutely impossible to forgive him.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:03.660]   We cannot get into the head and soul of a person who lost their family.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.700]   Nobody never will accept this.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:07.740]   Absolutely impossible.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.740]   I don't know.
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:09.740]   Do you have children?
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.100]   No, not yet, but I would like to.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.100]   Yes.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:14.100]   God bless.
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:17.180]   And this is the most important thing in life and they simply took away the most precious
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.180]   thing from you.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:23.740]   Will you ask who ruined your life before going to rip their head off?
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:24.780]   I'm just curious.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.300]   They took your child away.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.060]   Are you going to ask who did this?
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.000]   And they will answer that that dude did this.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.260]   You will say, oh, well, then there are no questions.
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.100]   No, no, no.
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:40.500]   You will go fucking hell and bite their head off and it will be fair.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.060]   Can murderers be forgiven?
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.500]   That's why you make security guarantees.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:52.420]   What I told you for those who are here and what we control and what will not happen and
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:57.300]   that those who lost, we will, we will, we will never forget.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.100]   And a matter of time.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:04.680]   But when you gave us NATO, I just said this means that after a while, everything I said
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:12.340]   about NATO, after a while, Ukraine will not go against Russia and Russia will not go against
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.900]   Ukraine because you are in NATO.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.660]   I am just saying is not that a compromise?
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:18.660]   So NATO is a compromise.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:22.420]   This is not just a security guarantee, in my opinion.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:27.060]   Look, when rockets were attacking Israel.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:30.060]   And Israel is not in NATO.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:34.860]   NATO countries, aircrafts were deployed.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.820]   Air defense, the air defense worked.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:44.840]   Operated by different Middle Eastern countries.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.820]   These are also security guarantees.
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:54.920]   And by the way, Israel has nuclear weapons.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.240]   So why do they need NATO when in fact they have more than NATO has?
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.180]   The American, British and French aviation stepped in.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.220]   There was ADA.
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.460]   I don't remember from from Jordan.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:12.420]   Listen, thousands of missiles were shot down that way.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:15.380]   This is this is what is this?
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.580]   So it's a guarantee of safety.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:21.700]   It's just that it's not called NATO.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.540]   Is some Uncle Vova irritated by the word NATO?
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.700]   There's a problem with the word.
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:34.100]   And I think he's simply irritated by people who who are alive and living here.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   If you believe this, it will be very difficult to negotiate.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:43.020]   If you think that the president of a country is completely crazy, it is really hard to
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.700]   come to an agreement with him.
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:50.780]   You have to look at him as a serious person who loves his country and loves the people
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:51.820]   in his country.
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.820]   And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:55.320]   Who are you talking about now?
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.580]   Who loves his country?
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   Putin.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:00.460]   Do you think he doesn't love his country?
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   No.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.460]   What is his country?
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:04.680]   He happened to consider Ukraine his country.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.060]   What is his country?
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060]   Explain it.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.980]   Let's say that it's America.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:11.360]   No pity for the Chechens.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.580]   Do they look like Russians?
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.620]   Do they speak Russian?
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.740]   Of course.
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:22.960]   Of course they learn in schools like anywhere there's been Russification.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.920]   Who are the Chechens?
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.660]   A different people.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.300]   Another faith.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.000]   Other people.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   Another language.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000]   A million.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]   Eliminated.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.280]   Eliminated how?
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.320]   How did he kill them?
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320]   With love?
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320]   I know.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320]   Fuck.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.320]   By hugging.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.920]   In Ukrainian, as we say, strangling by hugging.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.440]   I love you so so much.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.420]   I love you so much that I want to kill you.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.880]   That's his love.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.920]   And that's not love.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.360]   You're mistaken.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.420]   He does not love his people.
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.000]   He loves his inner circle.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.160]   It's only a small part of the people.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.600]   He doesn't love them.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:08.840]   Why?
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.280]   I'll explain.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:22.840]   You cannot send your people to another land to die knowing that they will die.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.280]   Children.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.960]   My daughter.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.960]   My daughter.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.320]   She is 20 years old.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.360]   For me, this is a child.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.040]   She is already an adult.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.000]   Of course.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]   But she is, she is a child.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.960]   The boys, the boys he sends are 18 years old.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.880]   18 years old.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.880]   They are children.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.860]   He sends them.
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:53.720]   It's not that fascists came to his land and he needs to defend it.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.160]   He, he came to ours and he sent them.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:59.480]   Chechnya.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.840]   He sent them.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.840]   Syria.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840]   He sent them.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840]   Africa.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.840]   He sent them.
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:05.840]   Georgia.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.520]   He sent them.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.640]   Moldova, Transnistria, that was before him.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.640]   Fine.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:12.640]   We can leave that aside.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.280]   He has enough sins of his own.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.520]   And, and then there's Ukraine.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.440]   The largest part.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:30.720]   700, 80,000, 788,000 killed or, or wounded.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.800]   Russians.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.600]   He calls them all Russians.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.000]   Even those who don't know, who don't know how to speak, Russian.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.240]   On his territory of Russia, everything they've enslaved, yes, proud Varangians.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.000]   So I wonder, is that love?
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.440]   What love is this?
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.920]   And for what?
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.600]   Does he love his people?
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.880]   No.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.120]   Does he love his land?
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.960]   His country is bigger than America.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.880]   How much land do you need?
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.560]   America is huge.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.120]   America is simply an outstanding country.
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.960]   Outstanding country.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960]   Russia is bigger.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.760]   Well, just bigger.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.160]   So, so ask yourself, does he love them?
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.520]   What is he doing?
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.100]   And what does he love?
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:27.040]   Do you think he's been everywhere in his Russia?
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.700]   It's impossible to get around it.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.720]   He hasn't been everywhere.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720]   He just hasn't.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.740]   Well, I believe that Donald Trump loves America, and I don't think he has been to every single
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.080]   American city.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.880]   No, no, no.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.880]   I saw his rallies.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.880]   So many rallies.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.880]   No, no.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.320]   Let's, let's be honest.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.320]   Let's be honest.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.840]   He had it and I saw it.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.840]   And it's very difficult.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.040]   He's not, I mean, he's not 18.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.360]   Yes, but he's strong.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:56.240]   And this is his will.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.320]   Everywhere where the war is.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.480]   I'm sure.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.640]   I pray to God it never will be on your land.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.640]   Yes.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.260]   And I'm sure that it will not be.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:13.480]   But I'm sure that if you have in some region, the problems, how to say earthquake, hurricane,
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.800]   you have it all.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:21.760]   Well, I'm sure that President Trump would be there.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.680]   After one day, two or three days, I don't know the security of all these things, but
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.680]   he will be.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.800]   Otherwise, how will people look at him?
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.880]   Yes, of course he will.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.160]   Of course.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.800]   The same about me.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.680]   I'm not comparing myself with him.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.560]   I'm just where it is difficult for people, I have to come.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.240]   The question, the next question is very simple.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.400]   Region.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.860]   Kursk region.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:52.560]   The operation there.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:59.440]   Did Putin, was Putin in Kursk during, during four months?
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440]   No.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:05.640]   Listen, I have tremendous respect for you, admiration for many reasons.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.960]   One of which is you stayed in Kiev.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.900]   And another one is that you visit the front and you talk to the soldiers in the front
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.680]   and you talk to people all across Ukraine.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.900]   Absolutely tremendous respect for that.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:27.360]   So, and not enough people say that, you know, I had a conversation with Tucker Carlson,
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:32.360]   for example, and, you know, I said that you're a hero for staying in Kiev and he said, well,
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.480]   he just did a thing that every leader should do.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.680]   But I think not enough leaders do the thing that every leader should do.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.600]   So tremendous respect.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.040]   I agree with you totally.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:48.560]   Yes, a leader should go to the, to the front of a war.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:55.240]   You know, that said, America has waged wars all across the world that has the war in the,
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:52:06.040]   in the, in Afghanistan and Iraq cost $9 trillion and killed over a million people.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.600]   War is hell.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:13.520]   And that just because war is waged in, in, in terrible ways that it is, does not mean
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.120]   the leader does not love their country.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.520]   But I take your point.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:25.520]   I once again have a dream that even if there's hate, that you sit down with Donald Trump
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:31.240]   and Vladimir Putin and you find a way to peace.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:32.700]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.700]   What do you think?
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:38.760]   Will there ever be a day when the Ukrainian people forgive the Russian people and both
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:46.400]   peoples will travel back and forth again and marry each other, rekindle and form friendships?
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.920]   Will there be such a time in the future?
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.240]   I think history has long answered this question.
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.960]   I don't know how it will be for us.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.000]   It will be in the future, without a doubt.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.760]   History has shown this time and again, after every devastating war, one generation, one
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:25.200]   country recognizes that it is, was an aggressor and it comes to realize this is impossible
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.880]   to forgive.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:32.240]   This is precisely the kind of education they've had in Germany for many years, even though
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:34.400]   these children had nothing to do with it.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:42.400]   It was their grandfathers who participated and not all of them were participants of Nazi
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:49.720]   Germany's war against, essentially against the world, yes, and against life.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:55.080]   And therefore, they're still apologizing.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.320]   Apologizing is not easy.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:59.440]   They know that they were the aggressors.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.000]   They were guilty.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.360]   They do not look for compromise in history.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.280]   Compromise in itself buys time.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.440]   And they understand this.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:16.640]   There are convicted murderers condemned both historically and by their own people.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:23.120]   Reparations have been paid and security guarantees have been established by the way and all this
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.200]   is done.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:32.320]   And when all this is done and recognized in any case, people develop relations with
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.320]   each other.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.320]   That's clear.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:41.360]   But it can only happen the way it always has, always has in history.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.360]   Russia will have to apologize.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:45.480]   It will.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:48.600]   This will happen because they are guilty.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:49.600]   They are guilty.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:52.560]   And as I told you, the guilty are different.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:59.600]   Both those who participated and those who remain silent, because silence is also about
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.760]   participating.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.000]   In my opinion.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.680]   Can I ask about Donald Trump?
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.880]   We've already mentioned him a lot, but let's focus there.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:19.240]   What do you admire, what do you respect about Donald Trump?
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:27.280]   And also maybe why do you think he won overwhelmingly the election in 2024 that American people
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.960]   chose him?
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.860]   He was stronger.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:37.240]   He was much more stronger than Kamala Harris, Biden first and then Kamala Harris.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.240]   Yes.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:44.800]   He showed that he can, he can intellectually and physically.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.920]   It was an important point to show that if you want to have a strong country, you have
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:50.920]   to be strong.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:51.920]   And he was strong.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.520]   And this number of rallies, what I said is not a simple thing.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.800]   He showed that he can, he is strong.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.520]   So he doesn't have any questions with his, I mean, this age and et cetera, nothing.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.920]   He is young.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.520]   He is young here and his brains work.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:15.760]   So I think it's important, very important, and of course a lot of interior questions.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:22.100]   I understand the prices and et cetera, economic questions and the questions of you have the
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.560]   questions with other things.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.560]   Immigration.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.560]   A lot of things.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.740]   I understand.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:34.720]   So maybe he answered on those questions which people had.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.080]   One of the questions.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.600]   That he will finish the war.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.760]   That he will finish the war.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.260]   For me, this is the main question.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.200]   But I said that for him, he's the president of the United States.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.440]   For him, his priority is his questions in the United States.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:51.400]   And I understand and I respect it.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:56.440]   But the second he was speaking about the world, yes, he said that he will finish the war.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:07.280]   And I hope very much because I think that our people really support his idea.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.920]   And that's why I said it is for me.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:19.520]   It's very, very important to have enough people around him who will have connections with
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:22.080]   him, with the right things.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.240]   For me, the truth is very right things.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.480]   What's going on really on the battlefield?
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.160]   What's going on really with Putin and Russia?
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.160]   What he really wants, and that is just to have it.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:45.120]   You know, before any decision, you have to be at the same level of information.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:54.960]   And we need, really, we need him to know everything from us, from you, from people in Ukraine,
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:58:02.800]   from people around who are really afraid, afraid that Putin doesn't want to stop the
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.760]   war, afraid that he will come back with his aggression.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:14.040]   So first of all, I should mention that our conversation today will be translated and
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:24.480]   dubbed into Ukrainian, English, Russian, other languages, Spanish, so you're in your voice.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.960]   So there are great guys originally from Poland.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.560]   It's a company called Eleven Labs.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.520]   They've trained an AI.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.760]   Artificial intelligence sounds truly remarkable in your voice.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:41.320]   You have the freedom to speak in any language you choose, but no matter what, you will always
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:45.480]   find yourself returning to speaking in Ukrainian.
[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:49.520]   That is, when you talk about Donald Trump, you can do it in Ukrainian or Russian.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.520]   Everybody understands.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.560]   Everybody understands.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:59:00.160]   But you said that there's some things about the war that maybe Americans don't understand.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.000]   So we talked about Putin.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.160]   We talked about the security guarantees.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:11.000]   But the reality of war, what's happening on the ground, what do you think that people
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.200]   should understand?
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:17.000]   First of all, they have to understand the idea of Putin's war.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.960]   It is very important for him.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:23.320]   I consider this process.
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:30.360]   I think it is very important for him not to give Ukraine independence.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:36.680]   To prevent Ukraine from developing as an independent country, for him, influence, influence on
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:40.360]   Ukraine cannot be lost.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:51.560]   And for him, it is, you know, like, I think for him, this is such a goal in this last
[01:59:51.560 --> 02:00:06.840]   mile and certainly for him, the last mile and of his, of his political life.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:10.280]   And I think that this is the goal for him.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:17.680]   The second story, I do not want to talk about these banalities that he wants to return all
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.680]   the territories of the Soviet Union, influence over them.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.480]   He does this little by little.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.360]   I just don't want to.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.080]   People need to know details.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:30.760]   For example, Georgia, which was headed towards the EU and NATO, completely turns towards
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:36.400]   Russia regardless of of the fact that they have frozen conflicts.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.440]   They have in Abkhazia what we have with Donbass, which is controlled by militant rebels.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.800]   Abkhazia is not developing.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:47.060]   It's just a part, a very beautiful part of Georgia that has died.
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.380]   And if you have the opportunity, then go there someday.
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.800]   You will understand it simply died because Putin wanted to.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.840]   He wanted not to allow them to develop because a frozen conflict means that you will not
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.560]   be accepted in the EU and certainly will not be accepted into NATO.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.120]   Because right now, yes, they do not take you because of a frozen conflict.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:08.600]   And this is what Putin did.
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.100]   It's very important for him not to lose this influence.
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:16.280]   That is, he turned back Georgia, young people, students, everyone leaves.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.280]   And this is a fact.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.820]   Georgia is quite small and they will leave.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:21.380]   They they want to live in Europe.
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:25.420]   They want to develop somebody in the United States, somebody in Europe, somebody in the
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.940]   EU, somebody in Britain.
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:28.300]   He will.
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:33.240]   He will now fight for the Moldovan parliament.
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.840]   This is his second step.
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.860]   You will see in April what happens.
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:42.900]   You will see, oh, he will start turning Moldova away, away from Europe, although they want
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:44.140]   to go there.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.140]   He does not care.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:50.740]   He will be a pro-Russian party and they will do something with the current president because
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:54.080]   she she has she has won the elections.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.620]   She is pro-European.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:58.680]   But he he will turn this back.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.180]   The next steps are completely clear.
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:08.380]   He will do everything wherever he has lost influence, where there was influence, influence
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.220]   of the Soviet Union.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.100]   He'll turn it back as much as possible.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.680]   And we understand at what price you have seen Syria.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:22.700]   You saw these tortures, what we saw in Bucha, what we saw everywhere we came and where our
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:24.300]   territories were occupied.
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.420]   In Syria, the same happened.
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:29.820]   There were a thousand people there and you have seen it.
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:30.820]   Scientists were found.
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.980]   Doctors were found.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:39.940]   It is clear that any people are capable of generating their own opinion.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:43.780]   Show their skills, develop society.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:50.220]   Everyone who can express an opinion, everyone who can shape the independence and maturity
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.900]   of society, such people are not needed.
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:55.540]   And he wants this in Ukraine.
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:03:05.860]   And therefore, everyone should understand that Ukraine is like a large wall.
[02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:12.020]   On that Europe, and if God willing, President Trump does not withdraw from NATO.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:15.260]   Because again, I believe that this is the biggest risk.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:26.380]   I think two steps, two steps that Putin would like to see is a weak NATO and this without
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:35.940]   Trump and a weak Ukraine, which cannot survive on the battlefield, simply cannot survive
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:41.660]   and prevent me from building a strong relationship with Trump.
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:49.180]   I think these two steps, leaving NATO and Ukraine's weakness will lead to a large scale
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:57.940]   war, which Putin will wage on all the territories of that Europe, post-Soviet Europe.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:03.660]   I mean, Soviet Europe, not post-Soviet, but post-World War II period.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:11.900]   That is Soviet Europe, Soviet era Europe, in order to completely control everything
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:12.900]   there.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:13.980]   This is what he will do.
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:21.620]   And besides this, this will happen in any case, even if the U.S. is thinking about leaving
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:26.620]   NATO.
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:33.580]   This war will affect the United States because North Korea is the first sign.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:40.460]   North Korean skills, North Korean knowledge, which they are now gaining from this war.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:48.220]   These include mastering new technologies, large scale drones, missiles, how it works,
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:52.740]   the kind of technological war we have today, cyber war, etc.
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:58.040]   All these skills, Korea will bring home and scale up in that region.
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:04.540]   And this will be a risk for the Pacific region, security first and foremost.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:11.140]   For Japan and for South Korea, they will face these risks 100 percent.
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:19.140]   And it will be clear that Taiwan will also have to face them.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:22.780]   Without this, it is impossible.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:24.420]   This is already happening.
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:27.500]   This is already happening.
[02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:36.300]   Therefore, I think that President Trump has all power to stop Putin and give Ukraine strong
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:40.700]   security guarantees.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.780]   We've been talking for two hours at the pause.
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:44.780]   You want to take the...
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:45.780]   Yeah, we will.
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:47.900]   We will make a pause.
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:49.900]   We can have coffee, right?
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:50.900]   Coffee?
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:52.540]   Let's do it.
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:53.940]   Yeah.
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:54.940]   And give the interpreter.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:57.540]   He's struggling.
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:00.100]   Some water.
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:01.860]   We keep switching languages.
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:06.040]   Like a dragon, you know, three heads, three translators.
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:14.460]   So one of the difficult decisions you had to make when the war began is to enact martial
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:16.580]   law.
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:21.620]   So when you won the presidency, you were the warrior for freedom.
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:25.100]   In fact, this war is for freedom.
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:31.700]   For freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom.
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:37.740]   But a lot of freedoms had to be curtailed, sacrificed in this fight, because there's
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.700]   so much focus on the war.
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.940]   Do you see the tension?
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:43.340]   Do you feel the tension of that?
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:52.180]   The sacrifice that had to be made in democracy, in freedom, in fighting this war.
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:56.780]   In any case, this war is for our freedom.
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:05.740]   Generally speaking, to be honest, when you understand over time, when the war passes,
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:10.980]   you understand that your main values are at home.
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:15.980]   This is your home, your children, your love.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:19.180]   God willing, parents are alive.
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:26.620]   And if, and if not alive, then their memory visiting their grave.
[02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:33.100]   Choosing how to work, how much, preferably choosing where to work.
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.460]   All this is freedom.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.680]   Freedoms are not just a desire.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:39.220]   They are an opportunity.
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:46.340]   In any case, you are right, because war is a limitation of opportunities.
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:51.580]   In any case, you fight for these opportunities.
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:57.100]   Your parents, your parents and God gave you life, right?
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:00.700]   You fight for your life, your life.
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:06.580]   But we need to understand that first there is a war, and then martial law is introduced.
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:09.980]   Martial law is not introduced because someone wanted to.
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:14.100]   You say this is not Pinochet, this is not Pinochet, and so on.
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:16.660]   This is a completely different story.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:18.620]   An aggressor came.
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:23.420]   And according to your legislation, if the border is violated, if there is armed aggression,
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:27.540]   you have all this written down, long ago written out in legislation.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:29.100]   You introduce martial law.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:36.100]   And the introduction of martial law everywhere at all times means, in any case, a restriction
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:37.260]   of opportunities.
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:42.980]   If opportunities are limited, rights and freedoms are restricted, therefore the war itself restricts
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.580]   rights and freedoms.
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:49.260]   Yes, and you can't do anything about it.
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:56.260]   We try, honestly, to balance as much as possible.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:01.820]   I believe that the business sector works despite the difficulties of the war.
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:05.420]   And we do everything somewhere, you know.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:09.020]   There somewhere to reduce some load, unfortunately.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:12.820]   We cannot reduce taxes.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:16.380]   On the contrary, a military tax is used for war.
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:17.940]   You need to take money somewhere.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:23.380]   This, by the way, is about the fact that the US gave us a lot.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.980]   And Europe too.
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:31.080]   But compared to how much we needed for the war, this is not all.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:37.220]   Because for military salaries, you know that we could not pay the salaries of a million
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:38.220]   strong army.
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:41.260]   We could not pay it using the money from our partners.
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:43.460]   These are all expenses.
[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:50.780]   This is all the money that the country and people have accumulated.
[02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:51.780]   You can't do anything.
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:54.660]   I really want to reduce taxes, I will tell you frankly.
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:55.660]   I really want to.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.960]   Well, I think that the whole new tax system, new deregulation, new steps, new reforms,
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.200]   all this will be after the war.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:08.380]   Although there is something to brag about, this is proof.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:19.560]   And this, this is a document because if you want to get a candidacy for European Union,
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:22.320]   you must implement the appropriate number of reforms.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.820]   We do everything.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:30.760]   During the war, we voted for many reforms, including anti-corruption, banking reforms,
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:33.120]   land reforms, major reforms.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:38.040]   We started a large privatization and the war did not stop us.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.480]   Yes, it slowed down, but we went through a lot.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.300]   When do you think you will hold elections?
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:49.040]   Because for people who don't know, part of the martial law elections were suspended and
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.040]   they were delayed and delayed and delayed.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:59.440]   And I think the next sort of plan is in February of 2025, but when do you think there will
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:03.240]   be presidential elections in Ukraine?
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:06.000]   Elections were postponed once.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.520]   They were not delayed, to be clear.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.680]   Elections did not take place in 2024.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:15.660]   That year, first of all, we need to understand the constitution.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:21.040]   They were scheduled to be held in the spring of 2024.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:27.580]   Due to martial law, under the constitution, you cannot do this.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:29.340]   These are the presidential elections.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:38.540]   The parliamentary elections did not take place in the fall of 2024, according to the constitution.
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:40.860]   Yes, there are security things.
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:44.540]   There is the constitution, but there are security things.
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:49.440]   That is, everyone in Ukraine understands that this cannot be done until the war is over
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.980]   or legislation needs to be changed.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:57.240]   I believe that elections will take place immediately after the end of martial law.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.920]   This is according to the law.
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:05.940]   Or members of the parliament need to get together and change legislation, which will be very
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:09.180]   difficult to do because society is against it.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:13.640]   Why is society against it?
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:20.900]   It is understandable why, because we want elections that we want to trust.
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:25.660]   8.5 million people went abroad.
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:31.740]   The infrastructure needs to be created for these millions of people to vote.
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:34.220]   Millions of people in the occupied territories.
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:37.820]   I'm not even talking about the occupation of 2014.
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.220]   I'm talking about the occupation right now.
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:43.740]   What to do with these people?
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:46.020]   This is a difficult question.
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:55.700]   And one of the most unfair ones is how to vote without having a million soldiers.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:57.500]   That is, it is impossible.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:03.700]   We need to think about how to change the system if the elections are held in times of war,
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:09.100]   change the legislation, which should include changes to the voting system, to think about
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:10.620]   online voting.
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:18.840]   Everyone is afraid because of certain attacks, like cyber attacks and so on.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.780]   But we need to think about it.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:28.060]   I really think that it's possible that we can end the war in 2025.
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.060]   In January.
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:30.460]   We've already agreed on it.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.840]   I would very much like to.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:34.820]   I would very much like to.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:35.820]   After the war?
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:37.180]   And immediately.
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:39.700]   Yes, immediately.
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:42.820]   In the year of the end of the war, it's a fact.
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:43.860]   Why?
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:50.500]   Because when martial law ends, you can immediately vote in parliament to hold elections.
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:54.680]   And then everyone, everyone will vote.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:56.700]   Because there are no restrictive measures.
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:02.500]   And after they vote, I think elections can be held in 90 days, something, something like
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:03.780]   that.
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:05.060]   Yes.
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:09.860]   And this means that immediately after the end of the war, elections may take place in
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:10.860]   90 days.
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:14.540]   Are you running for re-election?
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:15.540]   Even I don't know, really.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:16.540]   I don't know.
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:18.380]   I don't know.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:21.420]   It is a very difficult question.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:25.180]   It depends on how this war will finish.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:29.100]   It depends on what people will want.
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:34.540]   Mostly, it depends on people.
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:38.380]   First of all, and of course, my family.
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:47.260]   We had no time to speak about it with my family and of course, didn't have a chance because
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.980]   we don't think about it now.
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:55.580]   I mean, it's something, you know, there are a lot of, some, not a lot of, but enough voices
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:15:03.620]   in Ukraine from politicians, opposition and etc. about this, I guess.
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:10.940]   But we don't think really seriously, didn't think seriously with my family about it.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:12.500]   So, this is war.
[02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:15.060]   I mean, how to think about what will be after.
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:18.660]   It's very difficult, really very difficult.
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:24.940]   If we look at the field of candidates, maybe you can give your opinion about the set of
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:29.700]   ideas you see out there, including your own, about the future of Ukraine.
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:36.780]   As I understand, the candidates include Poroshenko, Zaluzhny, Aistovich, Budanov, Klitschko and
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:38.020]   many others.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.980]   This is the internet speaking to me.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:43.900]   What do you think of the space of ideas that these candidates represent?
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:48.220]   You know, I think it can be, there can be even a bigger number of candidates.
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:51.740]   Yeah, I don't really know what will be.
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:54.420]   They have rights to participate if they want to.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:59.660]   Yes, if they really want to and can, they can go and do what they want.
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.860]   I mean, honestly.
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.540]   Most important is what are they doing now.
[02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:12.940]   I think that all these people are famous Ukrainian people and it's important for them to do everything
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:17.420]   they can today, not begin any election campaign.
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:23.500]   I think this what can divide our people to have the elections, you know, during the war.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:29.540]   I mean, this make steps, speak about elections a lot, you know, make a big mess about it.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.100]   I think this is not right.
[02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:34.460]   That's why I'm not agreeing with some of these people.
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:42.980]   But they can and they, I think that they can and maybe some of them will and it's okay.
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:44.180]   It's normal.
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:45.660]   It's very normal.
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:48.380]   Our system differs from the system in the United States.
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:52.140]   You have two parties and the parties decide who will be the leader.
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:55.020]   And in Ukraine, everybody can participate.
[02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:57.460]   Let them.
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:01.140]   You think you're going to win the debate?
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:06.900]   You versus Zelensky and you decide to run.
[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.020]   Do you think you're going to win the debate?
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:10.740]   Or you're again focused on the war.
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:21.780]   Oh, I'm really focusing on the war and I think the most difficult debate is what will be
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:22.900]   brought to the table.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:24.140]   And we spoke about it.
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:25.820]   It will be during the war.
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:26.820]   How to finish the war.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:33.460]   I think that is my goal because it will be one of my most complicated debates.
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:36.460]   And for any president who is in a war, of course.
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:41.660]   But I think this is my goal to win those debates.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:45.020]   And the other things are not, not for today.
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:53.340]   As I said, the dream I have is it's a historic opportunity to make peace, to make lasting
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:56.180]   peace soon.
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.100]   So I'm glad you're focused on that.
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:01.020]   Let me ask a question about that.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:07.300]   A lot of people in the United States think about, uh, and I, I care a lot about, about
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:10.060]   the future of Ukraine is corruption.
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:14.460]   This is something you have cared a lot about for a long time.
[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:20.780]   You won the presidency 2019 in big part, your message of fighting corruption.
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:26.780]   But there's a lot of accusations that during war, I mentioned $9 trillion in the United
[02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:30.460]   States, war breeds corruption.
[02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:37.300]   So can you speak to that, how you have been fighting corruption and you, can you respond
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:41.940]   to the accusations that has been corruption in Ukraine?
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:42.940]   You know, it's very simple.
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:49.820]   First of all, we really have a very sophisticated anti-corruption system.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:53.500]   Sophisticated not in the sense that it's difficult to understand, but in that it really
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:55.360]   consists of many elements.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.340]   It's the most sophisticated in all of Europe.
[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:02.200]   This is another requirement of the European Union.
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.620]   It was a requirement for Ukraine.
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:08.740]   And for many years, Ukraine was not trusted.
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:15.740]   I want to tell you that under me, we all voted for bills, all the anti-corruption reforms,
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:22.980]   all, well, almost all reforms and all anti-corruption bodies today are independent.
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.900]   They work as requested.
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:28.580]   I still believe that they are not perfect yet.
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:29.580]   There are many issues.
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:35.500]   There is a judicial system, but also a judicial reform that our partners, the United States
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:38.700]   plus the EU demanded from us.
[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:40.200]   This is all written out.
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:46.080]   This is written out in specific laws, in specific decrees, in specific decisions.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:47.400]   We did this.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:50.880]   We've done 99% of this.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:54.500]   If something has not been done, it means that it is on the way.
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:59.120]   But in principle, all this exists and there is no such system as we have in Europe.
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:03.080]   To say that we do not have corruption would be lying.
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:05.640]   We just talk about it openly.
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:07.920]   We are genuinely fighting against it.
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:18.920]   Look, we have sitting in our prison Ihor Kolomoisky, who is the most influential Ukrainian oligarch
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:21.320]   since independence.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:22.840]   And no one could do anything about him.
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:27.120]   The United States of America wanted to have Kolomoisky and they went to great lengths
[02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:29.640]   because of money laundering, et cetera.
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:35.360]   There are criminal cases in the United States, I think in Delaware, something like that.
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.360]   Neither Europe could do anything about it.
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:43.480]   That is, we did a lot with oligarchs, Russian oligarchs, sanctions were imposed.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.680]   They were thrown out.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:49.840]   Some of them fled the state, but they are all under sanctions.
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:55.800]   We exchanged some of them for our soldiers, such as Medvedchuk, to whose daughter Putin
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:58.220]   is godfather.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:07.740]   That is, we fought against the strongest influential oligarchs, which are and were
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:08.740]   in Ukraine.
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:10.380]   And we eliminated a lot of corruption.
[02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:13.340]   Of course, corruption exists in everyday life.
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:14.620]   It exists.
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:19.820]   But institutionally, I am sure that Ukraine will overcome all this.
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:29.180]   This takes a little time, I would say honestly, that, listen, what we call corruption, and
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:32.300]   in some state of the world is called lobbyism.
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:37.140]   But this does not mean that there is no corruption there.
[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:41.740]   Let's take the aid you mentioned during the war.
[02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:46.240]   First of all, we have no money.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:51.460]   We have no money except for the war.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:55.700]   We received weapons from the United States of America, from Europe.
[02:21:55.700 --> 02:22:02.180]   If we take, for example, money from the United States of America, during all this time of
[02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:10.180]   the war, around $177 billion have been voted for or decided upon.
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:13.780]   $177 billion.
[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:15.980]   Let's be honest.
[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:21.020]   We have not received half of this money.
[02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:26.520]   The second point, which is very important, just as an example, is it corruption?
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:29.900]   The first question, whose corruption?
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:32.140]   This is the second.
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:35.980]   Here is just one small example for you.
[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:42.640]   When the United States began to transfer us weapons, it was American money.
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:47.060]   American weapons, money for these weapons.
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:54.620]   I had, as a president, I had cargo jets, not in Ukraine because of the war.
[02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:57.020]   We moved them very quickly to Europe.
[02:22:57.020 --> 02:22:58.420]   We had cargo.
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:05.780]   We have good cargo fleet, very good, because of Antonov.
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:18.660]   So I asked American side to grant me the opportunity because our jets are at another, yeah, airfield.
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:27.700]   And I asked America to give me the opportunity to use our jets for transfer, not to pay a
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.880]   lot.
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:29.880]   To whom?
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:32.440]   To your companies, to American companies.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:36.360]   No, I didn't get this opportunity.
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.920]   My jets stayed put.
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:44.940]   And the United States jets, cargo jets, moved these weapons.
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:48.700]   But everywhere you have to spend money.
[02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:59.080]   So we could get more weapons, but we have to pay for this very expensive fleet.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:02.900]   My question, is this corruption or not?
[02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:04.900]   Or lobbyism?
[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:05.960]   What is it?
[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:08.820]   You mean corruption on the part of the U.S. companies?
[02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:10.140]   Yes, making such decisions.
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.140]   Yes, I got it.
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:16.340]   The lobbying for such decisions involves some companies that make these decisions.
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:19.580]   But I can't be open about it, and I couldn't speak loudly about it.
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:25.380]   I didn't want, nor did I intend to cause any scandals to arise, because otherwise you can
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:27.420]   freeze the support, and that's it.
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:33.200]   And that's why when we talk about corruption, we must ask, who is involved?
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:40.880]   If we had 177, and if we get the half, where is the half?
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.480]   If you will find the second half, you will find corruption.
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:47.980]   There is a perception of corruption.
[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:54.880]   People like Donald Trump and Elon Musk really care about fighting corruption.
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:25:00.680]   What can you say to them to gain their trust that the money is going towards this fight
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:03.400]   for freedom, towards the war effort?
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:08.160]   In most cases, we did not receive money, we received weapons.
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:13.440]   And where we saw risks that something could be a weapon, we would slap everyone on the
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:14.440]   wrist.
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:17.460]   And believe me, this is not only about Ukraine.
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:23.480]   On the supply chain, everywhere, there are some or other people and companies who want
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:26.960]   to make money, because everyone makes money on the war.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.760]   We did not profit from the war.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.760]   If we found someone, believe me, we slapped everyone on the wrist.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:41.240]   And we did that, we did that, and we will continue to do so, because to this day, when
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:47.520]   someone says that Ukraine was selling weapons, and by the way, Russia was the one pushing
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.480]   this narrative, we always responded.
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:56.840]   Our soldiers would kill such people with their own hands without any trial.
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:01.780]   Do you honestly think anyone could steal weapons by the truckload when we ourselves don't have
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:06.600]   enough on the front lines, and yet we have to provide proof to defend ourselves?
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:13.320]   Because when there's an abundance of such misinformation, distrust starts to grow.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.880]   And you're right, people listen to various media outlets, see this, and lose faith in
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:18.960]   you.
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.840]   In the end, you lose trust.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.760]   And with it, you lose support.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:31.240]   Therefore, believe me, we are fighting more against disinformation than against particular
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:39.120]   cases, although I still emphasize once again, at the everyday level, such things are still
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:40.120]   important.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:44.520]   We catch these, these people, and we fight them.
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.000]   I mentioned Elon Musk.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.280]   I would be interested to hear what you think of him, why you respect him as a person, as
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:55.640]   an engineer, as an innovator, as a businessman.
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:00.320]   I would just like to hear from you, what do you think about Elon Musk?
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.220]   First of all, I had a conversation with him at the beginning of the war.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:08.920]   I talked with him.
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:13.000]   I respect him, first and foremost.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]   I respect the self-made man, right?
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.480]   In English, I love such people.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:22.960]   You know, no one and nothing fell into their lap, but the man did something, did it all
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.080]   himself.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:30.080]   I worked myself, created a big production company, and I know what it means to make
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:37.920]   money, to make money, to select talented people, to impart knowledge to them, to invest money,
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.560]   and to create something, something important for certain people, you know.
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.640]   And I'm not, I'm not comparing myself to Musk.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:54.720]   He just, well, the man is a great leader of innovations in the world.
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:59.120]   And I believe that such people move the world forward.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:06.360]   Therefore, I respect the result of his work.
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.480]   And we see this result.
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:13.040]   And for me, it has always been important that your result can be used.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:16.960]   That these are not words, but facts.
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:20.040]   Let's take the war.
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:22.760]   We are very grateful for Starlink.
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.320]   It has helped.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:29.100]   We used it after Russian missile attacks on the energy infrastructure.
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:32.680]   There were problems with the internet, et cetera, with connection.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.600]   We used Starlink both at the front and in kindergartens.
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:38.240]   It was used in schools.
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:39.880]   It helped children.
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:46.280]   We used it in various infrastructure, and it helped us very much.
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:57.000]   And I would very much like Elon to be on our side as much as possible to support us.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.680]   And yes, I am grateful to him for Starlink.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.680]   Truly I am.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:08.320]   First of all, so that our guys have a connection, and children too.
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:13.000]   And I am really, I am really grateful to him for that.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.480]   I think we need, I would like him to come to Ukraine.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:21.560]   To talk to people here, and to look around, and so on.
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:23.960]   Has Elon visited Kiev or Ukraine yet?
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:24.960]   No.
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:27.720]   I hope the Kiev airport will open soon.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:30.200]   Then it will, it will be easier to fly in.
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:34.140]   Yes, I am, I am looking forward to it.
[02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:38.520]   Maybe we will open it, but only, and you must understand if the war is over, there must
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:43.160]   be sustainable peace, and air defense systems to be honest.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.560]   And we must ensure that they are long lasting and effective.
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:52.360]   Let's take the airport for example, and let's focus on the airport in Rzeszów, which you
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:57.600]   know very well as it is handling important cargo for Ukraine in Poland.
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:01.840]   And there are Patriot systems there, because everyone understands what the risk is.
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:06.280]   Well Russia is a risk, and therefore we need air defense systems.
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:12.440]   And today, today take for example the air defense system, of one city or another that
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:19.160]   is being shelled, and move it, move it to the airport, well, that would be dishonest.
[02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:22.720]   People are more important than planes.
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:28.400]   But there will be a moment, and Trump by the way, I think that the war will end, and President
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:33.160]   Trump may be the first leader to travel here by airplane.
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:36.480]   I think it would be, it would be symbolic by airplane.
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:39.480]   Again, January 25th around that date, right?
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:41.760]   Flying in, meeting the Air Force One.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.760]   That would be cool.
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:43.760]   Elon Musk.
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.040]   I will meet you there for the second time too.
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:47.040]   On the plane.
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.040]   With pleasure.
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:55.980]   And you, by the way, before I forget, let me ask, are you coming on January 20th for
[02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:58.040]   President Trump's inauguration?
[02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:02.360]   I would like to, of course.
[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:04.880]   I will be considering.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:07.240]   What is happening then in the war?
[02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:13.320]   Because there are moments of difficulties, escalation, many missiles, etc.
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:16.440]   But honestly, well, I can't.
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:23.200]   I can't come, especially during the war, unless President Trump invites me personally.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:28.280]   I'm not sure it's proper to come because I know that in general leaders are, for some
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:37.000]   reason, not usually invited to the inauguration of presidents of the United States of America.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:44.560]   Well, and I know that there are leaders who can simply come, want to come and will come.
[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.200]   Yeah, I know.
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:51.600]   And I know the temperament of some of these people.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:53.800]   They can come at their discretion.
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:56.720]   This is very, very difficult for me.
[02:31:56.720 --> 02:32:02.360]   I am the kind of person that cannot come without an invitation.
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:03.360]   This is Putin.
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:04.460]   We did not invite him.
[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:06.720]   He came to us, so to say.
[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.280]   And me?
[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:09.520]   I can't do that.
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:13.840]   No, but didn't he publicly say that it would be great if you came to the inauguration?
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:15.560]   Or you mean, did he invite it officially?
[02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:19.760]   Oh, wait, look, look, look, listen, I am against any bureaucracy.
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:28.800]   I get rid of it as, as much as I can, but, well, you know, there are some complexities
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:30.360]   involving security.
[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:37.680]   I decide and I fly and the United States of America officially provides security.
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:39.200]   Not that I need this, mind you.
[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:43.600]   I do not ask for helicopters to fly around and protect me, but they will simply do it
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:44.600]   themselves.
[02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:46.000]   The security service itself.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.220]   They had to do it.
[02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:48.220]   I don't want it.
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:49.720]   And sometimes I don't need it.
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:51.540]   And I'm asking them.
[02:32:51.540 --> 02:32:58.120]   It was, for example, before the war, I think, yes, it was before, before the war, I just,
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:01.240]   I just, I had a meeting, yes, with President Trump.
[02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:02.820]   It was in 2019.
[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:06.780]   I just wanted, just wanted to go for a run early in the morning because I really wanted
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:08.400]   to exercise.
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:14.120]   And they, those tall bodyguards, a lot of them, they decided to join me, but I couldn't
[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:18.320]   really do it because they were in suits and I was in sportswear.
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.080]   I said, no, I can't.
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:21.080]   It's always funny.
[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:28.240]   I'm not, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to disturb anybody and cause anyone problems
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:29.240]   with me.
[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:35.000]   And that's, that's why if, if he will invite me, I will come.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.840]   I thought he invited you.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:37.840]   Yeah.
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:38.840]   Yeah.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:39.840]   I thought he publicly invited you, but okay.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:40.840]   I hope to see you there.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:41.840]   I think they had to.
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:44.640]   I mean, to do some of their steps.
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:45.640]   I don't know, but.
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:46.640]   Step.
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:47.640]   Yeah.
[02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:49.240]   The stamp was missing.
[02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:54.200]   But with pleasure with my wife, of course, and, and I think it's important.
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:55.200]   It's important.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.560]   All right.
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.440]   Let's get back to a serious question.
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.760]   Sometimes they say it in America, this question of who is really in power.
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:06.880]   So let me ask, is someone controlling you?
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:10.840]   For example, oligarchs, American politicians.
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:12.840]   Yeah.
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:13.840]   Yeah.
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:14.840]   Yeah.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:22.640]   I wanted to bring in this up because I have been here in Ukraine since the twice, since
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:25.720]   the invasion of 2022.
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:31.120]   And one of the things I've learned well, is that actually nobody controls you.
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:39.440]   And this is, this is one of your strengths as a president, as a person that oligarchs
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:42.480]   and other rich and powerful people like that cannot control you.
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:44.640]   Can you explain why that is, how you see it?
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:52.920]   I think, and it is indeed true, that I'm generally difficult to deal with.
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:57.120]   I am an ambitious person.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.720]   I can't submit to anyone.
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:02.760]   I can live by rules, by laws.
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:10.040]   I believe that this is the only thing that can control any person today.
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:16.680]   These are the rules and laws of the society or state where you live.
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:20.400]   And I believe that this is the most important thing.
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.720]   There is no person who could control me.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:28.880]   As I once told President Trump, when we had a meeting, by the way, journalists asked if
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.400]   Trump influenced me during the phone call.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.520]   I told him, I told the journalists the truth then, who can influence me?
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:40.480]   Only my, my boy, my son.
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:41.480]   This is a fact.
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:44.960]   When he calls asking for something, well, then I lift up my arms.
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:45.960]   Yes.
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:49.360]   And I cannot do anything about it because children are children.
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:51.080]   I have so little time with them.
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.160]   And therefore, when there are these moments, they are precious and important to me.
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:58.640]   I am ready to do anything.
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:04.400]   So probably my parents, they are an authority for me.
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:09.040]   Beyond that, I view it more as a system.
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.440]   No one can control the president.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:17.100]   Therefore, we have oligarchs who either fled or are in prison because oligarchs usually
[02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:22.040]   control cash flows and people and influence politics.
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:25.440]   And we have concrete examples with sentences.
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.160]   They are not just under house arrest, not just that there are some judgments under which
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:33.640]   their assets were frozen or sanctions were imposed.
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:36.720]   There are specific people who are behind bars.
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:39.400]   I think this is the answer regarding the influence.
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:44.040]   Would they like to influence me in the same way as any president of Ukraine?
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:48.840]   Because finance and cash flows always influence politics.
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:54.080]   Well, at least they want to do this.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.640]   This is regarding the influence.
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:04.160]   And other people on the vertical, they perform tasks as my managers.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:09.200]   Andrey, you mentioned, is one of those managers.
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:15.320]   Well, I am glad that I have such people.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:19.640]   Well, probably there is nothing else to add here.
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:24.640]   I will just say that your team that I spoke with is an excellent team.
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:25.640]   Excellent people.
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:26.640]   Thank you.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:27.640]   Okay.
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:28.640]   One last question.
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:29.640]   The future of Ukraine.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:35.000]   If you look 5, 10, 20 years into the future, what can help Ukraine flourish economically,
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.960]   culturally, politically in the future?
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.320]   Digital.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:41.480]   It's very important.
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:42.840]   Digitalization of all the process.
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:43.840]   We began this work.
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:46.640]   We have special ministry of digital transformation.
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:47.640]   Right.
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:48.640]   Yeah.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:50.560]   And this is very good.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.000]   And we also have our DIA.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.400]   This is the name for all of these services.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.400]   Yeah.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.860]   So I think that is the most important.
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:01.120]   This is, again, this is not only convenient.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:06.880]   That will cancel all the, any possibilities for future corruption.
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:10.760]   Because you don't have any, you know, you don't have any personal connections with people
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:12.640]   in the government or elsewhere.
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.160]   So you're just on your phone or any other device.
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:17.160]   That's it.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:18.880]   I think we are doing very well.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:20.480]   We are the best in Europe.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:22.480]   All of Europe recognizes it.
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:28.720]   Some countries of the African Union asked us to provide this, the same service.
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:31.920]   And we will do it after the war immediately.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:35.480]   And I think that we can bring money to Ukraine from this.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.160]   And I think what we also need, we need a tax reform.
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:43.840]   I think it will be very important for the businesses to return.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:50.720]   A lot of support will come, I think, from USA business investment, not as direct aid
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:55.040]   to us, just to the private sector and resources.
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.600]   And I mentioned this to President Trump and to some European leaders who are our key strategic
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:05.620]   partners that will be happy, especially with the Americans, will be happy to sign these
[02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:12.040]   contracts and engage in joint investments in many areas.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:18.240]   And I think we can we can develop oil, gas, green energy, including solar power.
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:20.240]   And we already have the resources.
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:22.040]   We can invest money into this.
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:27.760]   We have oil reserves in the Black Sea that we can we can exploit.
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:34.080]   And we need your expertise and the investment of your companies.
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:40.200]   We have gold and uranium reserves, the largest in Europe, by the way, which is also very
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.200]   important.
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:45.120]   For example, Russia has pushed France out of Africa.
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:47.340]   They urgently need uranium, which we have.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:50.920]   So we are ready to open up for investments.
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:57.580]   And this will give us, of course, opportunities, jobs for people, revenue.
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:59.920]   I don't want cheap labor, honestly.
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.840]   What I truly want, especially after the war, to open up for those people who can really
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:07.520]   contribute and earn.
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:08.520]   Yes.
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:11.880]   And give a reason to the eight million people to come back.
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:12.880]   Yes.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:14.440]   It's so important.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:19.200]   And they will come and we will recover and rebuild Ukraine.
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:22.040]   We will be very open to companies.
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:25.360]   And of course, we will welcome people back.
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:28.560]   It's so important culturally.
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:33.520]   I think the most important thing is to remain open and not change our direction, because
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:39.280]   culturally aligning with Russia, it's one idea, while aligning with Europe is another.
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:41.240]   Our people have chosen Europe.
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:42.400]   It's their choice.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.360]   It's our choice, the choice of our nation.
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:45.520]   And I think it's very important.
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:47.440]   But first, you have to end the war.
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:48.440]   Yes, you're right.
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:49.760]   And we will.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:55.760]   We want peace, you know, I mean, just to make it clear, we want peace.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:00.360]   Just what I always say, you have to come to Ukraine and see for yourself and people will
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:05.520]   tell you, no, we can't forgive.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:12.680]   Those murders who took our our lives, but we still want to make peace.
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:18.840]   And honestly, I think that the highest approval rating of the president of the United States
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:25.000]   of Trump now is in Ukraine.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.240]   People really believe that he can truly help bring peace.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:40.800]   Now they have faith, faith that he can make it happen, that he can support Ukraine and
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:48.000]   he can stop Putin and that he will make sure Putin doesn't get everything he wants.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.600]   This is very important.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:53.960]   And it's why we believe that we must not lose this opportunity.
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:56.880]   I hope you find the path to peace.
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.880]   Thank you.
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:58.880]   Thank you so much.
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:41:59.880]   Thank you for talking to me.
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:00.880]   Thank you for coming.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:01.880]   Thank you.
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:02.880]   Thank you.
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.880]   I forgot.
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:04.880]   Yeah.
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:05.880]   You started.
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.200]   Thank you very much.
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:16.720]   Thank you for listening to this conversation with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:22.240]   And now let me answer some questions and try to reflect on and articulate some things I've
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:23.720]   been thinking about.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:30.600]   If you would like to submit questions, including in audio and video form, go to lexfriedman.com/ama
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:34.200]   or to contact me for whatever other reason, go to lexfriedman.com/contact.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:40.040]   First, I got a bunch of questions about this.
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:46.360]   So let me chat about the topic of language and let's say the mechanics of multilingual
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.220]   conversation.
[02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:50.800]   Perhaps the details are interesting to some people.
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:56.560]   It also allows me to reflect back on the puzzle of it in this episode and what I can do better
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:58.320]   next time.
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:03.320]   I already explained in the intro the symbolic, historic, and geopolitical complexity of the
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:08.120]   choice of language in the conversation with president Zelensky.
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:12.920]   As I said, the Russian language is one that the president speaks fluently and was his
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:15.280]   primary language for most of his life.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:18.840]   I speak Russian fluently as well.
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:23.640]   It's the only common language we are both fluent in, so any other combination of languages
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:28.060]   required an interpreter, including when I spoke English.
[02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:35.200]   He did need an interpreter when I spoke English and, just like I was, was visibly encumbered
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:39.040]   and annoyed by the process of interpretation.
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:42.960]   This is why I tried to speak in Russian to the president instead of English, so that
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:46.960]   he can directly understand me without an interpreter.
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:51.640]   I'm willing to take the hit for that, as I am for everything else.
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:53.240]   I'm not trying to protect myself.
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:59.400]   I'm trying to do whatever is best for the conversation, for understanding.
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:06.440]   Though it has been getting harder and harder to stay open, vulnerable, and raw in public,
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:13.320]   while the swarms of chanting internet mobs stop by with their torches and their color-coded
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:17.240]   hats, flags, frogs, pronouns, and hashtags.
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:23.600]   Anyway, there is a lot of nuanced aspects of the conversational language that I would
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:24.880]   like to explain here.
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:27.000]   I'll try to be brief.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.760]   I can recommend a lot of books on this topic of language and communication that reveal
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:33.760]   just how amazing this technology of language is.
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.160]   For example, for a good overview, I recommend John McWhorter's books and especially his
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:43.440]   lecture series for the great courses on language, there are several.
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:50.160]   In the "Story of Human Language" series, he gives a great discussion on spoken language
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:55.320]   versus written language, and that spoken language often relaxes the rules of communication.
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:02.040]   It uses shorter packets of words, loads in a bunch of subtle cues and meanings, all of
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:08.560]   which, like I'm trying to describe, are lost when there's an interpreter in the loop.
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:16.720]   Let me also describe some relevant characteristics of my "peculiar language abilities."
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:18.760]   I was never good at speaking.
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:22.000]   I listen, think, and understand better than I speak.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:28.840]   For me, this is true for both English and Russian, but it is especially true for Russian.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:34.640]   The Russian language allows for much more room for wit, nonstandard terms of phrase,
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:41.480]   metaphors, humor, rhyme, musicality, and, let's say, deforming of words that create
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:45.720]   a lot of room for creativity in how meaning and emotion are conveyed.
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:48.080]   You can do the same in English, but it's harder.
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:53.520]   I actually find that Brits are sometimes very good at this.
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:58.640]   One of my favorite humans to talk to is Douglas Murray, setting the content of the conversation
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:04.880]   aside, the sheer linguistic brilliance and wit of dialogue with Douglas is a journey
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:06.680]   in itself.
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:13.360]   I think Christopher Hitchens had the same, and many others, like I said, especially Brits.
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:20.200]   Anyway, I'm able to detect and understand a lot of dynamism and humor in the Russian
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.200]   language, but I'm slow to generate it, in part because I just don't practice.
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:28.520]   I have very few Russian-speaking friends.
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:34.960]   Funny enough, most of them are Ukrainian, but they speak with me and each other in Russian.
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:40.040]   But of course, as I mentioned, this is slowly changing due to the war.
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.080]   But I try to speak to the President in Russian so he would avoid needing an interpreter as
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:47.280]   much as possible.
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:52.400]   One of the things I want to improve for next time is to make sure I get very good equipment
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:58.440]   for interpretation and arrange for an interpreter I trust to be exceptionally good for the dynamism
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:05.480]   and the endurance of a three-hour conversation in the style that I try to do.
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:10.480]   Just to give you some behind-the-scenes details of the experience, so equipment-wise, funny
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:16.760]   enough, it's not actually so trivial to set up wireless connections from us, the two people
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.280]   talking, to the interpreter, and then back to us in a way that's super robust and has
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:24.160]   clean audio.
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:29.160]   The audio I had in my ear from the interpreter had a loud background noise, so the whole
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:38.560]   time I'm hearing a "shhh" sound with the voice of the interpreter coming in very quietly.
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.360]   What a wonderful experience this whole life is, frankly.
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:48.560]   Plus his translation was often incomplete, at least for me, so I had to put together
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:54.960]   those puzzle pieces continuously, but again, it worked out, and hopefully our constant
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:00.800]   switching of languages and having a meta-discussion about language provided good insights as to
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:06.000]   the complexity of this fight for our nation's identity and sovereignty that Ukraine is going
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000]   through.
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:15.240]   Behind-the-scenes, off-mic, on a personal level, President Zelensky was funny, thoughtful,
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:20.880]   and just a kind-hearted person, and really, the whole team were just great people.
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:24.600]   It was an experience I'll never forget.
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:28.600]   After the conversation was recorded, the next challenge was to translate all of this and
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:35.720]   overdub it and do it super quickly, like these words I'm speaking now have to be translated
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.080]   and dubbed into Ukrainian and Russian.
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:45.320]   11 Labs were really helpful here, especially in bringing the President's voice to life
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:51.680]   in different languages, but even more than that, they're just an amazing team who inspired
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:54.080]   me and everyone involved.
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.320]   Please go support 11 Labs.
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:00.240]   They are a great company and great people.
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:08.300]   The translation is separate from the text-to-speech and was done in part by AI and a lot by human.
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:12.600]   This is where the fact that we had constant switching between three languages was a real
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:13.600]   challenge.
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.400]   So there are six transition mappings that have to be done.
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:22.960]   English to Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian to English and Russian, and then Russian to
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:32.240]   English and Ukrainian, continuously, sentence-by-sentence, sometimes word-by-word, and each combination
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:36.980]   of language-to-language translation is best done by a person who specializes in that kind
[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:38.280]   of mapping.
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:41.440]   So it was all a beautiful mess, all of it.
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:44.800]   And on top of all that, great translation is super hard.
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:49.840]   For example, I've read and listened to a lot of the CF scheme, both English and Russian,
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:54.620]   and studied the process of how these books are translated by various translators.
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:50:00.240]   You can spend a week discussing how to translate a single important sentence well.
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:06.560]   Obviously, in this situation, we don't have weeks, we have hours for the whole thing.
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.320]   One of the things I regret is not putting enough time into the hiring and selecting
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:15.800]   great translators, from Russian and Ukrainian to English, especially.
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:17.920]   I think translation is an art.
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:23.560]   So getting a good translator that works well with us is a process that needs more time
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:24.560]   and effort.
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:27.400]   I'll be doing that more this month.
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:32.180]   By the way, we have a small but amazing team.
[02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:35.460]   If you want to join us, go to LexFreeman.com/hiring.
[02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:40.000]   If you're passionate, work hard, and everyone on the team loves working with you, then we'll
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.600]   do some epic stuff together.
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:43.640]   We'd love to work with you.
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:48.560]   Like I said about Eleven Labs, there are few things as awesome in life as being able to
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:54.080]   work hard with an amazing team towards a mission all of us are passionate about.
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:58.160]   Anyway, I'll probably be doing a few more interviews in the Russian language.
[02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:04.000]   I do have a lingering goal of interviewing the mathematician Grigory Perlman, but there
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.960]   are also others.
[02:51:05.960 --> 02:51:11.460]   I will also work on improving my whole pipeline, both equipment-wise and interpreter-wise,
[02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:15.000]   in doing these conversations in other languages.
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:19.040]   Because there are many that I would like to do in languages I don't speak at all, like
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:24.700]   Chinese, Mandarin, or Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, French, German.
[02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:30.880]   I see language as both a barrier for communication and a portal into understanding the spirit
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:34.240]   of a people connected by that language.
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:38.360]   It's all a weird and beautiful puzzle, and I'm just excited to get the chance to explore
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:39.360]   it.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:44.460]   Alright, I got a question on how I prepare for podcasts.
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:49.000]   So this has evolved and expanded more and more over time.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.860]   There are some podcasts that I prepare hundreds of hours for.
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:58.580]   In AI terms, let's say, first I'm training a solid background model by consuming as much
[02:51:58.580 --> 02:52:01.060]   variety on the topic as possible.
[02:52:01.060 --> 02:52:06.800]   A lot of this comes down to picking high-signal sources, whether it's blogs, books, podcasts,
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:09.980]   YouTube videos, ex-accounts, and so on.
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:16.480]   For this conversation with President Zelensky, for example, since February 2022, I've spoken
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:23.040]   with hundreds of people on the ground, I've read Kindle or audiobook about 10 books fully,
[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:28.520]   and then I skimmed about 20 more.
[02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:32.960]   And I don't mean books about Zelensky, although he does appear in some of them, I mean books
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:38.740]   where this conversation was fully in the back of my mind as I'm reading the book.
[02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:46.600]   So for example, I read "Red Famine" by Anna Appelbaum, it's about Holodomor.
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:48.760]   Does it directly relate to Zelensky?
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:53.720]   Not on the surface, no, but it sort of continues to weave the fabric of my understanding of
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:57.080]   a people, of the history of the region.
[02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:02.680]   But it's really important for me to read books from various perspectives, and I'm always
[02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:08.920]   trying to calculate the bias under which the author operates, and adjusting for that in
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:12.580]   my brain as I integrate the information.
[02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:18.480]   For example, Anna Appelbaum's book "Gulag" is very different from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:20.560]   "Gulag Archipelago".
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:28.120]   The former is a rigorous, comprehensive historical account, the latter is a literary, psychological,
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:31.080]   and personal portrait of Soviet society.
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:34.800]   Both, I think, are extremely valuable.
[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:39.360]   On the bias front, for example, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" by William Shire
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:40.640]   is a good example.
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:42.320]   It is full of bias.
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:48.280]   But he was there, and to me, he has written probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:50.240]   book on the Third Reich ever.
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:54.880]   But like I said, it has a lot of inaccuracies and biases, you can read about them online
[02:53:54.880 --> 02:54:01.280]   if you like, but my job in this case, and in all cases, is to adjust based on my understanding
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:06.360]   of the author's biases, and take the wisdom from the text where it can be found, and putting
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:12.040]   the inaccuracies aside into the proverbial dustbins of history.
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:17.000]   So as I'm reading, I'm writing down my thoughts as they come up, always digging for some deeper
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.320]   insight about human nature.
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:27.040]   If I'm at my computer, I'll write it down in Google Doc, sometimes use Notion or Obsidian.
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:29.440]   If I'm not at my computer, I'll use Google Keep.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:34.080]   So for example, if I'm listening to an audiobook and I'm running along the river, if a good
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:40.360]   idea comes to mind, I'll stop, think for a few seconds, and then do a speech-to-text
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:42.120]   note in Google Keep.
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:47.920]   By the way, listening to audiobook at 1x speed.
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.440]   Old school.
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:54.960]   And eventually I get a gigantic pile of thoughts and notes that I look over to refresh my memory,
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:58.440]   but for the most part, I just throw them out.
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:01.140]   It's a background model building process.
[02:55:01.140 --> 02:55:05.840]   By the way, LLMs are increasingly becoming useful here for organization purposes, but
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:11.700]   have not yet been useful, at least for me, and I do try a lot for insight extraction
[02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:14.720]   or insight generation purposes.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:21.640]   I should mention that my memory for specific facts, names, dates, quotes, is terrible.
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:24.240]   What I remember well is high-level ideas.
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:27.160]   That's just how my brain works, for better or for worse.
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:34.000]   I realize that sometimes forgetting all of the details and the words needed to express
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.940]   them makes me sound simplistic and even unprepared.
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:40.600]   I'm not.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:41.600]   But that's life.
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:44.980]   We have to accept our flaws and roll with them.
[02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:49.320]   Aside from books, I also listen to a lot of podcasts and YouTube videos where people are
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:51.020]   talking about the topic.
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:56.240]   So for the President Zelensky episode, I listened probably to hundreds of hours of content from
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:59.600]   his supporters and from his critics, from all sides.
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:06.000]   Again, I choose who to listen to based not on their perspective, but based on SNR, signal
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:07.560]   to noise ratio.
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:12.320]   If I'm regularly getting insights from a person, I will continue listening to them,
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:13.760]   whether I agree or disagree.
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:18.440]   In the end, this turns out to be a lot of hours of prep, but to say that it's X hours
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:22.800]   per episode is not accurate because a lot of this preparation transfers from one guest
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.120]   to another, even when there's an insane level of variety in the guests.
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:29.320]   We're all humans, after all.
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:35.480]   There is a thread that connects all of it together, somehow, if you look closely enough.
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:41.920]   For more technical guests in STEM fields, I'll read papers, a lot of papers, and also
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:44.920]   technical blog posts and technical tweet threads.
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:47.000]   This is a very different process.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:52.200]   For AI or CS-related topics, I will run other people's code, I will write my own, implement
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:53.700]   stuff from scratch.
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:57.980]   If it's a software company, I'll use their tools and software if relevant, but in the
[02:56:57.980 --> 02:57:04.120]   actual conversation, I constantly am searching for simple but profound insights at various
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:05.880]   levels of abstraction.
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:12.120]   Sometimes, this means asking a trivial question in hopes of uncovering the non-trivial, counterintuitive
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:18.160]   but fundamental idea that opens the door to a whole new way of looking at the field.
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:21.920]   And actually, every guest is their own puzzle.
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:27.360]   Like preparing for Rick Rubin was me listening to hundreds of songs he produced, and even
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:31.600]   learning some on guitar, like "Hurt" by Danny Cash.
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:38.280]   Preparing for the Cursor team episode meant, obviously, I had to use Cursor fully for several
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:43.480]   weeks, all of its features, so I switched completely from VS Code to Cursor.
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:51.200]   For Paul Rosely, round two, especially, I literally went deep into the jungle with Paul,
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:57.040]   and almost died, fully taking the leap toward adventure with him.
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:00.880]   When it gets close to the conversation, I'll start working on the actual interview questions
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:07.040]   and notes, and there I'm asking myself, "What am I personally curious about?"
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:13.800]   Like, I love podcasts, I'm a big fan of many, many podcasts, and so I ask myself, "What
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:16.960]   would I want this person to explain on a podcast?"
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:21.880]   And maybe, "What aspect of their thought process or their humanity would I want to
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:26.240]   be surfaced, or have the chance to be surfaced?"
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:31.280]   In the actual conversation, I always try to put my ego aside completely and do whatever
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:35.520]   it takes to have a good conversation and serve the listener.
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:41.560]   This means asking questions simply, trying to define terms and give context if needed,
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:47.400]   being open-minded, vulnerable, curious, and challenging the guests when needed.
[02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:52.320]   Despite the claims on the internet, I do ask a lot of challenging questions, including
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:55.520]   follow-ups, but always with empathy.
[02:58:55.520 --> 02:59:00.720]   I don't need to be right, I don't need to signal my moral or intellectual superiority
[02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:01.720]   to anyone.
[02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:06.880]   I try to do the opposite, actually, because I want the guest to open up, and I trust the
[02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:12.640]   intelligence of the listener to see for themselves if the guest is full of shit or not, to detect
[02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:18.880]   the flaws and the strengths of how the guest thinks or who they are deep down.
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:23.680]   A lot of times when interviewers grill the guest, it doesn't reveal much, except give
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:29.120]   a dopamine hit to the echo chambers who hate the guest.
[02:59:29.120 --> 02:59:33.240]   As I said in the intro, I believe the line between good and evil does run through the
[02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:35.800]   heart of every man.
[02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:39.100]   The resulting conversations are sometimes a failure.
[02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:43.520]   Sometimes because they are too short, sometimes because the chemistry was just not working,
[02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:46.960]   sometimes because I fucked it up.
[02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:52.160]   I try to take risks, give it everything I got, and enjoy the rollercoaster of it all,
[02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:54.260]   no matter what.
[02:59:54.260 --> 02:59:59.520]   And as I said, I trust the listener to put it all together, and I trust the critic to
[02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:01.240]   tear it apart.
[03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:03.560]   And I love you all for it.
[03:00:03.560 --> 03:00:09.420]   Alright, I got a bit of a fun question, it's a long one.
[03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:15.000]   So Deleon, cool name, wrote in saying he spotted me out in the wild and had a question about
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.000]   it.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:21.200]   He wrote, "I saw Lex working at the Detroit airport between flights.
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:25.760]   I hesitated and ultimately decided not to interrupt since he was in focus mode."
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:26.760]   True.
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:32.440]   "Lex had his headphones/earbuds on, listening to brown noise, Microsoft Surface propped
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:35.400]   up at eye level, Kinesis Advantage keyboard on the table.
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:40.200]   The use of Microsoft Windows is surprising, but it has been discussed in the past."
[03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:41.200]   True.
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:47.480]   "The ergonomics of the setup, Surface at eye level, means that Lex cares about his health,
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.640]   but the anomalously large Kinesis Advantage keyboard seems like such a burden to lug around
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:53.640]   airports.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:58.080]   I cannot help but ask, why is it that Lex is going through the hassle to bring this
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:01.360]   absolutely large keyboard with him as carry-on?
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:04.680]   It barely fits in a backpack.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:07.360]   Carrying it around must be necessary for Lex for some reason."
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:10.200]   I love the puzzle of this, that you're trying to think through this.
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:14.480]   "The pain of lugging this tool around must be much smaller than the problem it solves
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:16.120]   for him?"
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.880]   What problem does this keyboard solve?
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:21.320]   What makes it necessary at the airport?
[03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:22.320]   Productivity?
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:23.320]   Health?
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:24.320]   RSI?
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:25.320]   Good questions.
[03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:27.560]   Thank you, Delia.
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:28.560]   Great question.
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:30.680]   It made me smile, so I thought I'd answer.
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:32.480]   I remember that day.
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.980]   There was something else about that day, aside from the keyboard, that I miss.
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:44.880]   So I am filled with a melancholy feeling that is appropriate for the holiday season.
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:50.080]   So let me try to set the melancholy feeling aside, answer a question about my computer
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.160]   setup when I'm traveling.
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:02:00.240]   So whether I'm going to SF, Boston, Austin, London, or the front in Ukraine, I am always
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:03.280]   bringing the Kinesis keyboard.
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:08.960]   I don't have RSI or any other health issues of that kind that I'm aware of.
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:15.440]   Even though I've been programming, playing guitar, doing all kinds of combat sports my
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:21.320]   whole life, all of which put my hands and fingers in a lot of precarious positions and
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:22.320]   situations.
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:27.760]   For that reason, and in general, ergonomics have never been a big concern for me.
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:33.160]   I can work in a crappy chair and table, sleep on the floor.
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:34.480]   It's all great.
[03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:36.600]   I'm happy with all of it.
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:45.760]   So why Kinesis, which by the way is right here?
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:46.860]   I had to think about it.
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:51.180]   Your question actually made me reflect, and I was hoping as I'm answering it, the truth
[03:02:51.180 --> 03:02:54.400]   will come out on many levels.
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:56.480]   So it is true that I'm more productive with it.
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:02.360]   I can type and correct mistakes very fast compared to a regular keyboard, both in natural
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:05.280]   language typing and in programming.
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:14.160]   So fast enough, I think, where it feels like I can think freely without the physical bottlenecks
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:18.560]   and constraints of fingers moving.
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:24.680]   The bitrate in Neuralink parlance is high enough for me to not feel like there is cognitive
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:26.480]   friction of any kind.
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:29.960]   But the real answer, maybe the deeper, more honest answer is something else.
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:34.120]   I've used the Kinesis keyboard for over 20 years.
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:41.020]   So maybe it's like one of those love stories, where a guy and a girl love each other.
[03:03:41.020 --> 03:03:45.360]   And you try to quit because it doesn't quite work, but every time you leave, you ask yourself
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:46.360]   why.
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:53.360]   And then you realize that when you're together, your life is just full of simple joys.
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:56.040]   So what's the point of leaving?
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:01.040]   What's the point of life if not to keep close to you the things that bring you joy, Deleon?
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:04.640]   Like this keyboard, it brings me joy.
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:11.760]   It's a bad metaphor, over anthropomorphized, perhaps, but I never promised a good one.
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:14.000]   I'm like a cheap motel on a road trip.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.920]   Low quality is part of the charm.
[03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:19.440]   I do have some good motel stories for another time.
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:22.500]   This does not feel like the appropriate time.
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:28.560]   All that said, to disagree with myself, I did use Emacs also for over 20 years, and
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:34.220]   in a single week recently switched to VS Code, and then Cursor, and never looked back.
[03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:38.740]   So take my romantic nature with a grain of salt.
[03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:43.640]   So yes, eventually I'll have to leave, but for now, you'll keep finding me on occasion
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:48.340]   in a random airport somewhere listening to brown noise, writing away the hours on this
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:50.080]   Kinesis keyboard.
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:56.960]   Now if you see me without it, maybe it'll give you the same tinge of melancholy feeling
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.960]   I feel now.
[03:04:57.960 --> 03:05:02.280]   You're looking back to that airport in Detroit.
[03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:07.320]   Anyway, more about my travel setup, if anyone is curious.
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:12.440]   I usually do travel with a Windows laptop, but I am mostly using Linux on it through
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:19.680]   WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and in some cases I'm dual booting Linux and Windows.
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:25.360]   I also need to be able to video edit, so on longer trips, I usually have a bigger laptop
[03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:28.680]   with a bigger screen, lots of memory, good CPU, good GPU.
[03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:33.000]   All of that helps with video editing on Adobe Premiere.
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:40.600]   In general, I'm extremely minimalist, except for the few, let's call them sentimental things,
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:44.760]   like all my podcast recording equipment fits into a small suitcase.
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:47.080]   I try to keep it as simple as possible.
[03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:51.040]   Thank you for the question, and see you at the next airport.
[03:05:51.040 --> 03:05:55.120]   All right, I think it's time to bring things to a close.
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:06:01.480]   I'd like to give a big thanks to you for giving me your time and your support over the years.
[03:06:01.480 --> 03:06:03.240]   It means the world.
[03:06:03.240 --> 03:06:07.320]   If you want to get in touch with me, go to lexfriedman.com/contact.
[03:06:07.320 --> 03:06:13.840]   There you can get feedback, ask questions, request guests for the podcast, or submit
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:19.200]   the Coffee with Lex forum if you just want to chat with me over a cup of coffee.
[03:06:19.200 --> 03:06:22.960]   I'll be traveling across the world a bunch this year, from Europe to South America and
[03:06:22.960 --> 03:06:28.160]   more, so it would be cool to do some small meetups and meet some interesting people.
[03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:31.360]   This has been a journey of a lifetime.
[03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:34.400]   Thank you for everything.
[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:36.120]   On to the next adventure.
[03:06:36.120 --> 03:06:36.840]   I love you all.
[03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:46.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
