[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 176.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:23.800]   I'm here as always in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.880]   We're going to do a good old fashioned listener calls episode, right, Jesse?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.280]   We've got some calls that we're going to get through.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.880]   Yep.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.160]   Got five good calls.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   Take a listen.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.200]   I'm still interested in this idea of doing some of these live.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.960]   Have we figured out if that's technically possible or is this one of these things?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920]   If we try that, essentially the power grid in Maryland will go down.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600]   The two inches of snow already did that, but I think we can do it.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.840]   Yeah, we should try it.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.480]   We should try.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   I think that'd be cool.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.640]   Or, you know, I did, um, I did a thing for a charity and maybe
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.480]   this will give us some sense of what we would expect.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480]   I did a thing for a charity a few months ago where I auctioned
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440]   off like a, basically like a call.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.280]   You know, it was sort of like a private episode of Deep Questions, but it was
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.200]   just like a Zoom call for like a half hour.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.480]   It was cool.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.320]   So I got to just hear from, uh, and then I doubled it because it was pretty popular.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.800]   So I was like, well, just I'll do two because there was two bidders
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.640]   that were real near each other.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.960]   So I was like, well, let's double the money.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.560]   And so like, I'll do two.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.080]   And it was an interesting, um, preview, I guess, uh, about what, what that could be like.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.760]   And I would say they were pretty, they were pretty excited.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.680]   So I don't know that we'd have to, we'd have to, that's something to keep in mind.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.320]   I think they were pretty excited to be talking.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920]   It was weird for them.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.240]   So that's something we'd have to get over.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.800]   We have to get people used to like the, the, like, yeah, so you just talk to me.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.440]   It's like a thing.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.640]   It's not an unusual thing.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.600]   And then they can add counter questions to their initial questions.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.600]   And I could ask follow-ups, which I think would be cool.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   Um, yeah.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600]   And we would charge a huge amount of money.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   So only the richest people could get wisdom and everyone else will be screwed.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.400]   That's the, that'd be the key to it.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.560]   Uh, but no, we won't do that.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.000]   All right, cool.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.880]   So we're gonna try to figure that out.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.520]   I think that'd be fun.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.720]   A huge logistical headache.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.160]   I'm sure.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   Because they have to be on zoom and waiting and we do the episodes live.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280]   So they'd have to kind of call in, but we could figure it out.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.680]   I think it'd be cool.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.760]   All right.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.040]   Well, uh, so we, we got some cool calls today.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.880]   Uh, I wanted to first do something we haven't done in a little while, which
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   is an old fashioned deep dive.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   We've been doing some core idea videos because I've been trying to populate
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.880]   our playlist of here are the main ideas that we do on this show, but I want to
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.760]   get into this a good old fashioned deep dive, just a random idea on my mind
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120]   that I want to try to dig into more.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.560]   So let's do a deep dive to start today's episode.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   And the question I want to tackle is the following is tech talk a good thing.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   No, it seems like an unusual question for me to be asking.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   There's a lot about this service tech talk that does not exactly seem to be
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.040]   right up my Cal Newport style alley.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.840]   Right.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.360]   I mean, I am not a huge fan of the fact that they are trying to basically cut
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.960]   out the middleman and just make a direct path to your brainstem.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.400]   It takes addictive entertainment and says, well, can't we just pump that up to 11?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   Instead of making this accidentally addictive, we actually just get the
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.560]   absolute perfect format with the exact right music cues and just shoot these
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.040]   things that people want after another with an algorithm driving it.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.720]   I don't love that.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.000]   I don't love the fact that they manipulate.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.560]   The content creators, emotional systems to get them to spend more time doing it.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.240]   Tick-tock just says they admit it.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.760]   We manipulate your views like a slot machine that gives you a few quarters
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.640]   every once in a while so that you'll keep pulling that proverbial handle.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.040]   So if you're a new to tick-tock, they will early on show your video to a lot
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.280]   of people, so you feel like you're right on the cusp of breaking out that people
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240]   really like what you have to do, that you have this audience out there and
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.760]   then they pull it back, they withhold.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.520]   No views, no views.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.600]   And they'll show it to a lot more people, another video and you're like,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.360]   Oh, I'm almost there.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.200]   I got to keep going.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.640]   I'm, I almost had three cherries.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   And if I get three cherries, I'm going to be Kim Kardashian.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   I don't love all that.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.520]   Wouldn't be my favorite thing to do, but I'm very interested in, I have a very
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.760]   optimistic view on tick-tock because I believe it represents an evolution.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.720]   In the social media industry that ultimately is a very positive evolution.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.800]   We've talked about this before in various question answers scattered
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.000]   throughout recent episodes.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.400]   I wanted to consolidate these thoughts right here into this deep dive.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   Starting around 2012, 2013, we entered this period of monopoly social media
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.600]   platforms that brought with them, and this was the key part, an
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.720]   expectation of universal usage.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.880]   So there was this era of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and a few other
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.560]   claimants to the throne that came and went, where not only did everyone use
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800]   them, but it was weird if you didn't.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.280]   And again, I talk about this a lot on this show, but I know that from
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.000]   firsthand experience because I was pilloried for not using these services.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.880]   It was considered extreme.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.160]   It was considered monastic and unusual.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.640]   There is people that were driven to anger by the concept that I wasn't
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   on these platforms that wanted to debate me publicly and couldn't imagine it.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.800]   I was ambushed on national radio shows, the New York Times commissioned
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.920]   op-eds just about the weirdness of not taking social media
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.480]   serious and Cal not using it.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.000]   I mean, it was a technology that was assumed you had to use.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.640]   And this was the piece of the social media revolution that always
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.840]   made me really uncomfortable.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.360]   I used to say this again and again.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.160]   I think social media should be like Game of Thrones, something that a lot of
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.120]   people really like and enjoy, but there's also a ton of people that
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   have nothing to do with it.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.760]   And that's what it should be like.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.480]   And it wasn't.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   It was like, if you didn't know what the dragon riders spells were in Game of
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.920]   Thrones, you were going to be yelled at.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.200]   That's what it was like for a while.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.080]   TikTok represents something different.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.640]   TikTok is pure entertainment.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.280]   And the way we got to TikTok, the way we got there is that the social media
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.320]   services that we've talked about before on the show, they used to be about
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.200]   connection, it used to be about everyone you know is on here.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.680]   This is where everyone is.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.840]   This will connect you to those people, people you know, you have to use our
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   service because your cousin's not on this new service, your cousin's on Facebook.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.360]   If you want to know what your cousin's up to, you have to be on Facebook.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.080]   And then they shifted and said, how do we get these people to click on our app more?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.600]   And they said, let's be about entertainment.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.120]   We'll give you a newsfeed or infinite scroll timeline of
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.400]   interesting things to look at.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.160]   So they shifted away from connecting you to people, you know, in towards
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.800]   let's give you a infinite scrolling torrent of algorithmically optimized
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.840]   content, and it was in that world that TikTok said, hold my beer.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.440]   That's what we're doing.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.280]   Why don't we just do that?
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.680]   Well, forget like post from your cousin.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.120]   Forget, you know, Ben Shapiro articles being retweeted.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.880]   Let's just go straight to the jugular here, videos with music and they move
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.600]   really fast and they're short and it's one after another, one after another,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.000]   one after another, and we aggressively use algorithms to find the video
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.880]   that you really want to watch.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.120]   They just cut out the middleman and purified this infinite
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.920]   stream entertainment model.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   And the reason why this is a good thing is that it does not bring with it
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.720]   an expectation of universal usage.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.440]   Yes, TikTok is very popular right now.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.720]   There's over a billion users worldwide.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   That's a very popular service, but no one thinks it's weird if you don't use it.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.000]   If I say I don't use TikTok, people say, I don't care.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.920]   It's like saying, I don't watch Game of Thrones.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.600]   People say, well, I mean, I'm a little surprised you do seem like a nerd,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.360]   but like, I'm not mad at you.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.720]   I'm not threatening to debate you.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.320]   I'm not ambushing you on radio shows.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.880]   I'm not commissioning New York times op-eds about why aren't you using it?
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.480]   Because it's just entertainment and it's good at it for now.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.040]   And it has cultural relevance and then other things will come along.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.440]   And I think this is a very positive movement because once we have shifted
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.920]   these platforms to pure diversion, we've gotten rid of the network effect
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.680]   advantage that everyone, you know, needs to be on these platforms.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.920]   It opens the door for a lot of competition.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.160]   It opens the door for a lot of varieties and it opens the door for a lot of
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.080]   different personal preferences about how they engage with these media.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:28.400]   Seven years ago, it was incredibly difficult to be 21 and not using Facebook.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   Today, no one cares if you don't use TikTok and TikTok will come and it will go.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.800]   And there will be three other things that come in its wake.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.720]   And then there'll be 12 other things that come in those wakes.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.360]   And some people will use those services and some people will use long
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.800]   tail social media services where you pay a little bit of money and it's a niche
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.400]   crowd and it's very niche information.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.200]   And some people will ignore social media altogether and use
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.880]   podcasts and streaming services.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   And there's going to be a whole variety of different fragmented, varied
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.600]   approaches to diversion and entertainment.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   And I think that's fine.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.080]   And that's a perfectly fine use of the internet.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.280]   And once we're away from this, this expectation of universal usage,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.560]   people now have breathing room.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.120]   And they can start to say, what do I value?
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.280]   What do I want to spend my time on?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   And in digital minimalist fashion, construct lives that
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.080]   use technology in a useful way.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.600]   That was impossible to do when you would be looked at like a
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.320]   leper, if you weren't on Instagram.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.280]   It's very easy to do in a world that we're heading towards in which
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.640]   there's 17 TikTok clones and 50 other types of things that people use.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.080]   And everyone uses their own combination of things for
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   entertainment and diversion.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.160]   In that world, you can create combinations that are good for
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.320]   you without raising an eyebrow.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.200]   So yes, I don't love TikTok as a service in the sense that I'm not
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.400]   going to spend a lot of time on it.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.760]   I don't know that I would say that it is a good thing if you were
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.280]   spending hours of your day on it.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.040]   But as a indicator about where the industry is going, I think it's
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.520]   positive that it exists and is so popular because it is a death knell
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.480]   for that age of monopoly universal usage.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.280]   It is a death knell for that age where if you weren't on one of these
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.840]   three platforms, you were somehow outcast from society.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.760]   That was, as I always said, a weird temporary period.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.840]   And I am thankful that I think now we are moving out of it.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   That's my thoughts on TikTok.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.960]   Have you used it, Jesse?
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   I've never used TikTok.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.720]   Um, I have some good buddies who use it in the lacrosse world.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.800]   But see, that's, that's, what's good about this.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.720]   And like, it doesn't, it's not a surprising or weird thing that you haven't used TikTok.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.600]   Whereas this was five years ago.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.480]   If I was like, Hey, have you, uh, have you ever used Facebook?
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.320]   And you said, no, like, that'd be a weird thing.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.080]   That would be unusual thing.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.720]   Where here it's like, yeah, I have some buddies who use it and you probably
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   have a bunch of buddies who don't.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.240]   Exactly.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.360]   I think that's better.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.040]   I think that's better.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.000]   So I'm not, I'm not anti TikTok.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.320]   Again, I'm not using it myself, but.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.520]   Until you start doing your dancing video.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   Well, again, yeah, that's what we should do.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.520]   We've talked about that before.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.800]   That's that's really what's going to break open.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.920]   This channel is going to be, we lean in heavy on TikTok and, um, wait, no, I
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.360]   thought the idea was that you would be dancing aggressively in the background
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.760]   while I was delivering the information.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   Holding a lacrosse stick.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.400]   That's going to do it.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.120]   That will drive the very last, the very last listener off of our show.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   Oh my.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:22.960]   All right.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.360]   Uh, let's do a couple of sponsors here.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.480]   Pay the bills.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.520]   We got to get good sets for the TikTok video.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.320]   So we gotta kind of pay the bills here.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.000]   Um, so let's talk Headspace.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.640]   Headspace.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.480]   I am glad to have them as a sponsor.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.240]   I think it makes a lot of sense that they are a sponsor of this show.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.920]   If you haven't heard of Headspace, you probably have, but if you, if you
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.800]   haven't, uh, it is an app in which you can select from a large
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.120]   library of guided meditations.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.920]   It is what we need in our current age of uncertainty and anxiety and those
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.440]   winter gray blazes that have these guided meditations to get your head, uh, where
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   you want it to be, to get your thoughts where you want it to be.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.160]   I mean, we all say the word "fine" when people ask us how we're doing.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.040]   Say "fine."
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.400]   We never really ask, what does that mean?
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   That's not an emotion.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   For a lot of, for a lot of us, a lot of times when we say "fine," we're
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.240]   really feeling anger or stress or anxiety, or we feel completely overloaded.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.160]   That's why we need something like Headspace, which is scientifically
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.640]   proven to help you manage your feelings and mental health.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.200]   There was one recent study that recently proved that in just two weeks, Headspace
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.280]   can reduce your stress by 14%.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.920]   So whether you want to relieve stress and anxiety, sleep better, or improve
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.560]   your focus, Headspace is your everyday dose of mindfulness for real life.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.680]   Jesse, I was telling you about this earlier.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.400]   Uh, I was working with the Headspace app and found they have a whole section
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.960]   of focus-related guided meditations.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.280]   So I want to work on something hard.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.840]   I'm all over the place.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.920]   I just saw the TikTok video of Jesse dancing aggressively with a lacrosse
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.520]   stick while Cal is trying to give advice.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   And I am just distracted and devastated with the state of humanity.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.680]   And you want to get your focus.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.720]   So because I need to work on something real, you can do a guided meditation on focus.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.760]   It walks you through it and you are, you're locked in.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.960]   Gets you organized.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.560]   It was pretty cool.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.360]   Uh, they didn't ask me to do that.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.640]   They should have me, I don't know why they didn't ask
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.840]   me to narrate the focus one.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.960]   They probably will.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:29.360]   It should be like focus, focus, focus, work deeper.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.000]   Um, so no, the good news is they do not have me narrate
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.120]   the focus guided meditation.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.280]   So you can be, you can, you can be, uh, rest assured you
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280]   don't have to deal with that.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.680]   Um, so anyways, Headspace makes a lot of sense, especially in our current
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.120]   uncertain anxiety producing times.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   So however you're feeling try Headspace at headspace.com/questions and you'll
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   get one month free of their entire mindfulness library that is the

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.840]   That's headspace.com/questions.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.160]   Let's also talk Blinkist.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.960]   Blinkist was one of the first sponsors of the deep question podcast.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.880]   And for good reason, because they offer something that our
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.720]   listeners really need.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.560]   Blinkist is a subscription service that gives you these 10 to 15
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.200]   minutes summaries of some of the best and most important nonfiction
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.280]   books that are out there.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.400]   These summaries are called Blinks.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.640]   And in just 10 or 15 minutes, you get the core ideas of all of the
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.560]   biggest books currently published.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.200]   So for example, and this is from my own life, I read Yuval Harari's
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.040]   Sapiens, I like a lot of people found it really insightful.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.080]   And then he wrote Homo Deus as a follow-up.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.880]   Like a lot of people, I was like, I don't really know what that's about.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.720]   I like this guy, but I don't really understand what that's about.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   Should I read this book?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   You know how I figured that out?
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.800]   I read the Blink.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.400]   15 minutes later, like, Oh, I get what's going on here.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.200]   And I can decide, do I need to go further and read this book?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.880]   Another example I've been recommending to people is my friend, Adam Alter's
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.600]   book, Irresistible, which gets into the mechanics of how digitally
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   engineered distraction works.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.240]   This is a topic that's really relevant.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.560]   You can get the big ideas from his book in 10 or 15 minutes and
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.800]   then make the decision, ah, do I want to buy and read the whole book?
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.200]   Or as I learned what I need for now.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   And that's how I recommend using Blinkist to survey the landscape of a subject
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.120]   matter you care about, learn the main terms, learn the main ideas and
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.600]   figure out which of the books you might want to dive in deeper and read in more.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440]   Detail.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.680]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.880]   All right.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.600]   There's some ads.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.400]   Let us, uh, let's get into some calls.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.360]   How many do we have today, Jesse?
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.440]   What's our collection look like?
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.600]   We have five calls.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.160]   All right.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   I like it.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.680]   So let's, who do we got for the first one?
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.200]   The first one is Thomas and he basically has a question about deep
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.520]   life and how that applies to sales.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.040]   Nice.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.400]   All right.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.840]   Hey Cal, my name is Thomas.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.960]   First, I wanted to say thank you for all that you do.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.080]   And your work has really helped me live a better life.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.840]   Uh, anyways, I work for a software development company and I'm starting
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.520]   my own recruiting agency as well.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.480]   For both companies, my main focus is currently sales and business development.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.200]   I'm usually focused on outbound sales work, like calling, emailing,
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.840]   and curating and sharing relevant articles with prospects.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   My question is how can I incorporate deep work into my role
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.360]   and how does it apply to sales?
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.560]   Also, how do you see outbound or inbound sales, uh, for that matter, evolving
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.320]   as buyers continue to be inundated with emails and calls, thanks for taking
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.480]   the time to answer my questions.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:01.760]   Uh, well, Thomas, I mean, I think when it comes to any work activity,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.960]   probably the relevant term, and I think you're, you're mixing two similar
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.600]   terms together, but I'm going to separate them, probably the relevant
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.360]   term here is deliberate practice.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   Maybe even more so than deep work.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.040]   So deep work, and you can go back and watch my core idea video about this.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.760]   It's an activity.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.520]   It's an activity where you give something focus without distraction.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.720]   And it's a mental state in which you produce at a high level
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.440]   for your cognitive capacities.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.960]   I mean, clearly on a sales call, you know, this, you want to be doing just
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.640]   that and you don't want to be checking your email at the same time, but I
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.560]   think what's really relevant here is the related topic of deliberate practice.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.440]   It's something I write about in my book.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.160]   So good.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.600]   They can't ignore you.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.040]   How do you take this concept and apply it to the really varied and weird
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.880]   and kind of squishy to measure type activities that make up
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.400]   typical office style work?
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.640]   And my argument is we should be trying to do these efforts.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.600]   We should be trying to deliberately improve in the office.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.160]   We should be applying deliberate practice, which means we have to
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.040]   design activities specifically to stretch our ability beyond where we're
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.920]   comfortable using feedback to help keep us aimed in the right place.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.440]   And in that stretch, we get better and better.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.520]   That's probably the key thing for sales.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.480]   It's continually saying.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.400]   What are the key skills here?
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.120]   What makes a better sales call versus a worse one and designing
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.720]   activities to stretch your abilities, getting feedback to make sure that
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.120]   you're aimed in the right direction.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.720]   And this might be something you do with mentors.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   This might be something you do with studies or courses, but there's a lot
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.200]   of improvement to be done here and what really works and what does it in
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.040]   the type of sales that you do, and you should have the mindset of, I want
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.880]   to get better at this in a month than I am right now, and I'm not going to
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.480]   be better in a month just by doing a lot more calls, I'm going to get better
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.920]   by doing a lot more deliberately structured activities that stretch me
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.840]   in the places where I am not yet good, or I could be better.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.000]   So you've got to get in the information about what matters here to
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.520]   design activities, to stretch you.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.120]   That's how you get better and better.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.960]   Once you have that mindset, the issue of the mediums changing, people
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.400]   aren't listening to emails as much.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.320]   People are more inundated with distractions.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.280]   So how do we sell better?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.520]   You're going to react to that naturally because you're already going to be in
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.280]   this mindset of trying to figure out what works and stretching yourself
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.080]   towards what's better, getting back metrics, seeing what works, what doesn't,
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.360]   moving towards the things that do.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.760]   So you'll already be in that mindset.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.000]   So you'll already be shifting away from the trouble areas and towards
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.400]   the new modalities that work better.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.120]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.960]   This is a deliberate practice play.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.320]   You want to train at sales calls, like an athlete training to pick up a new
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.200]   type of shot, like an athlete, trying to get an accuracy higher.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.160]   You want to train like a chess player, trying to master a new type of opening
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.920]   deliberately structured work.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.480]   And we do this not just for success for the sake of success.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.520]   We do this because it makes you better than you were, which
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.760]   gives you more career capital.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.840]   And with that career capital, you get more flexibility and
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.400]   autonomy over your working life, which is ultimately the whole game
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.960]   here is get that capital gain control.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.720]   Your working life, move it towards what resonates in a way from what doesn't.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.000]   All that's built on skill.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.160]   The skill comes from practice.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.680]   So that is the term Thomas.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.480]   I want you to have in mind is deliberate practice, not necessarily deep work.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.600]   All right.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.120]   Who do we got next?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.360]   Jesse.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.360]   Next up we have Anthony.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.560]   He has a question.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   You've been getting a lot of these questions lately about
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.080]   seeking counter-arguments.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   Hi, Cal, Anthony here.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.120]   Thank you for your books, your articles, and this podcast.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.880]   They truly inspire me to keep living the deep life.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.560]   Keep up the great work.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:39.440]   My question is about your advice to seek out the best counter-arguments when
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.520]   developing a philosophy or stance on an issue.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.360]   I think the advice makes sense.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.240]   I was just wondering if you could provide some tips on how to actually go about
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.800]   finding the best counter-arguments and engaging with them.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.440]   What does this process look like?
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.920]   How do you go about doing it?
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.000]   Any details you could share would be helpful.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.040]   Thank you.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.120]   Well, Anthony, this question has come up a couple of times recently.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:17.120]   And the answer I gave last week in responding to a similar question was find
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.640]   someone that you know or trust or respect that is on the other side of a topic and
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.280]   then ask them, what are the great sources here?
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   Like what's the writing that inspires you?
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.360]   What's the writing that's the foundation of whatever it is you care about, right?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   So like, let's say your natural instinct is towards a sort of big
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.760]   government political theory.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.200]   You're like, I should probably understand what these libertarians are about.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.280]   So I kind of understand the opposite side of it.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.320]   Find, you know, everyone has the libertarian friend, they kind of advertise.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.200]   And be like, what's the thing you're reading, man?
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.080]   What got you into this?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.280]   Like, who do you think the big books are here, the ones that made you into this?
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.480]   And then they tell you, like, great.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:57.680]   Okay.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.880]   So these were the books they read that were quite inspiring to them.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   And then you know what to go read.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.280]   So that's what I'd recommend.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.200]   Find someone that seems reasonable on that side of the argument and ask
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.480]   them, not for their arguments, not for their particular reasons, but what
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.880]   they read that was most inspiring.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.240]   It's usually not that hard to find.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   Almost every stance and almost every position on almost every
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.560]   topic has some foundational text.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.160]   So it's all about going and finding foundational text.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.120]   Here's the added benefit of doing that, that I wasn't able to mention last time.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.800]   Put aside the particular content that you are exploring when you do this exercise.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   You are being exposed when you do this on a regular basis to foundational text.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.520]   Foundational texts in abstract are incredibly interesting and useful to
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.720]   encounter because what makes a text foundational, it means someone was
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   able to come in on some topic and deliver such a well-organized and
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.480]   persuasive structuring of the world.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   That many people changed the way they lived their lives because of it.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.680]   Those are cool books.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   I think Tyler Cowen calls these quake books.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.600]   They cause an earthquake in your, in your personal intellectual life.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.480]   Just being exposed to that type of writing, I think is exciting.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.040]   And it also really sharpens your own rhetorical skills because you're
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.120]   being exposed to the very highest level of people trying to be persuasive
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.040]   about understanding the world.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.520]   So even if you don't care about what they're saying, even if after you read
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.800]   what they're saying, it doesn't change your mind because you read a quake
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.280]   book on the other side and when they combined, you realize like that
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520]   side's probably right, you're still picking up the raw craft tools.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.880]   And it's a really interesting, fun reading experience.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.040]   And it infuses in you the power of nonfiction done right.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.560]   So that is a hidden benefit I wanted to point out here is that not only do you
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.800]   enrich in your own understanding of a topic by reading the best stuff on the
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.280]   other side, not only does that give you more authenticity, not only does that
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.560]   give you more deeper roots of understanding, not only does that give
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.480]   you the confidence to take actual action.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.400]   It also exposes you to a really cool genre of writing, those types of books
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.000]   that can change the way that people live.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.120]   And I got to say, I just have to, I continue to double down on this idea
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.200]   that it is not wrong to expose yourself to people that you worry you disagree with.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:18.480]   Be very, very wary of anyone who says, I don't want you being exposed
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.280]   to that because you might be tricked.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.080]   I won't be, I'm smart, I'm sophisticated, but you might be tricked
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.320]   into believing the wrong thing.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.200]   So I don't want you to listen to that.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.080]   And in fact, we should probably make that thing go away because people
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.280]   might hear that and be tricked.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.160]   We need to be very careful about what you hear.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.680]   That is always the character you don't want to be in the Orwell novel.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.600]   That's always the character in the Huxley book that you're saying like,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.000]   ooh, that's not the guy I like.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.320]   All right.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.000]   So just be very wary of that.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.800]   I can think of no better way to build convictions than to expose those
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.160]   convictions to good arguments that disagree.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   It's going to nuance and sophisticate your, your understanding.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.360]   And as I talked about last week, it means you're going to take more
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.640]   action, more action in the service of things you care about if you're exposed
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.080]   to the countervailing arguments, because you get more confidence in your stance.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.160]   You get more nuance.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.600]   You're not just online firing emojis at people.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.520]   You actually say I get this and feel strong about this.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.800]   And I have a sophisticated dialectically formed vision on this.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.840]   So why don't we actually get out there and make some change?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.440]   So a lot of great things come out of that strategy, Anthony.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.200]   So seek out those books, read those books and you will be well off.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.400]   All right.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.920]   Moving right along here, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.880]   All right.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.760]   Next up, we have a question from Joe and he's got a, he talks about little bets,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.560]   a concept that you introduced in your book.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.320]   Uh, so good.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.040]   They can't ignore you.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.240]   Hi Cal, this is Joe from the Midwest.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.360]   I wanted to thank you for answering my previous questions, especially the one
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.440]   about, um, getting, recognizing that we're going through a year of a dumpster fire
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.960]   and to spend the summer really chiseling away at the deep work and get a Marine
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.040]   stove while I do it.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.840]   Um, didn't get the Marine stove, but I did spend a summer working on the big
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.160]   project and it was, it helps keeps me, keep me sane.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.480]   Um, my question is about little bets.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.800]   You mentioned it so good.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.680]   They can't ignore you that you allot time to pursue little bets and you test them
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.480]   out on your blog as short little blog posts, or you test them out in different
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.120]   ways.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.600]   I'm wondering.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.120]   As, as you get deeper into your career, do you still allot a significant amount
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.520]   of time for these little bets?
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.640]   For me, I'm very fortunate that I got my first book deal.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   I'm working really hard on that project and a couple of other really big rocks
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.360]   for my career, but I don't really see short of Athena bursting out of my skull,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   how I can allot specific time just to pursue little bets when these other
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   looming deadlines and big projects need my attention now.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.640]   So if you could spend some time talking about what role does little bets take as
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.600]   you get deeper into your career, I think it would really help.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.320]   Thanks.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.680]   Well, Joe, congratulations on the book deal.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:14.880]   Uh, shame, however, for not buying a Marine pellet stove is that is critical.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.760]   That is critical to any deep work shed space for people who don't remember this
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.240]   question.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.200]   Uh, it was Michael Pollan when Michael Pollan built a writer shed in the woods
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.320]   behind his house in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.880]   He heated it with a Marine pellet stove.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.440]   So it's, it's a, like a pellet burning stove you put on a boat.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.400]   So it generates heat, but it's like small, you know, because it's
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.440]   main just for heating a boat.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.840]   And so you put a pellet Marine pellet stove in your teeny house and that's
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.320]   how you heat it while you look out over the snow strewn fields and the snow
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.360]   laden boughs of the birch trees and Kent, Connecticut, and have that warmth
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.160]   as you write in your, your, uh, cabin wood line cabin, that's the vision.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.520]   So yeah, you still need to buy that stove.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.440]   I actually went, uh, I went out to Kent, Connecticut a few years ago and was
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.720]   doing a speaking gig out there.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.280]   And, and it was like at a conference, like one of these conferences they used
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.720]   to do for, uh, rich people basically.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.560]   And the rich people come and then a bunch of speakers and writers
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.640]   come and give talks and stuff.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.840]   And, and the speakers and writers come because they want to meet
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.920]   the other speakers and writers.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.800]   And then the, uh, the rich people come because they want to, you know,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.440]   hear from the speakers and writers.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's kind of a weird thing, but kind of a cool thing.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.680]   And it was in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.200]   So Michael Pollan was there because he still kept that house in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.520]   And, uh, who else was there?
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.680]   Henry Kissinger was there.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.080]   Cause he turns out to have a house in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.640]   He's very old now, but he was there as well.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.400]   Um, but that was interesting.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.320]   So that's when I learned like, oh, Paul and has the house here.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.120]   And I can tell you, it's like a beautiful town.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.120]   It has like this kind of fancy main street and then it's all hills and trees.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.200]   And I get why people flee New York to move to Kent.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.080]   And so that's my, that's my Kent, Connecticut story.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.560]   Um, all right, but let's get back to Little Bets.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.240]   So Little Bets was a concept I talked about.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.640]   And so good.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.360]   They can't ignore you.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.000]   It was coined by, I believe the author's name was Sims.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.160]   Maybe Phil Sims.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.800]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.880]   Do you have it, Jesse?
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.720]   You could look it up, right?
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.560]   Well, Phil Sims is definitely a NFL quarterback.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.400]   So I was saying, well, he's an NFL quarterback who also writes about
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.960]   business strategy in his book, Little Bets.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   Is that all right.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.360]   So probably not Phil Sims.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.080]   Can you, can you do like a Joe Rogan, Jamie thing here and see if we can find out?
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   No, I feel bad.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.280]   I feel bad that I'm using the.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.240]   The wrong name.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.880]   Anyways, I think the guy's name was Sims.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.440]   I mean, I, this is a decade ago I wrote this book.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:45.040]   Uh, but it was a, uh, a self-explanatory concept of in your career, in your
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:51.600]   business, what you want to try to do is take steps for which you can get feedback.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.000]   And then you can see, and that can direct it.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.720]   Oh, I get feedback.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.680]   Like this isn't resonating.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.760]   This is, let me go that direction.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   Let me try a couple more bets.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:05.080]   And by making a sequential bets and making your future actions based on
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.680]   the feedback from those bets, you can actually have like an evidence-based
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.400]   way of guiding what you do.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.560]   And this is better than he would argue.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.760]   Uh, coming up with a huge, big plan in abstract and then like, I'm gonna go
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.600]   execute this three-year plan, you know, and I hope it goes well.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.680]   So Sims was saying, take bets and get feedback.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.600]   John Sims.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.840]   Is it John Sims?
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.560]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.120]   Can you find, can you find the book little bets on?
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.280]   I'll look for it.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.880]   Like Amazon or something like that.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.080]   If it is Phil Sims, that'd be awesome.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.120]   If the, if the quarterback, if the quarterback was writing that book.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.040]   Phil Sims is on Mad Dog every Friday.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:42.840]   I love that spot.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.000]   Okay.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.920]   So Phil Sims is on Mad Dog every Friday talking like Harvard business
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.240]   review style, career strategy.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.800]   Like Mad Dog, let me talk to you about getting feedback from the right market
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.880]   segments on your consulting firm.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.160]   Um, so Joe, I mean, I think the key thing to take away from little bets is.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.560]   Peter Sims.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.680]   Peter Sims.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.840]   I was close.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.040]   Phil Peter.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.120]   Peter Sims, little known fact, younger brother of NFL quarterback.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.760]   I'm just going to, I'm just going to put that out there.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.720]   It's good to clear that.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.800]   Um, so the feedback's what's key.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.480]   So Joe, the feedback's what's key.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:21.880]   Right.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.560]   And so I'm thinking about your situation.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.520]   At some point you're, as you get feedback and you move along, you get to the
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.880]   place where the steps are pretty big.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.160]   But if you're thinking about a book, you're writing a book now, but how
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.280]   did you come to write that book?
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.440]   Hopefully there was a sequence of little bets where you were finding, uh, these
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.240]   ideas, what resonates, what seems to have an audience.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.320]   And so you have this clear feedback before you actually go to the
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.680]   stage of writing a book about it.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.840]   I think that's a clear example.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.040]   I mean, take something like my most recent book, a world without email.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.320]   How many years can you go back and hear me talking about these things?
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.920]   I mean, you can go back and like my first appearance on the
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.240]   Ezra Klein podcast years ago.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   I'm working through a bunch of the core ideas that became a world without email.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.200]   Right.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.440]   Years before how many articles that I write, there's actually an article I wrote
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.160]   for the Harvard business review to promote deep work, so all the way back
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:19.280]   in 2016, that was about getting rid of email and working through some concepts
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.320]   that made their way into the book.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.760]   So I, years of why workout concepts and my little bets are I write about them
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.800]   or I talk about them on this podcast, or I talk about them on other podcasts,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.320]   or I write articles about them and I see what the response is.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.400]   So like, I'm thinking now I might write a book about slow productivity.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   I've been testing out this, this idea.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.480]   I wrote a New Yorker piece about it.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.240]   Got some pretty good feedback that was useful.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.200]   I did a podcast video about this, a core idea video that was useful.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.840]   I talked about on Tim Ferriss's podcast and I could see when he split up
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.800]   that interview into segments, he did a clip of the slow productivity discussion.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.680]   And that's the most viewed clip of all the clips he did from the, the podcast.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.400]   That's feedback on this.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.280]   So there's a little bets that are helping me put together what I want to do.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.720]   And at some point I'm going to write a book about it.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.640]   So Joe, I would say that's the takeaway message is you want to get real feedback
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   from people, not people like friends, but actual unbiased feedback.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   Are you buying this?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.000]   Are you paying for this?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.480]   Are you giving me money and allow that to help direct you
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.600]   towards which direction you go.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.160]   But I think you're absolutely right to point out that a little bet strategy.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.520]   We'll eventually lead you to really big things to take time.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.120]   You do a lot of bets on, on topics.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.720]   You might then spend, end up spending two years writing a book, do a little
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.200]   bunch of little bets on a product.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.600]   You might end up at some point taking on investment and going all in on a business.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.680]   And that's a multi-year commitment one way or the other.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.280]   So that's true.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.400]   Little bets lead to big commitments, but the key is not to jump right
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.000]   into that big commitment just because you hope, or you have a reasonable
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.240]   story about why, what you're going to do would be useful that you
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.120]   actually have some evidence.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.480]   And if you doubt that talk to NFL quarterback, Phil Sims, he will fill your
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.320]   ear, you will fill your ear with thoughts on, on little bets.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.080]   All right.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.680]   That's a blast for the past.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.080]   So good.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.240]   They can't ignore you as 2012.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.400]   So yeah, we're at the 10 year, 10 year anniversary.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.840]   Interesting.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.520]   Like that's when I kick off.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.800]   That's when I kicked off my writing career as a nonfiction idea book writer.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.680]   I wrote these three books for students.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.400]   That's how I got my sea legs.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   That's how I built up my craft.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:24.960]   And so good.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.640]   They can't ignore you was the vision I had all along.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   And I want to write idea books, nonfiction books, table at Barnes and
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.880]   Noble on NPR, you know, New York times articles, like that's what I wanted to do.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.000]   And that's where I kicked off that transition.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.880]   So it's like a really important book for me.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.000]   It was the first time someone said, okay, you're, you're allowed to write
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.240]   a hardcover book about an idea.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.800]   It's a crazy thing.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   Like just an idea you made up, you know, and we're going to, you can just put that
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.560]   in a book and we'll, we'll see what happens.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.800]   So that was definitely a big, big transition for me.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   That's a cool story.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.840]   Um, and it was good.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.000]   That book went to auction.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.840]   And at the time it seemed like a lot of money.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.560]   It's how we bought our first, you know, it was the down payment for our first
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.320]   house and how we bought our first car.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.520]   As we came out to Georgetown was because that book was really, I wrote
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.640]   it right before I came out here and it came out like right after I got here.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.760]   It's my memory.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.720]   My memory is right after I got to Georgetown, it came out, but
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.960]   I wrote it as a postdoc.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.040]   And so it was exciting.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.440]   Like it was some money and not like life changing money, but like bigger, bigger
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.360]   by far, like factor of five bigger than I was getting for the student books or
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.960]   whatever, and then it didn't do well out of the gates, right?
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.040]   So there's a story in that, like we, we, uh, there's a big push.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:48.440]   We, we hired a good PR company and, um, you know, it just kind of disappeared.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.200]   We're like, oh man, I guess, you know, I didn't know how publicity,
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.440]   I had no idea how book sales work.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.680]   I don't, I still don't know how that works.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.860]   And it's like, okay, I guess, uh, do I get to keep doing this?
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.360]   I don't know.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.800]   And so I pitched them deep work finally into like, yeah, but
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.760]   we're going to pay you less money.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   But if you want to write it, go ahead, you know, and it was just a funny thing.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.520]   It's just, uh, good ideas are good ideas and it took years, but then it just.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:14.000]   It picked up and, uh, sold hundreds of thousands of copies, but like it was,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.560]   uh, it seemed like a dud out of the gate.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.640]   And I'll say the two things that seemed to matter was podcasting came along
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.040]   about two years after I wrote that book.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.680]   So I wrote that book.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.640]   I did a thing for the New York times and like, uh, got a good, you know,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.380]   there's a few things I did and kind of disappeared and it's some
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.620]   radio, but some stupid radio.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.600]   Uh, and then starting around 2014, podcasting became a thing.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.360]   And so I became, I was like a very early guest in podcasting circuits,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.900]   doing a lot of these early podcasts.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.320]   And, and I just did a lot of podcasts.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.880]   Like, why not?
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.680]   I thought it was fun.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.560]   And, um, I think that built the slow burn.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.320]   If there's like 2014 to 2016, I was on a lot of shows and that's
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.740]   how I got kind of good at it because I was doing podcasting really early on.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.180]   And I sort of learned a medium and I think that's what really two years
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.640]   after it came out, started that burn.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.780]   And then deep work did something similar, but it's burn was much more intense.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.180]   Like that, that book sold a lot of copies.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.580]   And I think that also just pointed people back towards that original book.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.980]   So that's how it all got started for me.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.260]   I was, got real excited.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.180]   I got this deal, got this book.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.100]   It disappeared.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.900]   Thought that I'd be done with publishing and then podcasting came
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.140]   along and deep work came along.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.260]   And that's actually like a, it turned out to be a very successful book.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.220]   The other thing too, that you talk about and others talk about is you have.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.020]   You had another job too, so you weren't relying on that to survive.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.700]   So, I mean, you could like give it some time.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.100]   I don't, it would have been harder if I was, well, what happened
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.660]   in the nonfiction space, and you have to become like a super speaker.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.580]   That's what was happening back then.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.520]   If you're trying to make a living off of nonfiction advice books, you had to be
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:50.660]   doing 30 to 50 speeches a year, you know, and like what a lot of writers would do
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.740]   in that space, and it's, it's very lucrative by the way, but it's, it's
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.500]   tough, but a lot of writers would just do year on year off.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.300]   So like 50 speeches, killer.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.740]   And then a year writing, then 50 speeches a year writing, and you always
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.820]   had to have the book came out and then your whole, then your, your whole
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.900]   life is built around the speaking.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.900]   So fortunately I was a professor and so I didn't have to do that.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.740]   You know, I could just say, I don't know, I guess this book didn't do well.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.500]   And I waited a long time.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.420]   That book came out in 2012 and then I didn't deep work came out four years later.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.740]   So I was having kids and trying to get tenure, you know, and so
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.900]   that was kind of a fun time, actually.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.940]   I mean, there's something innocent to it.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.300]   I would do, it was entirely homegrown.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.980]   This is the way I remember it is like I would do podcast, uh, in my basement.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.980]   And that was it.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.940]   And then at some point I started writing deep work, just sort of on my own.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.020]   And that was it.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.340]   Right.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.060]   And then everything else was just organic.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   And so that's my view.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.620]   If like, if, if a book is right, it will eventually sell a lot of copies.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.380]   Um, regardless of what happens early on.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.060]   I, I don't know how to make a book, sell a lot of copies right up front.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.900]   I've never been able to do that.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.220]   It's kind of like what the book says.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.060]   It's so good.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.660]   You can't ignore you.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.100]   So like the book is good.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.260]   They can't be ignored.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.380]   I don't think anyone knows.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.940]   Like my editor, I love the editor on that book.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.020]   He's like, this is a great idea.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.340]   Like this.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.140]   And he was right in the end, we sold a ton of copies of that book.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.260]   And he, but he was like baffled.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.940]   He's like, why aren't we early on?
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.020]   Why isn't, why is no one buying this?
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.780]   It's such, I just don't think people understand or they don't understand
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.220]   the degree to which like email lists, these other types of dynamics and
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.100]   cultural, your cultural awareness.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.700]   Like this stuff plays a huge role in things like taking off right out of the back.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.780]   Um, but it's almost like that's orthogonal from whether or not the book is going to be.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.180]   So we'll see.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:29.980]   We'll see.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.900]   But it was a cool story.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.340]   So that, that started that whole chapter of my life, which was,
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.220]   that was an interesting one.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.260]   All right.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:37.780]   What do we got here?
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.580]   Who's our next question?
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:43.300]   Next question's from Greg and it's about information overload.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.380]   Hi Cal.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.700]   I struggle with information overload.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.420]   Basically.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.540]   I think I read too much.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.420]   All the amazing articles, books, papers, newsletters, and blogs that are available
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:57.100]   by the thousands, no matter how narrow a person's interest is.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.100]   I mean, I'm interested in programming Haskell and just for that, I have a dozen
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.180]   papers, three books, and about 50 bookmarks.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.820]   Even if I try to drive my reading backwards from goals and have a philosophy of just
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.140]   in time, not just in case there are other reasons to read widely, like the
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:19.820]   responsibility of being a good citizen, the steward of family wealth, or even
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.980]   being the head of the household.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.860]   This all means keeping up is important.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.100]   And that involves a lot of general reading.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.660]   Have you thought about this much?
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:30.340]   It seems like FOMO, but is less frivolous.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.300]   Thank you.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.700]   Yeah, Greg, it's a good point.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:40.660]   Um, it sounds like you are, you probably are reading too much, but more
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.660]   importantly, you're probably putting too much pressure on yourself about all
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.580]   these different things that you need to master.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.260]   And so I'll give you a couple of practical suggestions for structuring
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.460]   what I think is like a reasonable, aggressive, but reasonable life of reading.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:02.740]   So you have your books and you want to read a fair number of books each month.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.300]   That's fine.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.420]   So you have some sort of goal like that.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.060]   I read five, whatever you want your goal to be.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.780]   Don't care too much about what they are diverse, diverse, different, uh, types
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.180]   of books, different genres, examples.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:18.140]   You're kind of keeping that intellectual life going when it comes to mastering a
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.660]   topic, so you have a personality type, which is common, but not everyone has it.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.620]   Where you really like mastering a topic, reading a lot about a topic and mastering
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.620]   it, I think that's fine.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.060]   And you want to lean into that, but do it sequentially, sequentially.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.420]   It's a hard word.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.820]   So what's the thing I'm trying to master now?
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.140]   Okay.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.780]   I'm doing Haskell now, or there's a personal finance thing I'm going to
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.420]   obsess about now, or I want to learn about, you know, whatever, some
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.860]   new hobby or, or something like that.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.420]   I think that's fine, but just do it one at a time.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.980]   Like here's my obsession of the moment.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.300]   And if that's your personality type, it's fine to have an obsession,
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.620]   but just do one at a time and maybe have a nice place for actually
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   keeping notes on that.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.020]   If you want, you can use some sort of system where you, you type up a lot
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.100]   of notes and keep track of them and do your research that you're not losing
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.420]   that information and that's fine.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.340]   But you just do one of those things at a time.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.420]   So you don't feel this pressure if I have to keep up with everything.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.100]   So now, so we have books.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.660]   I want to keep reading books, wide variety.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.540]   You're a singular obsession.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.940]   Only one at a time.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.460]   Now that obsession might include books that will influence what some of your
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.020]   books are, but don't let your obsession take over your monthly book quota.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.700]   The final thing to add in there is serendipitous, entertaining,
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.940]   or shorter form reading.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.860]   So you have newsletters and magazines and there's these types of things.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.460]   And you find some benefit to this.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:35.380]   I, I, you know, a Cal Newport article that I get might get me thinking about
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.700]   this and maybe I subscribe to like Ben Thompson's strategy and that gives me
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.580]   some like interesting insight into the world of, of, of, uh, business.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.420]   And maybe like you subscribe to the New Yorker and there's like a.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.940]   YouTube channel of someone you like to watch, but it's more funny.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.380]   Like you have all this type of stuff too.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.340]   So what do we do with that?
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.380]   And I would say for that third category, work backwards from time slots.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:03.460]   So you see that all as programming, like on a TV channel, like HBO or something,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.020]   and you put aside time you watch HBO.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.460]   Like, okay, it's Saturday mornings and I like to take a long lunch break on
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.420]   Fridays, right in my day, early on Fridays or whatever, like you have it figured out.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.260]   There's certain times where I just want to expose myself.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.020]   I don't want to overthink it to the interesting, the random, the
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.180]   serendipitous, the funny, all what the internet has to offer.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.100]   And maybe this is where social media comes into play too.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.740]   I just, this platform I like to go on.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.500]   I follow these people.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.620]   I want to see what they're up to set the times.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.260]   And then work backwards to what am I drawing from in those times?
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.340]   So when I'm out of time, I'm out of time.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.740]   So that leads to a natural curation.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.420]   Like, okay, well, I don't usually pull from these four podcasts.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.100]   I'm going to stop, you know, listening to those.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.900]   And these email newsletters I don't read, but I usually like
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.060]   this guy's email newsletter.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.380]   So I'll keep subscribed to this guy.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.460]   I'm not going to subscribe to those.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.740]   You can use tools like Flipboard, et cetera.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.980]   There's a lot of tools like this where you go to Instapaper, where you can kind
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.340]   of pull information from the web and various places into like a clean, easy
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.460]   format, you can put on your tablet and bring that tablet to the coffee shop.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.660]   And that's where you sit and read.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.700]   I'm a big fan of that.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.980]   So pull it out of context, but you have a set amount of time and
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.540]   that puts back a natural curation.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.180]   For someone like you, Greg, that's interested in information, likes
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.460]   information, likes having obsessions, like understanding things.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.060]   That's my three prong suggestion.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.300]   Have a fixed number of books you read, have an obsession, but you
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.060]   only do one obsession at a time.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.820]   And for the serendipitous, random and funny, have set times you do that.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.180]   And if it doesn't fit in that time, you don't get to it.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.020]   And that will naturally curate what you actually pull from.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.660]   Do those things.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.020]   I think you have, you're keeping up with your responsibilities.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.100]   You're keeping life interesting.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.180]   You're going to be exposed to a lot of interesting things, but you're
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.420]   not going to have that stress of, I can't keep up with everything.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.580]   And you're not going to have the accidental side effect of, let's say
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.260]   the frivolous or serendipitous takes over all your time from, you know, the
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.740]   deeper book you wanted to read or the obsession gets in the way of
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.020]   anything interesting in your life.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.260]   This gives you a nice balance.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.860]   All right.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.660]   So thanks for that, Greg.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.060]   Now we do have one more question, but we want to take a quick break
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.540]   before we get there to hear a word from our sponsors.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:15.460]   In particular, I want to talk about Monk Pack Keto Nut and Seed Bars.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:16.780]   All right.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:22.220]   So these are a granola bar style snack, except for unlike the junk you would
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.700]   find in those normal types of granola bars, the Monk Pack Keto Nut and Seed
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.300]   Bars have one gram of sugar or less, two to three grams of net carbs, and
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.820]   they're only 150 calories.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.100]   So the keto is in the name because if you're following a keto lifestyle,
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.780]   they're perfect for that, but you don't have to be following a keto lifestyle
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:46.580]   to get a lot of value out of something that tastes so good and yet is so good.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.540]   For you.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.300]   They have that perfect balance of sweet and salty, a crunch from the
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.740]   whole nuts and seeds, but still managed to be soft and chewy.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.100]   The soft is really important to me.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.700]   I don't like the fully hard granola bars and these are soft,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.820]   but they have those seeds on them.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.460]   A lot of great flavors, caramel, sea salt, peanut butter, dark
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.980]   chocolate, my favorite is sea salt, dark chocolate, like there's
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.420]   a layer of dark chocolate on it.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.500]   Here's why I eat those.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.020]   There'll be these times where I'm exhausted.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.580]   I've been working a long day, time blocking, time blocking.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.420]   Don't have a lot of time.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.620]   I'm hungry and tired, so I'm not going to go make a salad or something like that,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.780]   but I don't want to eat junk.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:28.420]   I can grab one of these Monk Pack bars and it feels like a treat.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:33.700]   It feels like a special occasion, but they're not filling me with sugar.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.780]   They're not going to crash me five hours later or five minutes later.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.620]   I should say they're also gluten-free plant-based non-GMO, no soy, no
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.620]   trans fat, sugar, alcohols, or artificial colors, so it is a
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.740]   snack that gets the job done.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.340]   So try it for yourself and you'll see, we have a special deal for our listeners.

[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:32.220]   Speaking of delicious, nutritious food, I also want to talk about Just Egg.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.580]   Now I am a egg eater.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.180]   You know this about me.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.740]   I eat eggs almost every day.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.740]   Feels like a lot of eggs.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.380]   I like them, but it feels like a lot of eggs to be eating, which is why I was so
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.980]   excited to hear about this next sponsor.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:52.300]   Just Egg is a cholesterol-free plant-based egg that will give you the
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.420]   most decadent quiches of your life, the fluffiest scrambles, and the
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.060]   easiest egg sandwiches of all times.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.620]   It has the same protein as a chicken egg and less saturated fat.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:07.300]   Plus Just Egg is packed with cholesterol-lowering polyunsaturated fats.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.100]   Chicken eggs wish they were this healthy.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.260]   And because Just Egg comes from plants, you're also helping to save the planet.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.180]   So in my life, it allows me to still feel like I'm having eggs every day, but I can
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.300]   throw the Just Egg into my rotation and have a nice cholesterol-lowering
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.380]   plant-based alternative on some days.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.860]   I think this is a great idea for a product.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.220]   So if like me, you like the idea of eggs, but you don't like the idea of
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:41.860]   eating chicken eggs all the time, check out Just Egg, you will enjoy it.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.580]   All right, Jesse, that's what we got for sponsors.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.780]   I think we have time for one more caller.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.300]   Who do we have here for our final caller?
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.460]   All right, final call.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.380]   We have Walker.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.620]   It's basically about your tagline, do better, do less, know why.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.340]   And he's also has a question about the journey of his medical student career.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:00.700]   Okay.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.620]   Hi, Cal.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.420]   My name's Walker and I've actually had the privilege of you answering a few of
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.060]   my questions on the podcast before.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.660]   They were extremely helpful.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.340]   So thanks for that.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:19.260]   My questions today arise as a bit of a related set of questions to that.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:29.780]   Namely that philosophically, how do you square the maximum of doing better, doing
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.700]   less, and knowing why with the journey of a premedical student?
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:41.060]   I ask this because if you ask any premed students, traditional or not, they can
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:47.300]   attest to the slew of expectations proposed by admissions committees, advisors, et
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.140]   cetera, that require you to excel in the classroom and work, research, clinical
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:56.020]   and non-clinical volunteering, and perhaps curing cancer and winning an
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.260]   Olympic gold medal on the side.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.100]   How does that square with your maximum?
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.380]   Is it a contradiction?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.740]   Does it hold up as an exception to the rule?
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.780]   Curious to your thoughts on this.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.980]   And then specifically, how might you advise someone in my situation working
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:18.100]   full-time and trying to fit in all of these goals and accomplish them and achieve them?
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:18.940]   Thanks.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.340]   Well, Walker, it's a good question.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.580]   We're talking about admissions here.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:30.940]   We're talking about academic admissions and how that fits with the old motto of my
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.020]   website, and I would say sort of the new motto of the deep life writ large, which
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.620]   is to do less, do better, know why.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.220]   Two points about pre-med.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:44.660]   Number one, in the vast majority of cases, the thing that is vastly most
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.180]   important is your grades and MCATs.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.220]   So get good grades, get good MCATs.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.900]   That's what's going to matter for almost any medical school, especially for you.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.860]   You're working full-time and you want to go back to med school.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.340]   That's basically what you have, the knobs you have to turn.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.300]   You have your grades, those are probably already set.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.580]   You want to get good MCAT scores and you get good MCAT scores by practicing on
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.580]   actual tests, deliberately improving your skills until you can get the score
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.900]   you want under time conditions.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.420]   There's no shortcut for actually practice, get better, practice, get
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   better until you can consistently hit the score you want.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.860]   So that's probably what you need to do.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.980]   Does that take a small number of med schools off the table?
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:23.540]   Probably.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:28.460]   There are a small number of med schools where there is such selective admissions
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.620]   that everyone might be, you could fill a whole class with people who have
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.580]   pegged their grades and MCATs.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.340]   So they have to use other factors to differentiate.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.180]   Well, that's probably not going to be the med school where you're going to go.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.700]   That's fine.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:43.860]   Go to a good med school, pick up the skills, create a good career as a doctor.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.700]   Now let's, let's step back and say you're in a situation where you want to try to
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.580]   get into one of those top med schools and you think stuff beyond just your
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.900]   grades and MCATs are going to matter.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.020]   Well, I wrote a whole book about this for college admissions, but the same ideas
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.820]   apply to let's say medical school admissions.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:03.860]   That book was called How to Become a High School Superstar or How to
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   Be a High School Superstar.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.980]   I forgot which verb it was.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.620]   And it got into what makes people impressive.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.860]   And it was looking at it from the standpoint of college admissions.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.260]   But again, I think this is similar to these types of highly
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.460]   competitive med school admissions.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.500]   And it said, again, put aside grades and test scores are 99% of the battle.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.380]   So that's destiny, but beyond that, what can you do?
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.660]   And the answer came down to guess what?
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.540]   Do less, do better, know why.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:33.780]   This idea, we write these storylines that somehow the quantity of things we do is
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.940]   impressive because, wow, it's so hard to do a lot of things, but that does not
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.460]   correctly characterize how we assess impressiveness, you're going to be
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:45.660]   assessed more on the thing you do best and how interesting or unexplainable it is.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.020]   Do less things, do the things you do at a really high level and have a really
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.460]   good reason for doing it is what's going to play, that's what's going to impress
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.220]   people, not that I did seven different things.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:00.220]   And so there's a lot of ideas in that book about how to do this.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.420]   At first of all, it tells you to become interesting.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.260]   You have to be an actual interesting person, which means you probably have to
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.780]   do less because you need time to read and explore and go to talks and have thoughts
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:12.260]   and develop interests that are non-artificial and that's hard for a lot
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.180]   of people, but doing less is the foundation for becoming more interesting,
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.300]   which allows you to get some attention.
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.620]   When it comes time to do better, the book talks about when you have an interest,
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.540]   you follow that particular interest to interesting places and you can't plan it
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.940]   all out in advance, but you do it really well, that opens up opportunities.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.020]   You take one of those opportunities that you do that really well, that opens up new
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.700]   opportunities and what you really want to try to do according to that book is trigger
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:40.540]   what is called the failed simulation effect, eventually get to a place where people say,
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.180]   I can't even understand how Walker did this.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.740]   Like I wouldn't even know how to go about doing that.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.620]   And that triggers a much more bigger burst of impressiveness than instead
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.540]   trying to go into a direction with an incredibly well-defined competitive
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:59.020]   instructor structure, like being an athlete and saying, okay, my goal is to be a win
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.620]   that structure and be an Olympic athlete.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.540]   One person succeeds at that.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.100]   So good luck.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.660]   It's much better to go this failed simulation route where instead you say,
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:12.060]   yeah, you know, I wrote a book and like have a, this podcast and wrote a book.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.100]   Like, I don't even know how a young guy writes a book.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.020]   That's really impressive.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.100]   Even if it was actually in terms of net effort, way easier
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.220]   than becoming an Olympic athlete.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.700]   So that book gets into a lot of these type of, a lot of these type of ideas.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:28.420]   So don't just assume, you know, really what makes people impressive
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.580]   beyond their test scores and grades in these contexts.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.300]   Usually people construct these stories as a self-defense mechanism.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.900]   I mean, Walker, what you were saying there, the way you listed what you
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.500]   have to do to med school, to me just felt a little bit like self-defense.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.580]   Let me just list things I know, like it would be implausible for me to do.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.660]   So there's some protection there.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.740]   Impressiveness is a squirrelly subject, my friend.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:53.140]   That's not as cut and dry as in clearly defined competitive
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.140]   structures, how high are you?
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.060]   Or in terms of sheer difficulty of number of things you did, how
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.580]   many did you do and there's room there for creativity and unusual and
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.780]   uniqueness, and that's the path that most people need to go to get your
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.900]   grades and test scores that'll determine your score.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.740]   If you're one of the few number of people where you actually have to add
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.300]   activities, it's better to be an interesting person who did less, but
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.780]   did the things they did really well and took them to interesting places.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.340]   It's a more interesting life and it's more refreshing and interesting
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.700]   to those admissions officers.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.700]   So a lot of thoughts to say about those types of admission processes, but we
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.900]   have a lot of learning to do on it.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.580]   So that book is a good place to start.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.060]   But for you Walker, if you're working full time, don't worry about it.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.100]   Get your MCAT scores.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.380]   Good.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.260]   Go to a good school.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.260]   Try not to take on too much debt.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.100]   You know, do very well in that med school.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.540]   So you get matched into a good residency.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.540]   Good things will happen from there.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.460]   But from here, we are out of time.
