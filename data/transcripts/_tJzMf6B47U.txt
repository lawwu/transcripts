[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.080]   found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter and the sixth
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.320]   verse. The sixth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.660]   Ephesians. "To the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.960]   accepted in the Beloved." Again to remind ourselves of the setting let me read
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.460]   from verse 3. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.360]   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.800]   as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.800]   adoption of children or sons by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.200]   pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.800]   made us accepted in the Beloved." We have reminded ourselves that in these
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.880]   verses the Apostle displays before us particularly that part of the work of
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.720]   our salvation which we attribute to God the Father. In this great first chapter
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.480]   of this epistle he is dealing with this great theme of redemption and he shows
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.280]   us clearly how the three persons in the Blessed Holy Trinity have taken part in
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   this work. And here from verse 4 to 6 he emphasizes especially the work of the
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.520]   Father. Then from verse 7 to 12 it will be the work of the Son and then in verses
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.840]   13 and 14 the work of the Holy Spirit. And he has told us and we've already
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.720]   considered what the Father has done. He tells us here that he has called us and
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.400]   chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   blame before him in love. But not only that, higher still. He has called us,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.640]   predestinated us, to be his children. He's adopted us as his sons according to the
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.320]   good pleasure of his will. And now here in this sixth verse he takes us still a
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   further step. God, he tells us, has done all this to us and for us according to
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   the good pleasure of his own will. He has been moved to do all this by nothing in
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:49.000]   us whatsoever. It is entirely himself. Salvation is not God's response to men's
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.720]   desire or to men's request. Man in sin doesn't desire salvation. He's never made
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.680]   a request for it. He is an enemy to God and an alien in his mind. He is dead in
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   trespasses and sins. Christian salvation, I say, is not God's response to anything
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   in men. It is entirely from God. He was moved, I say, by nothing in that great
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   eternal council before the very foundation of the world, saved by his own
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.640]   glory and his own nature, his own grace and love and mercy and compassion. Now
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.120]   the Apostle has been emphasizing all that. But there must have been some
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.920]   reason why God did this. We say that with reverence. There must have been something
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.280]   that led and impelled God to plan and to purpose the salvation of men and women
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.800]   who believe in Christ. What was that? Well, the answer to that, it seems to me, is
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.160]   given to us in this sixth verse that we are looking at together this morning.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   Here is the great motive, if you like, behind redemption. This is the ultimate
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.160]   purpose in the mind and in the wisdom of God that has led to everything that we
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.640]   read of as the carrying out of this great purpose of salvation in the pages
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.520]   of the Bible. The ultimate objective, the motive of it all, is this—to the praise
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   of the glory of his grace. It is all, I say, for the glory of God. And that is the
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   thing that the Apostle opens before us in this particular verse. But the
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.360]   astonishing thing, indeed the almost incredible thing, is this—that God has
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:02.200]   purposed to do all that in us and through us. Because here, the whole time
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.440]   he is really dealing with us, we have been chosen to be holy. We have been
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.280]   chosen to the adoption of sons, yes, and we have been chosen that we might be to
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.000]   the praise of the glory of his grace. So this is still a further step in the
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.080]   wonderful things that God has done and is doing for us as a part of this great
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.180]   process of redemption. You notice that all these statements are all connected
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.800]   together. There is no full stop here at all. Each one goes on to something else.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.920]   And this verse starts with "to the praise," to the intent, or with the objective, or
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.040]   with the object of, that we should be to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.960]   Therefore you see that here we are still looking at something that God has done
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.160]   for us and gives to us in this great redemption. And in this same statement
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.880]   the Apostle also tells us how we should regard ourselves in the light of all
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.480]   this, what our reaction should be to all this. In other words, to put it in a
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.720]   different form. Here once more we have one of those glorious statements which
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.880]   teach us as to how we should view this great salvation. Now that is something to
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   which the Bible is always calling us. Let me put it in an immediate practical form
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   by putting it like this. Here we are in this season of Advent. Here we are in
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.640]   these Sundays, in these days which are leading up to Christmas Day, which
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.960]   reminds us of the coming of the Son of God into this world. The season, I say, of
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.760]   Advent. Now how do we view it? I suppose there is no better test of our
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   profession of the Christian faith than just that. What's our attitude towards it?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.320]   Is it merely the attitude of the world, which is purely sentimental, quite pagan,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.800]   it really has nothing to do with Christianity at all? Is it that? Is our
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.760]   thinking of this matter governed by that? Or do we think of this
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.160]   season of Advent in the terms that the Bible itself always uses as it makes
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.640]   reference to it? Because I think anybody who's ever read the Bible must agree
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.120]   with this, that every single reference to this Advent of the Son of God into this
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.160]   world in the Scriptures is always in superlative terms. Go back to your Old
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   Testament, look at your prophets. You will find that those prophets reach their
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.120]   greatest heights always when they are foretelling the coming of the Son of God
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.800]   into this world. Think of some of those most glorious passages in Isaiah. And you
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.000]   will find that he rises to his greatest heights invariably. As he is describing
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.280]   this, think of the 40th chapter for instance, which bursts out with its great
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.880]   message of "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith our God." Speaking comfortably to
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.360]   Jerusalem, and how the poetic imagery is piled up one on top of another, and his
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.080]   mightiest eloquence is poured forth. It's all because he's thinking of this
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.320]   Advent. And the same thing is true with all the other prophetic writers. And as
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.160]   you come over into the New Testament, you will find that the most glorious
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.640]   passages are always the passages that deal with this and treat of this. "Great
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.960]   is the mystery of godliness," says Paul. He's always bursting forth into some kind
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.360]   of praise and a thanksgiving as he contemplates the greatness and the glory
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.920]   of the thing. It's the most astounding thing that has ever happened in the
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.680]   world, or ever will happen in this world. The Advent, the coming of the Son of God
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.000]   into the world, the carrying out of this great plan and purpose of salvation, is
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.600]   ever in the Bible, I say, a theme for endless praise and glorying and
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:26.360]   thanksgiving. Now the question I therefore ask is this. Is that our
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:34.720]   response to it? Do we view it in that way? Is that the effect that it has upon us? I
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.440]   ask my question for this good reason, that as human beings we all tend to show
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:49.360]   our reactions, we all tend to show our enthusiasms. You have but to be passing
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   a football ground on a Saturday afternoon to know that people, when
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.320]   they're really interested, express that very definitely, and it can be heard
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.560]   without much trouble. Or if you watch them looking at a film or listening to a
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.920]   play or anything that interests or attracts them, they very soon show their
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   appreciation. They're keen about a thing, or if they've read a book, they must be
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.440]   telling everybody about it and talking about it. I wonder how as Christian
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.960]   people we manifest our interest in the advent of the Son of God into this world.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.360]   There's no question as to how the Bible does. I've just been reminding you its
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.160]   highest heights of eloquence are produced by this. Does it have that
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.240]   effect upon us, I wonder? Surely this is the real trouble with the church today,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.640]   and surely this is why the people, the masses of the people, are outside the
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.080]   church. We somehow fail to give the impression that we have got here the
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.040]   most glorious, the most wonderful thing that has ever come into this world. We
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.120]   are lethargic and half-hearted, uncertain and apologetic. We are not singing and
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.920]   praising, and the result is people pay very little attention to the fact that
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.760]   we happen to call ourselves Christian people. Well now then, I say we are
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.520]   reminded here that the whole atmosphere of salvation is one of praise, to the
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:19.160]   praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.880]   Well then, in view of all this, let us try to discover, if we can, in order that we
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.480]   may cease to be the lethargic apologetic type of Christian and rather conform to
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.360]   the biblical pattern, let us ask this question. Why should this thought of
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.760]   Advent really lead to praise and to worship and to adoration? Well, the first
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.440]   answer I find here is this, that the first and the greatest thing, after all,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:56.600]   about salvation is that it is a revelation of the glory of God to the
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.880]   praise of the glory of his grace, or if you prefer it, to the praise of his glory
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:11.320]   as it is manifested through his grace or by means of his grace. And that is why to
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.460]   translate this instead of "to the praise of the glory of his grace" as "to the
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.200]   praise of his glorious grace" is a weakening of what the Apostle rarely
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.360]   said and meant. And again it's unfortunate that the Revised Standard
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.640]   Version should have done that. It's one of those ways again in which something
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.080]   is taken from the truth. It isn't his glorious grace, it is the glory of his
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:44.640]   grace, the glory of God as it is revealed and manifested through his grace. Now, I
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:52.040]   say that this is the chiefest reason for praise. The first thing and ultimately
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.600]   the most important thing about salvation is that it is a revelation and a
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:03.840]   manifestation of the glory of God. What do we mean by that? When we say the glory
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.400]   of God, what exactly does that represent and connote? It's very difficult to
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.600]   answer that question because our language, our terminology, our categories
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.320]   are quite inadequate to convey any impression of the glory of God. But we
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:30.440]   can say this much, the glory of God is the essential being of God. The glory of
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.600]   God is that which really makes God, God. It is the very essence of God. We are
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.640]   told, you remember by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, that the Lord
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:49.560]   Jesus Christ is not only the express image of the person of God, but is the
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.320]   brightness or the effulgence of the glory of God. If there is one term that
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.500]   describes God more than another, it is this word glory. What does it include?
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:09.080]   Well, it includes these ideas. It includes beauty. It includes majesty.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:15.560]   Better still, perhaps, is the word splendor. It, of course, includes the idea
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:23.200]   of greatness, of might, and of eternity. They're all summed up in this one
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.240]   word, glory, and we really can't get beyond that. But it does include those
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:34.760]   separate ideas, an ineffable greatness, and majesty, and might, and beauty, and a
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:41.560]   splendor that is iridescent and radiant in and of itself. Well, take the biblical
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:52.640]   term God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. The glory of God. Now,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:00.280]   this, I say, is the first and the chiefest thing about salvation, that it brings to
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.920]   us the glory of God. It's a manifestation, a revelation of this glory, this majesty,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:15.360]   this splendor of God. It brings that to us, or brings us to that, if you like.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.440]   Now, you will notice that in the Old Testament, this is the term that is always
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:29.520]   used to convey the immediate presence of God, the glory of God. We read that
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   passage from the first book of Kings, in the eighth chapter, in order that we
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.880]   might remind ourselves of that at the beginning. We are told that at that
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:47.360]   given point, the glory of the Lord filled the temple. And let us remember this, that
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:54.160]   in that temple, the glory of God always dwelt in that innermost sanctuary of all.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:03.240]   There, with the cherubim, above the mercy seat, was this Shekinah glory. And you
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.400]   remember that we are told that even the high priest himself was only allowed to
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:15.040]   enter into that holiest of all, but once a year, and then not without blood. Why?
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.680]   Well, because the glory of God dwelt there. "Shall God indeed dwell with men?"
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.880]   asked Solomon in surprise. The answer is yes. He dwelt there in the holiest of all.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.040]   There was his presence hovering over the mercy seat, and the high
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.400]   priest, this chosen representative, is only allowed to go into the presence
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.800]   once a year with the blood of sacrifice. He was going into the presence of God on
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:53.420]   behalf of the people. Now that gives us some idea of it. And you notice that the
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.760]   idea is always very intimately linked with this whole conception of salvation.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.000]   God dwells there in the holiest of all, above the mercy seat, because it is the
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.120]   point, the place, at which the sin of men is dealt with. Sin has come
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   between God and men, but there God has provided the way, and therefore he meets
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.800]   men there at the mercy seat. The blood of sacrifice is offered, the law is there,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.400]   and is covered by this blood, and there God meets with men. The idea of the glory
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.000]   of God, you see, is always introduced in connection with God visiting men in
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.600]   salvation, in some shape or form. Now it's very interesting to trace this right
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:48.200]   through the Old Testament. In a rather surprising way, the first time we meet
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:55.620]   it in a sense, is after men had sinned. Before that, we are told that God
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.760]   communed with men, and men with God in the garden, and all was paradise and
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   perfect. But men, alas, listened to the devil, and he sinned, and he fell, and he was
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.600]   turned out of the garden. And then you remember what we are told, that God set
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.280]   at the east end of the garden a flaming sword with a cherubim, prohibiting men
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.040]   to come back and to have access to the tree of life. And that flaming sword and
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.840]   the cherubim are nothing but a manifestation and a demonstration of the
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.600]   glory of God. The glory of God stands there, as it were, preventing men by his
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.800]   own effort to come back. He's not allowed to have this privilege. It's the glory of
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.440]   God that confronts him, and he falls back when he sees it, because of its
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:51.400]   transcendent character. And as you go on through your Old Testament, you will find
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.440]   that this is there always. You remember that Abraham had some conception of this
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.800]   given to him. Read the 17th chapter of the book of Genesis, and you'll find it.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.440]   There was a great light, and a darkness came upon him, and he didn't quite know
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.000]   whether he was awake or asleep, and God was making a covenant with him at that
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   point. It's still the glory of God overshadowing. You remember how, as the
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:23.600]   children of Israel traveled from Egypt and in their Exodus and to the land of
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:30.040]   Canaan, there was a pillar of cloud by day and a fire by night ever with them,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.600]   and it was that which decided when they moved and went on. The pillar was above
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.320]   the tabernacle, you remember, and they were never to move until it rose and
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:46.880]   went on. It's God saving his people, manifesting his glory in their salvation.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.200]   And do you remember the description that Isaiah gives us of this? When he was
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.160]   called to his prophetic office and to announce the coming of the Savior, the
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.240]   whole place was filled with smoke, and the posts of the door began to shake. The
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.560]   glory of the Lord had been manifested to him, and he says, "I am a man of unclean
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:13.200]   lips." The glory of the Lord was so great that he saw himself in his sinfulness
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.080]   and in his wretchedness. Work through it for yourselves. I've simply extracted
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.440]   some of the most notable examples of it. But, of course, it is when we come to the
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.800]   New Testament that we find this still more accentuated. Do you remember the
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.200]   first statement that we read of in connection with the coming of the Son of
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:44.360]   God, the carrying out of this great salvation? It's this. We are told that the
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.400]   multitude, that a great multitude of the heavenly host was heard crying out and
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:58.920]   saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill amongst men." But you
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.600]   notice the order. Salvation, the Son has been born, the babe has arrived, and he's
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600]   there in the manger in Bethlehem. What's the response? "Glory to God in the highest."
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   That's the first thing. And only afterwards, peace, goodwill amongst men.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.840]   You see, the moment salvation is mentioned, it's the glory of God that's
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.600]   prominent. It's a revelation of this above everything else. And it's not
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:34.280]   surprising, therefore, that the Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, says that
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:40.520]   there has been committed unto him the gospel of the glory of the blessed God.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:47.160]   Or that, in writing to the Corinthians, he should say, "God who commended the light to
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.100]   shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts." What for? "To reveal the light of
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:22:00.960]   the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." My friends, that's
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.680]   what Advent means. That's the explanation of what happened when the Son of God
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   came into this world. The glory of God has been revealed, has been manifested
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   amongst us. It's God coming to us and revealing himself and his glory. Very
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.840]   well, then, I say once more that that is the way in which we should be thinking
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:33.640]   of Advent and of salvation. Does it fill us this morning with a sense of wonder
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.920]   and of praise and of astonishment and of amazement as we realize what God has
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.320]   done? Do you know we've been called to that? To the praise of the glory of his
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:57.640]   grace? As the chief thing about sin is that it means we are not giving to God
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   the glory that is his due? So, the chief thing about salvation is that it is a
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.640]   revelation of the glory of God. You see, our thinking has gone altogether wrong.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.680]   When we think of sin, what do we think of? Well, we tend to think of certain
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.200]   actions. We think of sin in terms of sins, and when we say, "I have sinned," what we
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.440]   mean is, "I did something I shouldn't have done, and I was sorry afterwards, and
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.040]   I'm bearing the consequences." My dear friend, that is perfectly true about sin,
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.080]   but that isn't the most terrible thing about sin. The most awful thing about sin
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:41.280]   is this, that there in that act you are not giving to God the glory that is his
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:52.680]   due. We have been made that we might glorify God. The chief end of men is to
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:59.840]   glorify God and to enjoy him forever, and the very essence of sin is a failure to
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:07.960]   glorify God. And on the other hand, when we think of salvation, we must not think
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.120]   of salvation in the first instance as our deliverance from particular sins or
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.840]   our deliverance from condemnation. It is that. Thank God for it. But you know, the
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.880]   most glorious thing about it is this, the glory of God has been revealed in it, and
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:31.720]   has come to us, and has embraced us where we are. So that I say that all our
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:38.400]   thinking about salvation should always be primarily in terms of the glory of
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.720]   God. And this is the thing that troubles me so much about so much modern
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.300]   evangelism, that it's all in terms of some benefit to men, and God seems to be
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.000]   forgotten. And we need deliverance from this and that, and we need this help and
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.040]   that, and Christ can give it, and the glory of God is never mentioned. And it
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.960]   is because we forget the glory of God as the primary of thing that our
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.720]   evangelistic methods also are often far removed from what you find in the New
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:17.320]   Testament. But the first and the chiefest thing about salvation, whatever we may
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.600]   think or say, is that it is a revelation and a manifestation of the glory of the
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:32.840]   ineffable God. But let us move on. The second principle I find here is that
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:40.200]   our salvation is the highest manifestation of the glory of God. It is
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.960]   not only that it is a manifestation of the glory of God, it's the highest
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:50.160]   manifestation of it. It isn't the only manifestation of it, but it is the highest
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:58.800]   manifestation. The glory of God is displayed in everything that God does.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   God, whenever he does anything, manifests his glory. It's to be seen in nature,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:11.840]   isn't it? The heavens declare the glory of God. And it is because you and I are so
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.240]   blinded by sin that we don't see that every time we look into the heavens. We
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.600]   look into the heavens and we think of some scientist or some man who's talking
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:29.920]   about distances. The heavens, says the psalmist, declare the glory of God. He made
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.560]   them, he set them, he ordered the planets and set them in their courses. It is he
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.280]   who has ordained the seasons, the wind and the rain. Paul expounds all that in
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.680]   the 14th of Acts. And indeed he tells us in the first chapter of the epistle to
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.280]   the Romans that ultimately what makes men inexcusable in sin is that the
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.360]   invisible things of him have been revealed, that God has manifested his
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.600]   glory as the maker and the creator, but men didn't see it. He worshipped the
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:09.200]   creature rather than the creator. The glory of God is seen in these flowers in
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   front of us. Look at their perfect order, look at the design and the arrangement,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.840]   the blending of the colors. Is this accident and chance out upon the
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.960]   suggestion it's the glorious God who's made them? It's a reflection of something
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:33.360]   of his own perfect being, the glory of God. You see it in history likewise. You
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:40.280]   see it in providence. You see it in that hand that is overruling all the schemes
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:46.120]   of men throughout the centuries. Read of the great rise and development of
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.640]   dynasties and of civilizations and of their wane. There is only one explanation
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.800]   of it all. It's God ruling it all and not allowing anyone to rise to a position
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:02.520]   of final supremacy. Even secular history manifests the glory of God, but if you
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.840]   want to see it still more clearly read the Old Testament history. And in the
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.540]   flood, and in the exodus, in the opening of the Red Sea, in the dividing of
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:23.000]   Jordan, in the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, what do you see? The glory of God
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   everywhere dominating the whole history. But the point I am emphasizing this
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   morning is this, that it is redemption that finally reveals it at its greatest
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:40.600]   height and at its most pure magnificence. How does it do it? Well, it is in
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.800]   redemption we see finally the wisdom of God. You see the wisdom of God in nature
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.680]   and creation in history, as I've been explaining, but if you really want to see
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.040]   the wisdom of God why you've got to come and look into the face of Christ who is
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:02.480]   the wisdom of God, says Paul to the Corinthians, and the power of God. Have
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.720]   you ever thought of the marvelous way in which God has contrived our salvation?
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   There is man in sin, estranged from God and involved in troubles. Look what the
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.120]   world has tried to do about him. Read your philosophy books, read your history
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.600]   books, read about your educational schemes, your plans for utopia. Man has
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.680]   been trying to save men, and look what he's made of it. And put over against all
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.560]   that God's way of salvation in Christ, there's the wisdom of God. Man had never
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.440]   thought of it, could never have imagined it. That's God's way, and it's the glory
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:47.880]   of God revealed through his wisdom in redemption. Or take his power. The power
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   of God can be seen in the earthquake and in the storm, in the avalanche, in the
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:30:00.240]   power of a river and of a flood. It's all the power of God. And you know if you and
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.720]   I were truly Christian, every time we hear a thunderclap or see a flash of
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:13.040]   lightning, we should say, "Praise God!" It's a manifestation of his might. But all that
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:19.440]   is nothing by comparison with the power of God as revealed in redemption. His
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.000]   power in defeating Satan causes every other power of his to pale into
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.760]   insignificance. And think of his power in the resurrection. Paul is going to speak
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.400]   of that in this chapter. He says, "I wish the eyes of your understanding were
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.200]   enlightened, that you might know the exceeding greatness of his power to us
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.760]   who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:50.040]   Christ when he raised him from the dead." That's the power that God had to deal
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.160]   with, the power of the devil, the power of Satan, the power of death, the power of
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.520]   hell and the grave, and he's mastered and conquered them all. That's the measure
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:07.560]   of his power revealed in redemption. And it's exactly the same with his holiness
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:15.040]   and his righteousness. The ancient law reveals to us the holiness and the
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   righteousness and the justice of God, his view of sin and his condemnation of it.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.200]   But my dear friends, if we want to know anything about the holiness and the
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.640]   righteousness and the justice of God, we must hasten away to Calvary's hill and
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.120]   stand there and look and ask, "Why this?" And there's only one answer, the holiness
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.000]   of God. The holiness of God is such that he cannot deal with a sinner except this
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.360]   should happen. Nothing less than the death of his son is sufficient to
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:54.400]   satisfy the holy demands of this righteous just God. So he hath set him
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.840]   forth as the propitiation for sins to declare his righteousness. And there's
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.320]   never been a greater declaration of it, the glory of God revealed in this way.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:15.280]   But of course finally the glory of God is revealed supremely in his grace. It
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.840]   isn't that I'm comparing these things or trying to say that one is greater than
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.200]   another. I'm talking about wisdom and about power and about holiness and
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:30.760]   righteousness. But it is the grace of God that finally reveals his glory most of
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:36.520]   all. Not so much what he's done for us but that he should ever have done it. In
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.120]   view of our rebellion and our sinfulness and our vileness, why did he ever look
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.400]   upon us? Why is he troubled with us? The answer is his grace. And you don't know
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.560]   the glory of God until you see it in the face of Jesus Christ and the grace that
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:33:01.240]   streams from it. It was because he had seen something of this that Samuel Davis
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:08.260]   cried out saying, "Great God of wonders, all thy ways are matchless, godlike and
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:19.520]   divine. But the fair glories of thy grace more godlike and unrivaled shine." It's
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:25.920]   there you see his glory. But let me hasten before I close to say something
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:34.120]   still more astonishing in a sense. That all that I've been saying is to be
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:42.720]   revealed finally in and through you and myself. God has chosen us to holiness. He
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:50.600]   has predestinated us to the adoption of sons to this end. It is by making us his
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:57.200]   children, it is by making us holy, that God reveals this particular glory of his.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.240]   Listen to Paul putting it in this very epistle in the third chapter in the
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.160]   tenth verse. He says, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:20.000]   heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God." It is
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.640]   through you and through me that God reveals this grace of his and this glory
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:32.080]   of his. It is something, says Peter, that the very angels desire to look into and
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.440]   they don't understand, but it's true. "All mine are thine and thine are mine," says
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:52.160]   the Son to the Father in the seventeenth of John, "and I am glorified in them. Let
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   your light so shine before men," he says again, "that they may see your good works,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:03.920]   but glorify your Father which is in heaven." Beloved people, we've been called
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.040]   to this, to the praise of the glory of his grace. We are to live like that and
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:16.800]   conduct ourselves like that, that as men and women look at us and see us, they
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:24.760]   shall be compelled to say, "What a glorious God!" Nothing can explain this and
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.040]   these people saved the glory of the Almighty God in redemption in Christ. We
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:38.640]   are to the praise of the glory of his grace. So that brings me to my ultimate
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:45.880]   statement which is this. How should we view ourselves in the light of all this?
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:53.200]   And here is the Apostle's answer. Listen. "We have been called and chosen to the
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:02.960]   praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved."
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:08.240]   Now this is a most tremendous statement.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.680]   Unfortunately the revised version which you have in front of you and the
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   revised standard version have again, it seems to me, gone tragically astray in
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:27.040]   their translation here. You will read there that he has freely bestowed on us
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.720]   in the Beloved this grace. They read to the praise of the glory of his grace
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:41.200]   which he hath freely bestowed upon us in the Beloved. The authorized is in which
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:49.600]   he has made us accepted in the Beloved. But here I think we find that the
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.640]   authorized version as well as the revised and the revised standard version
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.000]   have all of them failed really to bring out what the Apostle said. What has he
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.640]   said? Well here is the interesting answer. The word that the Apostle uses here was
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.680]   the very word, the exact word that is used in the Gospel according to
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:22.240]   St. Luke in the first chapter and the 28th verse which we read at the beginning.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:30.680]   Now still more interesting, this word that the Apostle uses here is only used
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.640]   again in the whole of the New Testament in Luke 1 28 and this is how it's
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:45.280]   translated there. Listen. "The angel came in unto Mary and said, Hail, thou that art
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou amongst women." Now the
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:01.680]   word is "highly favored." The revised standard puts that like this, "Hail, O
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:08.520]   favored one." The revised version has it, "Hail, thou that art highly favored." It's
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   right there. But why not translate it in exactly the same way when it appears
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:21.040]   here in the epistle to the Ephesians? Because as I say it's exactly the same
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:33.200]   word. "To the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he is highly favored in the
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:41.720]   beloved." Surely that is the meaning that the Apostle was anxious to convey. He
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:49.080]   uses the same language about us as the angel used about the Virgin Mary. The
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.600]   angel goes to the Virgin Mary and says, "Hail, thou that hast been highly favored."
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.680]   He means this. He says, "Do you know that God has chosen you of all the women in
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:08.000]   the world to bear his Son? God has privileged you, has highly favored you. He
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.040]   selected you for this, that the Son of God should enter into your womb and be
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:21.760]   born of you. You are highly favored." And here the Apostle says exactly the same
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:30.040]   thing about us. He's already told us that we have been adopted unto the adoption of
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:38.760]   sons. Ah yes, but it's more than that. Not only are we made sons of God, but Christ
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   comes into us. Christ in you, the hope of glory. That Christ, says Paul to the
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   Galatians, may be formed in you. We are highly favored as Mary was. Physically he
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.440]   entered into her. Spiritually he enters into every one of us who are his
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:04.640]   children. Christ in us. "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.940]   called the Son of God." Yes, and because we are partakers of the divine nature, we
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:20.600]   are the sons of God. He is in us, Christ within us, in Mary, in us. Highly favored.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:31.080]   God has chosen us. We don't know why, but all the privilege, all the favor, highly
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   favored one, you are the Christian. God in his infinite wisdom, in his infinite
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:51.100]   love and grace and mercy, before the very foundation of the world, decided that you
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:59.080]   and I were to be highly favored. And that by his grace we should not only be
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:05.000]   redeemed from the ravages and the consequences of sin and be adopted into
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:18.480]   his family, but that into us his very Son should come to dwell. Christ in you. Our
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:30.120]   bodies, the very temple of the Holy Ghost himself. That is the Apostles conception
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:37.360]   of the Christian. That is how you and I should habitually and normally think of
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.840]   ourselves as we walk the streets of this city and engage in our work with all
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:49.160]   other men and women. We see them in the darkness of sin. Why am I what I am?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:59.640]   And there's only one answer. I have been highly favored. God, in spite of me, has
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:10.920]   done this to me and for me. I am what I am, solely and entirely by the grace of
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:24.840]   God. I give him all the glory. There is none in me, him that glorieth. Let him
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.040]   glory in the Lord. Does your view of salvation give the entire glory to God,
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.080]   or are you reserving a little for yourself? Are you saying that it's your
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.600]   faith, it's your believing that's done it? If so, you're detracting from the glory
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:55.000]   of God. It's entirely his, to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.040]   highly favored us in the beloved. Amen.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.200]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
