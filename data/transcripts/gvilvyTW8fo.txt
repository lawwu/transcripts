[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Well, this is an important and too common theme
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.640]   in our inbox, a question over men belittling women
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640]   as inferior, perhaps in the name of complementarity even.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.040]   I see this too often in the inbox and emails from wives
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.320]   and we haven't covered this yet head on.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   I wish we didn't have to, but we do.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500]   Dear Pastor John, my husband and I have been married
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.840]   for nearly 30 years.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.180]   He's grown convinced that there is something wrong with me.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.040]   I'm a Christian and have been since I was 10 years old.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.120]   He is also convinced that God sees me as subservient
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.280]   to him and in every way.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.760]   Tonight I asked him if he believes women are subservient
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.240]   to men in creation and he answered without hesitation, yes.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.800]   He has always treated me like he is superior
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.680]   to me in every way.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.400]   The way he treats me is very hurtful
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.480]   and I don't think I can continue to go on
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.880]   with his angry, aggressive spirit.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.920]   When he gets angry with me about anything,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.720]   he locks me out of the bedroom and out of the house.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.280]   I literally want to run away.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.720]   I despise this life.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.480]   Please help encourage wives who are treated like this,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.560]   who are treated as inferior.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.680]   - Perhaps it will be of some help.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.880]   I hope so.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.760]   If I explain from a biblical standpoint,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   five sinful, damaging mistakes,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.560]   this man is making and which he should be held
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.960]   accountable for.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   She doesn't say if he claims to be a Christian or not.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.480]   He certainly is not acting like one,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   but some man or men need to step in to his life
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.320]   and call him to account for these five sins.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.400]   Now, before I mentioned the five sinful
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.040]   and damaging mistakes he's making,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.160]   let me go behind them to something deeper
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.680]   because there's always something deeper
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   than the principles from which we behave.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.600]   He clearly has some principles from which he is behaving
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.280]   and it is clear that behind them is something deeper.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   Namely, he is in significant bondage
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   to the root sin of selfishness and pride.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   That is, he himself occupies such a central place
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.080]   in his own preferences that he cannot see or feel
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.360]   the beauty of getting outside himself
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   and finding joy in living for the good and gladness
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.100]   of another person.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.560]   Now, there's a fancy name for this today.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.520]   It's called narcissism.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   He is so fixated on himself and his pleasures
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   and his privileges and his rights
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.560]   that counting another person more significant
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   than himself is literally, literally inconceivable.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.600]   If you were to speak those words to him
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   from Philippians 2, 3,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.360]   count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.320]   If you were to speak those words to him,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.680]   they would be like a foreign language.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.760]   They would not even connect.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.660]   They would be like wind blowing in the curtains.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.240]   So there's the root.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   The biblical words are sin, not narcissism.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.720]   That's a new fancy word.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.560]   It may or may not be helpful,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.040]   but the biblical words are solid and forever.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.920]   Sin, pride, and self-exaltation
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.480]   until God breaks in and reveals to this man
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.600]   the deep ugliness of his soul
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   so that he weeps and weeps with conviction
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.800]   and contrition that are not intended
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.040]   to manipulate anything or anybody.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.800]   These five sinful traits that I'm gonna talk about
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.520]   probably won't change.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.640]   That's the miracle that we have to pray
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.080]   toward every Christian has experienced this miracle.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.920]   It's called the new birth,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.200]   and God can cause it in the worst of sinners.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.560]   So that's the direction I pray.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   So here are my five sinful, damaging mistakes he's making.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.020]   Number one, he thinks there is in creation,
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.700]   that is the way the world is made,
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.720]   a built-in subservience for women.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.040]   She says, "Tonight I asked him
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.440]   "if he believes women are subservient to men in creation,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.400]   "and he answered without hesitation, 'Yes.'"
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   Now, I'm assuming from the word subservient
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.460]   and from the fruit of this man's conviction
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.720]   that what he sees in creation is very different
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.360]   from what creation actually teaches.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.480]   If we go to Genesis 2 and 3
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.600]   and watch creation unfold sequentially
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.480]   after the foundational statement in 127
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.180]   that men and women are created equally in God's image,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.480]   what we see is, number one, and there are more,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.240]   I'm just summing up a few.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Number one, that man was created first
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.640]   and given the instructions for life in the garden
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.800]   so that he, by God's design,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.200]   has a kind of unique responsibility
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   that will be unlike his wife's responsibility.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   Number two, God says in 2:18,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.980]   "It's not good for this man to be alone.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.600]   "I will make a helper fit for him."
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.920]   So a woman is created, unlike the animals,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   from Adam's side, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.960]   that is deeply alike and yet so wonderfully different
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.020]   called a helper fit,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.600]   that is suitable, completing, complementing.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.440]   That is, by the way,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.860]   where the word complementarian originated
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.760]   from that word fit or suitable or complementary
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.260]   in Genesis 2.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.960]   Then third, the tempter came
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.280]   and the man failed to take the responsibility
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.480]   God had given him.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   You can see that in 3:6,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.960]   "The woman took of the fruit and ate,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.560]   "and she gave some to her husband who was with her."
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.880]   Crucial words in verse six, "Who was with her, and he ate."
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.200]   In other words, he was there falling right into line
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   with the devil's assault on God's wise and good order
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.320]   by being silent when the enemy was attacking his wife.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.600]   And then four, sin ravages the beautiful relationship
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.560]   that God had created, this complementary relationship.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.280]   Sin ravages that relationship,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.400]   and you see it because the man blames the woman
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.880]   and says, "Look, if you're gonna punish somebody,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.400]   "punish her 'cause you gave her to me and she tempted me."
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   In other words, God's really the problem here.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.640]   It's a devastating description of the ravages of the fall
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.080]   in human relationships and divine relationships.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.840]   So what creation teaches,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.880]   so what creation teaches is that man was designed
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.360]   to be thrilled by his partner helper,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.960]   Paul calls her his glory in 1 Corinthians 11,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720]   gladly bearing a unique responsibility
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.760]   to take a special initiative to protect her.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   Who was superior to whom and on what counts was irrelevant
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.920]   for the central issue of love and protection.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.600]   They were in God's image and perfectly suited
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.120]   to each other's fruitfulness and joy.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.720]   They were naked and not ashamed.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   They did not shame each other.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.240]   The fact that they were profoundly the same
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   and wonderfully different in God's design caused no shame.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.040]   So this husband that we were just being asked about,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   this husband has deeply misread creation.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.400]   That's sinful mistake number one.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.760]   Number two, his second sinful mistake
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   is to infer from creation a built-in
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.280]   superior inferior relationship.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.880]   She says, "He has always treated me
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.360]   like he is superior to me in every way."
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.920]   Men superior, women inferior.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.560]   And she says, "In every way."
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.080]   There are two kinds of mistake here.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.600]   They're both serious.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   One is to fail to distinguish whether the words superior
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.880]   and inferior refer to greater or lesser value.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Don't even address that.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.240]   Don't even have such a thing in mind.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   And the other is to fail to distinguish capacities
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.920]   and competencies in which women are in general
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.520]   superior to men and competencies and capacities
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.040]   in which men are in general superior to women.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.840]   And those differences do not imply greater
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.920]   or lesser value in personhood.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.080]   Who you are in God's image.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   So this husband is sinfully inferring
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.960]   an undifferentiated superiority for men,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.840]   for himself in particular, that does not exist.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.560]   Third, the third sinful mistake he makes
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   is by inferring from superior inferior paradigm
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.000]   for men and women that he may therefore
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.880]   rightly treat his wife in demeaning ways.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   So he moves from misreading creation
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.120]   to misconceiving the meaning of superiority and inferiority
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   to justify demeaning behavior.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.360]   This is evil at several levels.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.880]   I'll just mention one.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.300]   In 1 Peter 3, 7, Peter says,
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   "Husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.680]   for according to knowledge,
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.720]   showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.000]   since she is a fellow heir with you of the grace of life."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Here's the point this man is totally missing.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Even when one focuses on an area where women are weaker,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.180]   the biblical, the Christian response of a husband
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.100]   is not demeaning, but honoring.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.500]   There's the catch, deep, profound, serious thing
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.240]   he's blind to.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.020]   Actually, the way the verse in 1 Peter 3, 7 is structured,
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.060]   you have the central term showing honor,
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060]   and on one side of it is woman as weaker vessel,
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.800]   and on the other side is woman as fellow heir of glory,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   which means that this man is utterly oblivious to this,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.280]   that whether you focus on any particular weakness
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   or on destined for glory, the call is the same.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.860]   Honor, honor, honor, not shame, shame, shame.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.140]   Honor, not demeaning, and he can't see it.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.140]   Number four, his sinful mistake that he makes
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.700]   is that he lives now with anger and aggressiveness.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.760]   This is his prison cell.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   Given what he sees and feels, anger is inevitable.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.780]   He's living outside of God's good design,
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.500]   and the inevitable dissonance causes continual aggravation.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.940]   James says, "Let every person,"
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.640]   this would apply to this husband,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.880]   "Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.480]   "slow to anger, for the anger of man
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.500]   "does not produce the righteousness of God."
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.940]   Oh my goodness, what an important text for marriage.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.180]   And then finally, number five,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.180]   the result of living in the bondage of sin and delusion
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.540]   is acting like a jailer.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.620]   Let me just make sure you heard the paradox there.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.580]   The result of being in bondage to sin
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.620]   makes you act like a jailer to hide the fact
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.780]   that he's in jail.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.900]   He has become a childish bully, right?
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.700]   He's become a childish bully,
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.100]   locking her out of the bedroom and the house.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.860]   This is pathetic.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.600]   It's like a child throwing a tantrum,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.060]   only he's bigger now.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.020]   So instead of running into his bedroom
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.020]   and slamming the door against his parents,
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.960]   he can run in and lock her out.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.980]   Now, she didn't ask me for any counsel.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.280]   She just wanted me to say something that might be helpful
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.580]   in general when women are dealing with a man like this.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.520]   But let me go ahead and say what I think.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.620]   I'm assuming there hasn't been physical abuse.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.300]   She didn't say that.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.900]   And the reason I'm telling you that
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.240]   is because what I'm about to say would be different
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.420]   if there were, in other words,
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.620]   if he is brutalizing her,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.380]   then she is, I think, obliged, rightly and legally,
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.580]   to go to police and to the ways
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.700]   that the arm of our government has set up
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   for helping women or men deal with that kind of brutality.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:39.660]   But short of that, she should be, I think, stepping forward,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.100]   and I do hope she's in a church where this is possible,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.340]   to go to trusted elders, tell them her situation,
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.140]   and ask for them to intervene.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.300]   I think it's part of the elder's job of a church
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.340]   to step into the lives of the sheep,
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.340]   men and women, and be a part of their protective shield
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.340]   and to give them guidance and wisdom
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.020]   for how to move forward.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.700]   - Sobered, straightforward, clear words.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.260]   Next time, we talk about fertility technology
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.900]   and whether or not IVF babies are knit together
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.980]   in the womb by God.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.780]   Does human technology override the ways
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.940]   we talk about natural conception
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.900]   and the origin of human life?
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.660]   It's a really great question, and it's up next.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.020]   We'll see you next time on Monday.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.060]   Have a great weekend.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:44.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
