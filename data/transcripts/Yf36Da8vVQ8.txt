[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Reproducibility Challenge encourages people to evaluate the results of papers published
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320]   at top conferences.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.360]   Here at Weights & Biases, we care about open and transparent machine learning research,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.600]   so we make tools that let you track everything you need to make your models reproducible,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.400]   from hyperparameters in code to model weights and dataset versions.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.880]   Here's how Weights & Biases can help you participating in the challenge.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   In this example, Deganta attempts to reproduce a paper from the CVPR conference.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.840]   First, he leverages WNB tools to interactively plot segmentations and bounding boxes results
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.840]   he got.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.080]   Then, to plot validation accuracies of models with different attention mechanisms during
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   training.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.660]   Lastly, he uses hyperparameter sweeps to test the robustness of the four attention mechanisms
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.880]   presented with the hyperparameter changes.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   The parameter plot shows which combination of one attention mechanism's batch sizes
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.880]   and optimizers leads to what loss.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.520]   And we can also see how much each hyperparameter correlates with the lower loss.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.440]   With WNB, you can also use artifacts to keep track of different versions of your models
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.200]   and your datasets and have all the freedom of how you'd like to conduct your experiments
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   and monitor them with custom charts.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.840]   If you think of an iceberg, and stay with me on this, the final result, the paper, it's
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.040]   just the tip of it.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.640]   There are countless experiments that led somewhere or did and that never see the light of day.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.040]   Tracking your experiments with Weights & Biases, you can now share your entire project dashboard
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.440]   that has all the information about the models you trained, giving your readers a fuller
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.360]   picture and ensuring that your results will be reproducible.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.640]   A great way to make a submission to the challenge is to write a WNB report as you would normally
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760]   write a submission paper.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.200]   Think of a report as an article written with Markdown and Lattek where you can include
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.640]   and display all the interactive charts that you got from tracking your experiments.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.760]   For instance, here Deganta talks about which parts of the analyzed paper were easy to reproduce
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580]   and which were not.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.040]   And after writing a WNB report, you can easily generate submission files in the right format
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.640]   for the challenge.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900]   Just go to Download, Lattek, Reproducibility Challenge Template.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.040]   This will give you a zip file which you can continue editing on Overleaf and then submit
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.000]   it to the challenge.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.840]   Now you have a report with interactive charts that you can share anywhere online and a submission
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.600]   doc in the right format for the challenge.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.480]   We realize that reproducing papers can be expensive, so we will provide $500 grants
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.160]   to offset computing costs to participants upon submission who meet Reproducibility Challenge
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   and Weights and Biases guidelines.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.120]   To see the guidelines and learn more, visit Call for Reproducibility on Ocean Doc, link
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   in the description.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   Also, links in the description will be for Deganta's report and our Slack community
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:34.040]   where you can chat with other people reproducing papers in the ML Reproducibility Channel.
