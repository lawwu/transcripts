[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   - And what do you guys think about inspections
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   when the seller's already done the inspections
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.480]   and they're in the disclosures?
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.120]   Do you still recommend people go do them themselves also?
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.040]   - Usually not.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.760]   The fear is, well, that's the seller's inspector.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.620]   But the inspectors themselves are licensed professionals
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.200]   that don't really care who the seller is, who the buyer is.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.560]   They just wanna make sure they don't miss anything
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.960]   so they don't get sued.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.140]   So what I tell my clients when you're getting inspections
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.640]   someone else has done, is call the home inspector
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920]   and ask them, like, you can actually do that,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.800]   especially if you're the one who pays for the inspection.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.480]   But even if you're not, hey, I see in your inspection
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   line 9C2 shows this.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.280]   Is that something I should be worried about?
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800]   You get great information from home inspectors.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.740]   They give you the context that's often missing,
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.880]   especially 'cause when you're first buying a house,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.160]   or even if you've owned a lot of houses,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800]   we don't know what a lot of that stuff means.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.360]   You see a report and it lists something,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640]   you're like, well, is that a bad thing or not a bad thing?
