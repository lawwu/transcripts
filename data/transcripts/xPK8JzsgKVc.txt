[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Well, what is the role of Pentecostalism in the world today?
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.180]   It was a question put to John Piper in early June at one of his international stops.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.520]   He was doing a television interview in Monticevano, Italy, and there he was asked the question.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520]   Here's a field recording of what he said.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   Pentecostalism in the world.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   Well, it's huge.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:36.240]   I mean, when you think of the awakening of evangelicalism, true lovers of the gospel,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.840]   lovers of being born again, lovers of scripture, lovers of the Bible, lovers of evangelism
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:53.280]   and world missions, when you think of that evangelicalism, it is decreasing in the Western
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.240]   world to an extent.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.120]   At least over the last century, it has hugely decreased, right?
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.400]   In Europe, which was once the center of evangelicalism, today is very small.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:15.320]   Whereas at the beginning of the 20th century, probably 5% of Africa were evangelical, and
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   today it would be close to 50%.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   Same thing in South America, same thing in Asia.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.040]   Now, if you ask, "What's the nature of that evangelicalism?"
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   It's mainly Pentecostal.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   So Pentecostalism, that is people, this is my definition, people who are believing in
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.200]   the power of the Holy Spirit, believing that the Holy Spirit does miracles today, believing
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   that the gifts of the Holy Spirit described in 1 Corinthians 12 are still active today,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   that kind of people are at the cutting edge of the growth of Christianity around the world.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   Now, my caution would be this, mingled with Pentecostalism in many places is a prosperity
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.960]   gospel, a prosperity preaching that identifies Christianity with "things will go better for
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   you, you won't suffer when you're a farmer, your crops will prosper, your wife will never
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920]   miscarry, your pigs will have eight little piglets and never lose the piglets, everything
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.160]   will go better for you if you follow Jesus."
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.480]   That's not true.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.360]   And that kind of prosperity preaching is hurting the church, and so to the degree that Pentecostalism
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.140]   is associated with prosperity preaching, I've got concerns.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.520]   And the next question, which was not entirely related, but it's worth publishing and putting
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.120]   out there, it was a question about how and why Pastor John corrects or debates people
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.640]   on issues of disagreement or concern, specifically regarding his conversation with Rick Warren.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   Here's what Pastor John told the audience in Italy.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.000]   I think it's absolutely crucial when someone has great influence and you have a sense that
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.560]   some of that influence may be negative, that instead of just talking about the person,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   you should talk to the person.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.600]   So I want to write to people or talk to people who I think are negative, unless they have
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.280]   written books that are out there in the public and you can talk about the book.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.320]   You don't have to call everybody on the telephone who's written a book.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.800]   I mean, I've written books.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.880]   I don't expect people who disagree with me, I don't expect them to call me on the telephone
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   first.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.440]   I have a right to disagree with John Piper, put it in writing, put it on the internet,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   disagree with me.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   And I feel the same.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.800]   But if you know somebody, so we were talking about Rick Warren.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.320]   I love Rick Warren.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   Rick Warren is one of the most influential pastors in the world.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.800]   He's written the book that has sold more than any other Christian book outside the Bible
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.240]   and maybe one or two others.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.120]   And I think it's a good book, by the way.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.480]   But I call Rick up.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.840]   In fact, I asked him to come speak at our conference and it was very controversial.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.240]   Why are you having Rick Warren come to your conference?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.160]   Because you two guys aren't the same.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.600]   And I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   So I called him.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.280]   I said, "Can I come and interview you for 90 minutes?"
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.840]   And we sat at a table just like this.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.520]   And for 90 minutes, you can see it online.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.360]   You can go there and type it in.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.200]   And I just, I gave him every hard question I could think about theologically, because
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.440]   I want to know, are you teaching something essentially different?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.160]   We are different, very different.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.000]   He's much more pragmatic than I am.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.440]   I'm much more theologically oriented than he is.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.760]   And I said to him at the end of our conversation, which turned up the fact that we didn't disagree
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.360]   on essential theological matters.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   The disagreement is method and emphasis.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.880]   And I suggested to Rick, and he could listen to this and I wouldn't be ashamed.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.240]   I suggested, "You know, I think if you spent the last decade or two of your life being
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.320]   more doctrinal, more theological, your impact would be deeper and longer."
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.120]   And I don't know that he, I don't think he agreed with me, but my willingness to say
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.520]   that to him in person and in public is I think significant.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.040]   So I think leaders ought to do that for each other.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.640]   We should confront one another when we have disagreements.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.880]   Yeah, so good.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.680]   This was a field recording captured during John Piper's television interview in Monticellano,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.160]   Italy, recorded on June 3rd during his recent international trip.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.680]   Piper was there for the International Ministries' Congresso Missione 2016 conference, and he
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.800]   was being interviewed by Alessandro Iovino.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.760]   Little clips like this remind us of the vast reach of the web and of course Desiring God
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.320]   content around the world.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   Our internet distribution strategy allows people from every nation to access our content, mobile
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.000]   apps free of charge.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.640]   And Desiring God and this podcast is supported almost entirely by the generosity of our donors
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.080]   around the world who make this international work possible.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840]   So thank you for your generosity that makes it all possible.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   Well if all of us, every single human being on the planet, if we're all descendants of
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.280]   Adam and Eve or even we could say of Noah, where did all the unique races on the planet
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.040]   originate?
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   Such a good question, and that is tomorrow on the podcast.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author, theologian,
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.760]   and pastor John Piper.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.720]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you tomorrow.
