[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Do you think one day technology will allow individual human beings to become immortal
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.520]   besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.440]   Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence will give us the key to genetic immortality.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   You see, in the coming decades, everyone's going to have their gene sequenced.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.040]   We'll have billions of genomes of old people, billions of genomes of young people.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.480]   And what are we going to do with it?
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.240]   We're going to run it through an AI machine, which has pattern recognition, to look for
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.360]   the age genes.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.200]   In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors, kings, and queens lusted over, the
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.800]   fountain of youth will be found by artificial intelligence.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.600]   Artificial intelligence will identify where these age genes are located.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.080]   First of all, what is aging?
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.520]   We now know what aging is.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.000]   Aging is the buildup of errors.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.880]   That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.240]   This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish, and they go into senescence, and
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.240]   they die.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.000]   In fact, that's why we die.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We die because of the buildup of mistakes in our genome, in our cellular activity.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.800]   But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes with CRISPR-type technologies,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.680]   and perhaps even live forever.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.560]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560]   Where does aging take place in a car?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920]   Given a car, where does aging take place?
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.680]   Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.120]   A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.160]   B, that's where you have combustion.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.060]   The mitochondria.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.480]   We now know where aging takes place.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.320]   And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up in the mitochondria of the cell, we could
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.640]   become immortal.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal, would you?
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   Damn straight.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.120]   No, I think about it for a while, because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.800]   You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   It turns out that years ago, in the Greeks mythology, there was the saga of Tithonus
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   and Aurora.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.400]   Aurora was the goddess of the dawn, and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.680]   Tithonus.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:41.560]   And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her the gift of immortality to give to her lover.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.760]   But you see, Aurora made a mistake, a huge mistake.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.440]   She asked for immortality, but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.800]   So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year, decrepit, a bag of bones, but
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.000]   he could never die.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Never die.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   Quality of life is important.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.400]   So I think immortality is a great idea, as long as you also have immortal youth as well.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.760]   Now I personally believe, and I cannot prove this, but I personally believe that our grandkids
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.460]   may have the option of reaching the age of 30 and then stopping.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.760]   They may like being age 30, because you have wisdom, you have all the benefits of age and
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   maturity, and you still live forever with a healthy body.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.880]   Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.
