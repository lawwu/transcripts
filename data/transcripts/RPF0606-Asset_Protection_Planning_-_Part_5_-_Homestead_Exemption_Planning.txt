And you can go back and have the political argument on whether that's right or wrong. But the point is today in the United States, you can never actually own your property. You'll always be required to pay property taxes. And if you don't pay those property taxes, your local government can place a lien on your property. Now usually they can't force the
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.140]   the property. Now usually they can't force the

[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.820]   Well, they now know that there's a lot of money available for them in that asset.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.320]   The same thing applies if you had an older mortgage.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:26:00.020]   You took out a mortgage 20 years ago, well anybody can sit down and run an amortization schedule and have a guess of how much money is in that asset.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.060]   So, if your mortgage is 20 years old and you took it out with a beginning value of $20000, they can see that today the taxable value of your house is $450, and now the mortgage has been paid down to probably $500. Well, now in this case, they know, "Hey, if the lawsuit comes against you, there's a good chance they're going to be going for about $400
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.060]  . It's as simple as that. And all of that information, because it's all public record, is available to any person,

[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.560]   I'm going to go ahead and talk about the legal counsel.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:38.500]   One of the most important things to do is always to consult legal counsel on this type of discussion. And it's much easier for you to spend a few hundred dollars down at the local bankruptcy attorney's office, where they live and breathe this stuff every day and they can point out all the exemptions to you. It's much easier for you to do that than it is to get it wrong. So go and consult a planner in your state and find out what the appropriate situations are for your state.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:08.520]   The next episode in this series, we talk about pensions and retirement plans and exemption planning for those assets. I hope you'll stay tuned for that in another series. As I close, I want to continue to market to you my credit card course. And I want to point out to you that one of the most valuable things about that is in the credit card course, I do a serious deep dive into the strategies that you can use when taking on debt to provide you with the best possible financial assistance.

[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.540]   Well, the problem is if you go to your house and you take a lot of money and you're not going to take a lot of money, you're not going to take a lot of money, you're not going to take a lot of money.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:33:08.560]   to pay your attorney. Well, now you, especially if you live in a state with good homestead laws, now you run a problem. As a fleurty and I'd never take money out of my house to go and pay an attorney because if the attorney loses. If I don't pay, I'm going to have the attorney to sue me of course, but if the attorney loses, then now all the sudden I'm out because the attorney is going to require their money up front for them to take the case. I'm not going to get that money back unless we can get the opponent to win the legal fees and the legal fees and the other.
