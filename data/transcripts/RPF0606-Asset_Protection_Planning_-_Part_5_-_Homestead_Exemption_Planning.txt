[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.480]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. In today's episode, we continue
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.480]   our series on asset protection planning. My hope is to help you protect the assets that you currently
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   have and those assets that you are currently accumulating while you're on your path toward
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640]   financial independence. In the early episodes of this series, we tackled a lot of big picture
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.840]   topics. We tackled a lot of theory, a little bit of philosophy, and some big picture understanding
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.840]   of how the litigation risk works against you. In today's episode, we're going to get very tactical
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   because I want to provide information that will help you where you are now. The good news is this,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.920]   you don't need to hire an attorney to engage in asset protection planning. There are many
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.440]   forms of asset protection planning that you can do entirely on your own. And in fact,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.880]   almost everything in today's show will be entirely accessible to you without ever hiring legal
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.840]   counsel. You don't need exotic strategies that cost a lot of money necessarily. You can do a lot
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.800]   with simple practical things that you're already doing by simply understanding those things.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.080]   So today we're going to start the process of specific tactical advice that you can put into
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.880]   place in your own life to protect the assets that you currently have. You don't have to be a
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.240]   millionaire. You just need to listen and start to think about how you can put things in place.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.520]   Now, in asset protection planning, there are a number of different categories or rubrics that
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   different planners use to organize their strategies. I will touch on some of those in
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.640]   shows to come, but today I'm going to use the categories that come from a wonderful book for
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   financial advisors called Asset Protection in Financially Unsafe Times by Ryan Fowler and
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   Arnold Goldstein. And in this book, in the introduction, these authors start by categorizing
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.520]   asset protection planning in two different ways. First, they lay out three core strategies
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   relating to asset protection ideas. And those strategies are number one, exemption planning.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.280]   Number two, asset titling, making sure that all of your assets are titled to a protective entity.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.240]   And then number three, encumbering your assets or equity stripping your assets in order to reduce
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.840]   their economic value and/or the ability of a creditor to attach those assets. And so I'm going
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   to begin by using their categorizations to lay out for you some basic ideas that you can put in
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.920]   place. Today's episode focused on exemption planning. An additional scheme of categorization
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   that they touch on is the use of what are called transfer-based asset protection strategies
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   or transformational asset protection strategies. The idea behind a transfer-based asset protection
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.000]   strategy is that you can transfer an asset out of a creditor's reach by moving it from one place
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.920]   to another. The idea of a transformational asset protection strategy is that you can transform
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.360]   an asset into something that a creditor can't get or wouldn't want. So the examples that are
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   easiest to consider, a transfer-based strategy could be simply you're taking money from your
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.320]   bank account and investing it into your 401(k). So thus you've taken, or from your salary, I guess
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   would be more appropriate, you take some of your money from your salary, instead of letting it hit
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.520]   your bank account, you put it in your 401(k). You've transferred that asset into something that
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.320]   a creditor can't get. The 401(k) asset is outside of most creditors reach. Or you can transform an
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   asset. So if you have money in your bank account, you can use that money to prepay a lease on an
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.320]   apartment or a commercial building. And thus you've changed the money that was easily available in
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.080]   your bank account into something that's useful to you, but it's probably not useful to your creditor.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.480]   You can prepay a five-year lease and that may be very helpful to you and your business,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.320]   but your creditor is probably not that interested in coming in and taking over that lease, even if
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.600]   they can get legal title to it. And so those are two more methods of categorization that we want
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.520]   to keep in mind. Let's dig into exemption planning, because of any asset protection strategy that's
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.800]   available to all people, I think exemption planning is the most straightforward and it is the
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   simplest and easiest thing for people to understand. Exemption planning is simply the process
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   of organizing your wealth so that it is protected by the current law from a creditor's ability to
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.120]   take it, from creditor attachment, even though you still own it. The form of exemption planning
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.800]   that is available to you will vary largely depending on your state. Some exemptions come
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.480]   from federal law, but most exemptions are governed by the individual laws of your state.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.960]   Now, the most commonly known examples of exemption planning would be things like the house that you
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.800]   own, your homestead. Depending on the state that you live in, your homestead will be protected to
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   some degree by the actual laws of your state. Now, where I live here in Florida, Florida has
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   extremely generous homestead protection laws. And in fact, there is an unlimited value of your
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   personal homestead, the actual property that you live in, there's an unlimited value or equity
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.760]   that's protected from the claims of a creditor. Now, there are a couple of rules such as your
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   homestead can't, if you live inside of a city, your homestead can't exceed half an acre in size
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.720]   if you're inside of a municipality, or if you're outside of a municipality, your homestead can't
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.320]   exceed 160 acres. So you have to have a house that fits in under those categories. But as long as you
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.760]   file a homestead declaration, as long as you live there and own, and that's your homestead, you can
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.440]   protect an unlimited value of property. There are a few other states, notably Texas, and then there
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   are a couple of Midwestern states, I think Kansas and Iowa have very generous homestead exemptions,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.800]   but most states don't provide such a generous homestead exemption, but Florida does. And that's
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.440]   just an example to show you how the actual state that you live in will govern what you are entitled
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:39.680]   to. Another example of an exemption that you should plan for is the protection of your pension
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.960]   and retirement plans, especially those that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.880]   Security Act, ERISA legislation. This is most pension plans, what are called qualified plans,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   including traditional pensions, or also including things like a 401k account, are governed by ERISA.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.880]   And as such, they are governed by the federal law, which makes those plans completely
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.160]   protected from the claims of a creditor who will sue you. The other prominent examples
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.040]   would include life insurance, especially life insurance cash surrender values,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.000]   although life insurance death benefits are also protected depending on the situation.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.240]   One of the benefits of Florida law is that life insurance cash values are protected to an
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.840]   unlimited amount, cash surrender values. And so life insurance is a very valuable asset as our
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   annuity contracts here in Florida. Your state may vary, your state may differ. There may be
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.280]   restrictions in your state where only a few thousand dollars of life insurance cash surrender
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.920]   values are protected. And so you need to look at the specifics for your state. Annuities are also
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.240]   falling into that method of protection. Annuity contracts can be very valuable to protect yourself
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.920]   from the claims of creditors. And then you can also look at specific items. So each state,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.160]   and here what you want to do is you want to look at each state's bankruptcy exemptions.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   Each state will have different items that can be protected by the bankruptcy code in that state.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.360]   Some states have adopted the federal bankruptcy code exemptions and some states have created
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.560]   their own. And depending on the state, different items or amounts of personal property will be
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.120]   protected. Some states have fairly generous amounts and some states don't. So in Florida,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.600]   Florida exemption amounts for personal property are fairly limited. For example,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.680]   if you claim a homestead exemption in Florida, you can only exempt in bankruptcy filings up to
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   a thousand dollars of personal property. Of course, that can double if you're a husband and wife,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.520]   or up to $4,000 if you're not claiming a homestead exemption. Florida doesn't protect tools of the
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.400]   trade. Many states protect tools of the trade to very high value amounts, which can be very
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.480]   important for you if you work in a trade where you have expensive tools that you've accumulated
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.880]   that have a large value. And instead of having to see those tools sold at auction in order to
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.360]   satisfy your creditors, you can protect those in certain states. And so we'll go through that in a
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   moment. And then also wages, you want to consider how wages are protected. Many times if a garnishment
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.560]   is issued against your wages, that garnishment can be very hurtful to you and your ability to
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.800]   provide for those that are dependent upon your income. It can be very difficult and hurtful for
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:26.160]   you to be able to rebuild your financial base. And so you might want to consider moving to a state
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.040]   that protects wages from wage garnishment. Also, then, of course, there are many kinds of public
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.960]   benefits, such as public assistance or Social Security payments or veterans benefits or workers
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.160]   compensation, and these are governed differently. Now, in planning your exemption amounts, you
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.640]   should be aware of the interplay between potential creditors and creditor attachment in a lawsuit
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.600]   and bankruptcy exemptions. The most reliable, the best place for you to start if you're ever
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.840]   researching the subject for yourself is to look up your state's bankruptcy laws and your state's
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.520]   bankruptcy exemptions, because there will often be a good, strong connection between that and what a
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.800]   creditor would be legally entitled to be able to take from you. There are differences, for example,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   in Florida, there are certain laws related to bankruptcy of how long you have to have lived
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.720]   in a place. If you're going to file for that unlimited homestead exemption amount, you need
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.200]   to have lived in the property for at least a few years, something like a thousand days. And there
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.040]   are a couple of different numbers that you would need to check on. So all of these things are
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.360]   based upon the specific state that you live in. But when you sit down and you look at your balance
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.240]   sheet, one of the most valuable things you can do in terms of protecting your assets is to try to
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.720]   make sure that you maximize the exemptions that are available to you. When it comes to asset
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:00.560]   protection planning, you have the fewest problems to look out for when it comes to simple exemption
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.880]   planning. What do I mean? Well, first, you need to make sure that any time you engage in asset
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.480]   protection planning, that you're always doing something for a reason that's not exclusively
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.040]   asset protection planning. You should always imagine yourself standing in a courtroom,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.160]   facing an antagonistic creditor, and the judge looking over your debtor statement,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.120]   the statement of accounts that you've submitted after a judgment has been issued against you,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.040]   where you've listed out every asset that you own. And the judge is sitting there looking at your
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.000]   assets and asking you, "Why did you put this money here?" You always need to have a good
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.680]   answer for that. And a good answer does not involve, "Well, judge, I put it there so my
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.880]   creditors couldn't get there." Now, we all know that that's one benefit, but that should not be
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.360]   your only benefit. So the reason that you buy a house and pay down your mortgage is not to protect
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.480]   your claims from creditors. The reason that you buy a house and pay down your mortgage is because
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.600]   you need a place to live, and it's a prudent thing to do to pay down your mortgage. The reason that
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   you buy a life insurance policy is not to protect your cash surrender values from the claims of
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.480]   creditors. The reason you buy a life insurance policy is to provide income for your family
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.200]   and to make sure that you have invested well and have a safe asset. The reason that you put your
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.040]   money in a 401(k) is not to protect your money from creditors. The reason that you put your
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   money in a 401(k) is to provide for your retirement. And that's the way that the law
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.520]   works as well. The law is intended to protect those things that are needed in the long run.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.080]   So for example, why are Social Security benefits exempt from the claims of creditors? Well,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.880]   because the understanding is those Social Security benefits are protecting poor people.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.720]   And so as a last line of defense against poverty, if a creditor can now come in and take those,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.960]   then the government has a whole bigger problem on their hands where the poor people they thought
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.880]   that they were providing for by providing Social Security benefits, now they have an additional
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.440]   problem. And now the government is the one bailing out the creditor. So the reason that
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.120]   disability benefits or Social Security benefits or Veterans Administration's benefits or unemployment
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.320]   compensation is protected from creditors is so that the government doesn't have more problems,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.240]   they don't have more broke homeless people living on the street. So that's the basic mentality that
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.400]   flows through this. And so you need to understand that and be able to articulate non-asset protection
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.040]   planning reasons for all the things that you do. This is especially important when you get into the
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.920]   more exotic world of asset protection planning, especially planning that involves offshore trusts
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.960]   or offshore investment products. If you're going to stand in front of a judge and he's asking you,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   "Why did you move this money over into this offshore trust where the trust document
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.120]   specifically states that your trustee must not turn over the funds to creditors?"
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.960]   You need an investment reason. "Well, judge, I was able to access better investment products,"
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.880]   or something like, "Well, judge, I wanted to buy a life insurance policy from Lichtenstein,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.800]   and in so doing, they wouldn't sell it to me if I was a US citizen, so I had to put the policy
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   into a trust so that they would actually take out the policy." Now you have an appropriate reason
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.680]   for your actions. So think in advance about this and be very cautious about ever saying or implying
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:28.160]   that you're doing asset protection planning. It should be an important first step. And with regard
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.280]   to exemption planning, this is the easiest thing for you to do. Let's begin with homestead
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.160]   exemptions. Look up the laws in your state relating to the exemption of your homestead,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.040]   the place where you live, and its protection from the state of creditors. The first thing that you
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.880]   want to look for is the amount of your home's value that would be protected from a creditor.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.960]   The amount of your home's value that would be protected in bankruptcy court is your best place
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:07.680]   to start. Now, if you live in Florida, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, and there's one other state,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.480]   I think Oklahoma, if you live in one of these states where all of your value is, all of the
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.400]   equity in your homestead is protected, then you should know that. If you live in a state where
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.920]   less value of your house is protected, then you need to know that as well. And this will drive
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.040]   some of your decisions. Some, not necessarily all, but it will drive some of your decisions.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:37.440]   It'll drive a decision such as paying off a house. If you live in Texas, it's very much going to be
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:45.520]   in your best interest of protecting your assets to pay off your Texas house. Now, if you live in a
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.920]   state like North Carolina, where less than $20,000 of your equity is protected, then now you're going
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.880]   to have a more questionable decision. Do you really want to expose $300,000 of equity to the
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.240]   potential claims of a creditor? If you have a paid off, you live in a $300,000 house that's paid off,
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.920]   if a creditor sues you and you're ordered to pay them the amount of money that they owe,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.440]   they can force your home to be foreclosed. And yes, you'll get $20,000 back after the sale,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.160]   but they'll receive the rest of the asset. So you have to look at it and you have to balance
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.600]   the cost of having that equity pulled out in some other way, such as the cost of carrying a mortgage,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.280]   the benefits of carrying a mortgage, et cetera. And in this constant challenging decision that we
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.920]   face of carrying debt versus not carrying debt, doing it safely, et cetera, one of the things that
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.160]   comes into play is asset protection planning. And you need to consider the amounts. So look at the
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.680]   amount of equity that is protected. The second thing that you need to look at is the exceptions
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:17:00.880]   to the exemption. For example, obviously having a paid off house does not protect all of the equity.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.600]   The most common example would be property taxes or liens that would be filed on your home by,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.920]   it could include mechanics liens if you're hiring workers to work on your property,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.720]   but even by your local government. I got into a scrap with my local government here in Florida
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.480]   because I had chickens. And one of the things that they threatened me with, if I didn't get
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.800]   rid of my chickens, was that they were going to lien my property by $1,000 a day until I got rid
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.280]   of my chickens. Now, this is one of the things that really changed my outlook on financial
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   planning because I'd always had this idea that, yes, in the United States of America, you can own
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.920]   your house, you can own your property. And I had this somewhat naive understanding of that. I had
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.880]   this idea that protection of property, that's the American way, blah, blah, blah. I didn't understand
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.680]   how naive that was. That was stupid and naive of me. Now, there are still countries in the world
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   that do actually protect your property. There are countries in the world that don't
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.640]   charge property taxes. And you can go back and have the political argument on whether that's
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   right or wrong. But the point is today in the United States, you can never actually own your
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.440]   property. You'll always be required to pay property taxes. And if you don't pay those property taxes,
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   your local government can place a lien on your property. Now, usually they can't force the sale
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.760]   of your property for taxes, although sometimes they can, but those taxes will arise in tax liens.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:29.120]   And if at some point in time you want to transfer the property, then you wind up not being able to
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.920]   transfer it without satisfying those liens. This applies to things like fines. And so the situation
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.080]   I was in was when I'm sitting there dealing with the government, I'm looking down and it wasn't
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.680]   just chickens. The most frustrating one was that there was a 35-year-old shed on my property that
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.760]   was an unpermitted shed built without permit at the time. And there was no way to bring the shed
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.120]   into compliance because it was six inches over the setback from the property line and 12 inches
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.320]   too tall. That's the short version of the story. It was very frustrating. But it was big, beautiful,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   valuable shed. And I'm sitting here saying, "Wait a second. I put a lot of money into this property.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.720]   I have a lot of equity. And now I'm in a scrap with the local government that basically has
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.960]   unlimited power to steal that equity from me by leaning my property." So you need to know that.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.800]   Because even though your property might be exempt from the claims of, say, a credit card company
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.080]   that sues you for nonpayment, you're not going to be exempt from the claims of a local government,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.120]   a lien that arises from your property taxes. Obviously also, you're not going to be protected,
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.440]   the equity in your property is not going to be protected if somebody forecloses on you because
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.240]   you don't pay your mortgage. You go out and you purchase a $500,000 property. You put a down
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.800]   payment of $300,000 because you're interested in protecting your $300,000 of equity, but you
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.600]   take out a mortgage of $200,000. Something happens, you can't pay that mortgage. That
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.720]   mortgage company can force the sale of your property at foreclosure auction. And after
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.360]   they've satisfied their lien, they'll give you the rest of the proceeds. But you may very well kiss
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.240]   off $150,000 of equity goodbye because that was the discount from the sale of your property at
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.280]   foreclosure auction. Other things like other asset protection planning, such as divorce.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.600]   There's nothing that would require that your property cannot be issued to the spouse that
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.840]   you're being divorced from. 50% of the equity in your property can be assigned regardless
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   of your ownership of it. So just because you come in and you own the property and you don't have a
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.760]   mortgage on it doesn't mean that that property is perfectly asset protected. And so you need
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.320]   to understand the fine print on or the details, the exceptions, and make sure that your personal
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:47.360]   situation is protected from those exceptions. Check very carefully for any requirements that
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.840]   are unique to your state or your locality. Some states require you to file certain forms,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:00.160]   such as a declaration of homestead or domicile. Some states require that you live in the house
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.440]   a certain amount of time. Some states are very careful about titling. One of the biggest concerns
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:14.240]   that I've always had living in Florida is the titling of a home in personal name or in a trust.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.000]   So generally, you would, for the purpose of estate planning and smooth, easy flowing of an estate,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.080]   generally you would want your asset to be titled in a trust. However, if you title your asset in
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   a trust, you lose the ability to title the asset in the ownership of tenancy by the entireties.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.680]   One of the most, one of the other best forms of exemption planning is adjusting the ownership
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.880]   of assets, making sure that you own assets in a way that they're protected. So generally,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.120]   for example, you want to think about if you have a large risk, a large liability exposure,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.520]   then you would usually want to make sure that your assets are titled to your spouse who doesn't have
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:00.240]   such a large liability exposure. And we'll talk about that. If your state allows titling of assets
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.680]   and tenancy by the entireties, you want to make sure that you title your assets and tenancy by
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.320]   the entireties so that you each own an equal undivided interest in the property so that your
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:13.520]   interest can't be sold, much superior to tenants in common where your interest can then be sold
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.840]   out from under you even though you have a joint ownership situation. But one of the challenges in
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.520]   Florida has been understanding, well, wait a second, if I put this asset into a trust,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.200]   am I still protected by the home Florida bankruptcy laws? Now, I need to verify the answer
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.440]   to that. A few years ago, it was unclear. I need to ask a buddy of mine who's an attorney because
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.600]   he told me that that was changing, that finally there was some case law on that situation. But
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:44.320]   that's the kind of thing that you need to look out for very, very carefully. So think through
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   those details when it comes to your home. Give very careful attention to the financial
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.960]   considerations of your house. And there are a few reasons why. Number one, your house is an
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:08.000]   extremely public asset. When you purchase your house, your purchase, you'll be recorded as the
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.240]   owner. The title will be recorded in the local courthouse and in the system as you are the owner
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.600]   of that house. Now, as many of our municipalities go to put the records online, used to be the
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.760]   private investigator who was looking into information on your house had to go down and
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.800]   look it up in the actual physical courthouse. Today, most of it is online. And so a simple
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:37.120]   search, even a wildcard search on your county's court records will usually pop up the house that
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.200]   you live in. If your name is John Smith, maybe you're good because you're protected. They need
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   a little bit more. But if your name is Terrianna Hodgkinson, a quick search of Hodgkinson is going
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   to pull up your residence and there aren't going to be too many other people named Terrianna
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:59.040]   Hodgkinson. So in that example, that asset is going to be exposed. Now, remember, that asset
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.560]   is also basically marked to market just about every year in terms of a property value. And so
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.080]   somebody can quickly look down and say, "Oh, it's a hundred thousand dollar house because that's the
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.560]   taxable value." Or, "Hey, it's a million dollar house and that's the taxable value." So not only
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   does this make a major problem with regard to your personal privacy, but this creates a very
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:25.760]   public asset. And because generally you're going to be trying to take advantage of filing the
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.920]   property as your homestead to receive your tax savings and a homestead exemption, because you're
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.440]   going to be trying to take advantage of those asset protection laws that do apply to your
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.360]   homestead, you're probably going to be filed in your own personal name. It's probably not going
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.760]   to be filed in a trust, which would give you an additional level of privacy. So this is a very
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.040]   public asset. And what's worse is the liens that are recorded against that asset are also public.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   So now the next step is somebody will look and say, "Is there a mortgage on this property?" And
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   they can quickly and easily look and find that either, "Hey, there is a mortgage," or, "There's
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.960]   no mortgage recorded. So-and-so paid cash for the house." Well, now what? Now they know if there's
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.800]   no mortgage or other lien recorded in the courthouse, now somebody knows that the full
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.840]   equity value of your house, that you own the whole thing. And so in doing a financial asset
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.240]   investigation on your case, an investigator has a lot of information right there, very simple and
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.040]   right at their fingertips to understand your situation. If you live in a state that only
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.520]   gives you $20,000 of protection on the equity of your house, well, they now know that there's a lot
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:36.720]   of money available for them in that asset. The same thing applies if you had an older mortgage.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.440]   You took out a mortgage 20 years ago. Well, anybody can sit down and run an amortization
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:47.040]   schedule and have a guess of how much money is owed on that mortgage. If your mortgage is 20
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.080]   years old and you took it out with a beginning value of $200,000, they can see that today the
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:59.840]   taxable value of your house is $450,000. And now the mortgage has been paid down to probably $50,000.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.760]   Well, now in this case, they know, "Hey, if the lawsuit comes against you, there's a good chance
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.680]   they're going to be going for about $400,000." It's as simple as that. And all of that information,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.880]   because it's all public record, is available to any person with the ability to go down to the
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.160]   courthouse and spend about 15 minutes there checking the books or the ability to go on the
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.840]   website and check the information that's there on the website. So your home is a huge potential
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   problem. Now, if you're in one of those states, such as Florida or Texas or Kansas, okay, a little
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:43.680]   bit better than even if your home information is public, then you're protected because of those
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.280]   states. But if you're not in one of those handful of states, this is a potentially a huge problem.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.400]   And this is the type of analysis that can more easily go back to analysis of your renting versus
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.840]   owning, especially if there is a high potential liability in your situation. Should you rent or
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.560]   should you own? Well, if your ownership is going to be a matter of public record, if your ownership
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:16.400]   is going to not be protected, and if the financial calculations of rent versus own are comparable,
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   this situation, now you have many more compelling reasons to rent. Put more money in your 401(k),
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.440]   which is more privately protected from the claims of creditors or from their ability to see it,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   in any case, the basic people who could see your 401(k) are going to be the federal government
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.520]   based upon the reports that are filed with them, the people who work at the 401(k) institution,
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.040]   but are likely not going to be the private investigator or the local attorney. And so
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.840]   put more money in your 401(k) and just rent. And then if you want to buy property, consider buying
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.280]   property that's paid for rental property, which you can title into a trust, which will give you
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.960]   more privacy. And you can also have some protection depending on what asset form you use for it. And
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:08.640]   you can protect that asset based upon the ownership entity. Possibly you can even do it abroad where
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.440]   now you get even more protection. So there are a lot of different ways to do it. But this is the
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:20.320]   type of analysis that you will need to do based upon the state that you live in. Now, in conclusion
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.680]   on Homestead exemptions, I would be remiss if I did not point out to you that you should always
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:32.880]   have a plan B. Now, I believe in your having a plan B, a plan C, a plan D, going all the way to
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:41.040]   Z. And then I like the ideas of having plans AB, AC, AD, etc. Multiple plans. And you should be
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   aware of the fact that one of your kind of last ditch efforts, if you've done no asset protection
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.880]   planning and you're facing a severe claim, you should be willing to consider moving to Florida
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.720]   and purchasing a homestead in Florida. To my knowledge, Florida is the only state where the
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.920]   Florida Supreme Court has affirmed that the purchase of a homestead in Florida, even if it's
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:09.280]   intentionally done to thwart creditors, cannot be undone as a fraudulent transfer. Remember back to
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.720]   that pesky fraudulent transfer law. Many things that you would do in a difficult situation can
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.320]   and will be undone by a court as fraudulent transfers if you didn't do the planning prior
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:28.160]   to the facts that occurred came up. But one of the few things is move to Florida and purchase a
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.960]   home. Now, the good thing about that, depending on the amount of money that you have to spend,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.720]   you can find in the state of Florida a homestead that you could purchase for anywhere from a few
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.760]   tens of thousands of dollars to many tens of millions of dollars. And you should always have
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:50.160]   that and be aware of that and consider that as a potential backup plan. There are some more details,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.920]   two things that you would need to know, and that won't protect you from bankruptcy,
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.480]   but it can protect your asset from the claims of creditors. So if you're in a situation like that,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.840]   always keep in mind, Florida is there. It's an easy car ride from most of the country,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:12.080]   and it's a very large state with many diverse cultures, many diverse places, many diverse
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.480]   business opportunities as well. And one of the benefits of Florida, which we'll talk about in
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.440]   a separate show, is creditor wage garnishment exemptions. If you're the file taxes as the head
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   of a household in Florida, you have additional protection from the garnishment of your wages,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   which can be very helpful if you are a wage earner. I'm going to wrap up this show on
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.720]   exemptions here with that discussion of the homestead exemption. I repeat, check your state
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.400]   laws. This is state law territory, and I will use Florida again and again simply because it's the
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.600]   state I'm familiar with. I wouldn't presume to talk to you about Nebraska state laws, or I
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.680]   wouldn't presume to talk to you about Maine. You need to check those things. If in doubt, speak
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.400]   with an attorney in your area. One of the most important things to do is always to consult legal
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.240]   counsel on this type of discussion. And it's much easier for you to spend a few hundred dollars
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.600]   down at the local bankruptcy attorney's office where they live and breathe this stuff every day,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.640]   and they can point out all the exemptions to you. It's much easier for you to do that than it is
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:25.840]   to get it wrong. So go and consult a planner in your state and find out what the appropriate
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   situations are for your state. The next episode in this series, we talk about pensions and
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.680]   retirement plans and exemption planning for those assets. So I hope you'll stay tuned for that in
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.280]   another series. As I close, I want to continue to market to you my credit card course. And I want
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.400]   to point out to you that one of the most valuable things about that is in the credit card course,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:53.520]   I do a serious deep dive into the strategies that you can use when taking on debt to protect
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:01.040]   yourself. And this is a good example of why that's so important. Let's pretend that you just got
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.880]   noticed that you're going to be served with a lawsuit and you need to fight that lawsuit.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.640]   And the problem is you have been investing a lot of money in your business and you have a house,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.320]   but you know you need to fight this lawsuit and you don't have a lot of ready cash right now.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.800]   So what do you do if you're in that situation? Well, the problem is if you go to your house
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   and you take out a home equity line to pay your attorney, well, now you, especially if you live
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.120]   in a state with good homestead laws, now you run a problem. As a Floridian, I'd never take money out
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.400]   of my house to go and pay an attorney because if the attorney loses, not only if I don't pay,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.360]   I'm going to have the attorney sue me, of course, but if the attorney loses, then now all of a
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.960]   sudden I'm out because the attorney is going to require their money up front for them to take the
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.200]   case. I'm not going to get that money back unless we can get the opponent to win the legal fees and
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   a victory on our side. But now I've lost that asset of the house. Well, I could take out a 401(k)
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.160]   loan if I have a 401(k), but I'm not about to do that because now that puts 401(k) money at risk.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.760]   So where am I going to get the money? I don't have the money in savings right now because it's all
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.400]   out in investment right now. Well, if I've got an asset I could sell, then I want to sell that asset,
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.800]   but I don't want to fire sale the asset. Let's say I've got a rental property and I look at it and
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.320]   say, "Hey, this rental property, I wouldn't mind being divested of it for investment reasons,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.760]   but I don't want to fire sale it. I don't want to become a motivated seller." But the attorney's
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.560]   saying, "Hey, Joshua, if I'm going to fight this case for you, I need some money." Where would I
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:38.720]   turn? Credit cards. Credit cards are a beautiful answer to this problem because if I have a good
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.640]   credit score, and especially if I've developed extensive lines of credit that are available to
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:53.120]   me, I can access that line of credit fast and I can access it cheap. I can use that money to go
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:00.240]   and pay my attorney so that the attorney will fight my case for me. If I win the lawsuit and
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.280]   if I can get the opposing party to pay my reimburse me for my legal fees, now I can reimburse myself
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:14.640]   for that loan, that credit card loan. If I lose the lawsuit, then I can go ahead and work through
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.360]   and sell my rental property at a higher rate, buy myself more time, and I can take those proceeds
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:25.680]   and pay off my credit cards. If I really lose the lawsuit and I wind up just sunk, well,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.440]   I may have to go through bankruptcy court, and at least there I can discharge the credit card debt
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.040]   while still keeping my house and my 401(k) while also keeping those proceeds protected from the
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.680]   claims of creditors. And so that's why understanding the secured and unsecured nature of debts is so
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:48.480]   important. But the only way that situation works is if I've done the advanced planning. First of
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   all, if I understand what that plan XYZ is in that worst case scenario, if I've thought about
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.280]   which assets I would sell, where I would get the forms of financing, if I have a high credit score,
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   and if I have extensive lines of credit available to me. Credit cards are low-hanging fruit if you
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.320]   understand how they can be used strategically. If you have credit card debt, my course will help
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.680]   you get out of debt faster and cheaper. If you don't have credit card debt, my course will help
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.080]   you make sure that if you ever do have credit card debt for a scenario like I've just described,
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.840]   that you're at least protected so that you can keep your business going, so that you can keep
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.360]   your life going, so that you can keep your family intact in order for you to earn the money,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   liquidate the assets, whatever you need to pay off the debt. The point is not to escape creditors.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.800]   I don't ever want to help you do that necessarily, like in the sense of a fraudulent intent. I'm
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   sure somebody will do it. I can't stop that. But I don't want to help you do that. I want to help
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.960]   you protect yourself, keep your life stable, so that with all those things stable, you can solve
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.640]   the problem and move on from a place of security to a place of additional security. I hope you'll
