[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.260]   Most people are operating under the assumption
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.580]   that eating saturated fat is bad
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.100]   and you only do it insofar as you want to taste it.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.260]   And then of course there's a small group of people
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.720]   that love to eat organs and meats
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.060]   and really pack cholesterol
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.100]   and would argue that it doesn't matter
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.580]   if your LDL is 870, it's not gonna impact your health.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.220]   What's the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.940]   saturated fat, at least in your view?
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.860]   - So first let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.060]   just for the listener, 'cause we use them,
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.420]   I don't wanna make sure people understand.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.740]   So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.740]   So it's a ringed molecule.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.320]   God, I used to know exactly what its structure was,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.180]   but it could have 36 carbons for all I remember.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.860]   It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.140]   that is synthesized by every cell in the human body.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.180]   It is so important that without it,
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.860]   if you look at sort of genetic conditions
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700]   that impair cholesterol synthesis,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.420]   depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.900]   So in other words, anything that really interferes
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.580]   with our ability to produce cholesterol
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100]   is a threat to us as a species.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.540]   And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.580]   the cell membrane of every cell in our body.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.120]   So as you know, but maybe the listeners don't,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.340]   even though a cell is a spherical thing,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.060]   it has to be fluid, right?
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.460]   It's not just a rigid sphere, like a blow up ball, right?
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.060]   It's gotta be able to kind of move in this way
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.540]   to mesh with other cells.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.780]   It also has to accommodate having porous structures
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.500]   that traverse its membrane to allow ions
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.820]   and things like that to go across.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.540]   And it's cholesterol that gives the fluidity
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.280]   to that membrane.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.020]   It's also, as you're alluding to,
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.300]   the backbone of some of the most important hormones
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   in our body, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.060]   So we have this thing, super important, okay.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.340]   Then let's talk about, can you get cholesterol in your diet?
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.480]   Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.580]   What was known in 1960,
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.960]   but somehow escaped everybody's imagination
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.900]   until finally the American Heart Association
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.940]   acknowledged this a few years ago,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.060]   is that the cholesterol you eat
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.340]   does not really make it into your body.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.780]   And the reason for that is it's hysterified.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.140]   So we have, and not to get too nerdy,
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.700]   but I think people, I think if,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.100]   I really think it's important people understand
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.940]   how this thing works.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.900]   So we have cells in our gut, and enterocytes,
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.500]   they're the endothelial cells of our gut.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.620]   They have, each one of them has basically
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.820]   two transporters on them.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.980]   So the first is called
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.140]   the Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 Transporter.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.180]   The second is called the ATP Binding Cassette G5/G8.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560]   Okay, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 Transporter
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   will bring in any sterol, cholesterol,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.680]   zoosterol, phytosterol, any sterol
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   that fits through the door will come in.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.380]   Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.600]   that gets taken back to the liver,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.100]   that the liver packages in bile and secretes.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.940]   So that's what aids in our digestion,
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.560]   which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.920]   In addition to using cholesterol
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   for cell membranes and hormones,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.340]   we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.240]   because it's what makes up the bile salts.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.320]   So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.020]   in a pool throughout our body,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.720]   and this is the way it gets back into the body.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's through this Niemann-Pick C1-Like-1 Transporter.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.780]   When it gets in there, the body,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.680]   this is the checkpoint of regulation.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.600]   This is where the body says,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   "Do you have enough cholesterol in the body, yes or no?"
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.280]   If yes, I will let that cholesterol
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.500]   make its way into the circulation.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.200]   So it'll go off the basolateral side of the cell,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.220]   not the luminal side, into the body.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.740]   Alternatively, the body says,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.160]   "You know what, we have enough cholesterol.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.580]   "I'm gonna let you poop this out."
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.180]   And now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.880]   It'll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   So all of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.260]   meaning it doesn't have that big,
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.980]   bulky side chain attached to it.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.580]   The cholesterol you eat is esterified,
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.320]   and an esterified cholesterol molecule
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.080]   simply can't physically pass
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.340]   through that Neiman-Pixey 1-like-1 Transporter.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.340]   Now, we probably manage to de-esterify
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.380]   10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.480]   So in other words, there are small amounts
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.020]   of dietary cholesterol that do make their way
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.920]   into our circulation, but it represents a small fraction
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.300]   of our total body's pool of cholesterol.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.580]   Again, this was known, even by Ancel Keys,
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.660]   the guy who turned fat
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.700]   into the biggest boogeyman of all time.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.880]   Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.160]   Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.240]   Again, it took the American Heart Association
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.520]   another 60 years to figure that out,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.700]   but even now they acknowledge that.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.680]   Dietary cholesterol has no bearing.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.160]   - So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.120]   or at least people who are highly credentialed
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.180]   from good institutions,
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.560]   claiming that eating saturated fat, cheese-
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.520]   - Saturated fat's different.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.760]   - Saturated fat, red meat,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.160]   things that are rich in cholesterol,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.080]   to be more specific, is bad for us
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   in terms of our eventual LDL.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.280]   - So this is two different things.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.800]   So saturated fat consumption in many people
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.000]   will raise LDL cholesterol.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.080]   So it's important to differentiate
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.040]   between the, what is saturated fat?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.000]   So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.080]   just so people understand,
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.720]   totally different molecule from cholesterol.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.080]   Cholesterol has this very complicated ring structure,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.240]   multiple rings stuck together.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.440]   SFA, saturated fat, is just a long-chain fatty acid
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.300]   that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.240]   and it can exist in isolation,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   it can exist in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.280]   or a phospholipid, or all sorts of things like that.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   So when we eat foods that contain fat,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.480]   basically there are three distinctions for that fat.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.560]   Is it saturated?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360]   Is it monounsaturated, one double bond?
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.920]   Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds?
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.800]   The observation that eating saturated fat
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.080]   raises cholesterol is generally correct.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
