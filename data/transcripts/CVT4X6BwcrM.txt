[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Cal writes in to ask, "Pastor John, I'm right now reading through your book,
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.120]   'Don't Waste Your Life,' and I have a question about Galatians 6:14 and boasting
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.000]   only in the cross. Specifically, what does it mean to be dead to the world?"
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Let me get the verse right in front of us so we can hear how that phrase occurs.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So the question's coming, I think, from that last phrase,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   "I am crucified to the world," or "I am dead to the world."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So my first question is, even before I ask, "What does it mean to be dead to the world?"
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   is, "What does it mean to be dead?" And I think, in Paul's mind,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   that idea of Christians being dead starts with Jesus' words in a bunch of places
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   in the Gospels, like Luke 9, where he says, "The Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and be killed, and on the third day be raised." And he said to all,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   and follow me." Now when Bonhoeffer read that, remember, he said,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   "Jesus was saying, 'When I call you, I bid you to come and die.'"
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So to take a cross means to die. So to follow Jesus is to experience
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   a kind of death. And the way he says it in Luke 9 is,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   it's a daily taking up of the cross. So there's a daily dying going on.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And then when Paul picks that up, I think, for example, when he describes baptism,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   he says, "We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   was raised from the dead, we too might walk in newness of life."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So at the point of conversion and faith, signified in the waters of baptism,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   we are being united to Christ, and when we're united to Christ,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the death that he dies, we die. In fact, the very next verse, I think,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   in Romans 6, verse 5, makes that connection with union with Christ.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   If we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   with him in a resurrection like his. So we died when we were united to Christ,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and we were united to Christ when we believed in him and signified that
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   in baptism. And so for me, the next question becomes, "So who died?"
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm a living... I'm talking to you right now, and Cal wrote and asked the question,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   so he doesn't sound dead, he's thinking. So who actually died?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So let's go back to Galatians, and Paul, I think, answers that,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   helps answer it anyway, when he says in chapter 5, "Those who belong to Christ
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So the old me, which Paul calls the flesh, that self-reliant, proud, idolatrous,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   world-loving, world-worshiping self, died when I trusted Christ,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   because I was united with him in his death, and when he died, I died,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and the part of me that dies is the old unbelieving, self-reliant self.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And a new person comes into being, and who's that?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And Galatians gives the answer again. I think, I mean, one of my favorite verses
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   in all the Bible, ever since I was a sophomore in college, has been Galatians 2:20,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So it sounds like the new person who's alive is Christ, but then it says,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "And the life I now live..." So, "Oh, I thought I was dead."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   No, you're not dead, because as Christ lives, you're alive. How?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith, in the Son of God,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   who loved me and gave himself for me. So the new me is not the old unbelieving,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   selfish, self-reliant, world-worshipping me. It's the new trusting in Christ,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   enjoying the life of Christ in me person. So there's this new creation,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   there's this new Cal, this new Tony that has come into being,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and it's marked mainly by "I live by faith." And I think faith is not only
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   trusting that he died for me, but trusting him for all that God is for me in him.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He has become my world. He has become my treasure. He has become my satisfaction.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So now I go back. After all that, I go back to Galatians 6:14,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   where it says we're dead or we're crucified to the world, and I think that means
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   my flesh once loved the world. Back in verse 24 of chapter 5, it said it died
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   with its passions and its desires. My old flesh just loved the world,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   craved the world, depended on the world, needed the world, worshipped the world
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   as its God and its satisfaction. And now all that died, and the world now
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   has been crucified to me as a God. So if you say, "What sense does the world
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   die to me?" I said, "The world once was a God to me. It once was my life,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and I killed it. I crucified it. I put it to death with its desires,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and my flesh died. So my dying to it and it dying to me is the same reality.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I killed this pseudo-reality called the world, which was posing as an all-satisfying
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   God to me, and my old, blind, foolish self who worshipped this world died
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   when I died with Christ." And here's just one...when I think about this,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I want to make one qualification because God made the world. The world is not evil.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Material is not evil. Physicality is not evil. God meant the world to be
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   not our God but a gift. And so maybe the simplest way to say it is that
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   when you come to Christ and the old world-worshipping self dies,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   what comes alive is a self of faith in Christ that receives the world
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   no longer as a God but as a gift. So I would say directly to Cal,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   every time the world starts to claim for itself more than it is, tell it,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "World, I'm dead to that pseudo-claim. Jesus is my treasure now.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   He died to have me, and he died to give himself to me as my all-satisfying treasure.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So world, I'm dead to you, and you're dead to me as a God,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and I now come to you no longer as my God but as a gift from my loving Savior.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And every time you come to me now, I'm going to see Him in you,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and if I can't see Him in you, I'm going to reject you."
