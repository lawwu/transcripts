[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.900]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.460]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today I'm going to share with
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.040]   you some stories and some ideas that I hope will enrich your life so that you can appreciate
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:02.160]   today, and gain more from it than you otherwise would.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.640]   One of the things that I have been guilty of in my life, one of the regrets that I have,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.540]   is always looking toward the future. It seems to me that some people are very good at looking
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.800]   to the future, some people are not so good at looking to the future. Many people that
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   I've talked to, you ask them, "What do you think you want to do in the future? What are
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.480]   your goals?" And they don't have goals, they don't have ambitions. And for me, that's almost
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.280]   anathema to me. I can't even imagine not having goals or ambitions. I don't know whether it's
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.680]   personality type, I don't know whether it's a cultivated personality, or whether it's
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.120]   just simply an inborn personality trait. All I know is that I'm a very future-oriented
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.320]   person. And I think that has really distinct advantages. One of the most reliable indicators
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.440]   of wealth, in terms of whether a person will actually build wealth or not, is their level
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.880]   of future orientation. Are they able to sacrifice now and delay gratification now for the future?
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.080]   And so this personality that I have has served me well.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   But there has also been a flip side to that personality. It seems to me that almost every
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.720]   personality trait has a positive and a negative. And there are dangers to almost any trait.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   And while there are many benefits to being a future-oriented person, I can easily see
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   the future to some degree, I can easily sacrifice now for rewards later, and that's really helpful.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.560]   The flip side is I can often forget about the present. And I can often be so fixated
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.600]   on what I want in the future that I neglect the present. And friends, that's really bad.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   That's really harmful. And as I grow older and look back upon my life and reflect upon
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.440]   the things that I feel like I've done well and things I feel like I haven't done well,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.620]   one of the themes that I can see in my own journey is that I've often not taken full
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.960]   advantage of enjoying the process. I'll give you a simple example. I'm a very competent
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.520]   financial planner with a long list of letters after my name indicating a lot of study. I
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.800]   have a master's degree in financial planning. I formerly was a certified financial planner,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.780]   although I no longer maintain that designation. I'm a chartered life underwriter, a chartered
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.480]   financial consultant, a registered employee benefits consultant, a registered health underwriter,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.340]   a chartered advisor of philanthropy, and CLU, CHF, CCP. I think there's one or two more
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.200]   that I just can't think of. Maybe not. I don't know. Anyway, if I go in my attic where I
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   have all the stuff stored of my old life, I could produce a box that has about nine
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.660]   or ten framed big fancy-looking diplomas in the financial planning world. And that's served
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.320]   me well. I learned something along the way, and I passed a lot of tests. Basically, all
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.580]   it says is I'm good at passing tests. I'm very good at academics. I've never struggled
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.980]   with academics. It's a skill set that I have that some people don't have, but it's served
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:29.200]   me well. Unfortunately, I feel like I cheated myself along that journey because I was so
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.800]   aggressive and so fast that I didn't take the time to learn everything that I wanted
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.500]   to learn. And this is especially painful to me now because it's so clear as a parent,
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.740]   as I work with my children and their education, it's so obvious to me that I don't want them
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.820]   just to tick boxes, check boxes, "Look, you've done it. I did the work." I want them to really
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.080]   do the work. I want them to really gain experience from the work. And one of the regrets that
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.420]   I have is that I went so fast through all the academics of financial planning, I don't
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.160]   feel like I learned what I should have learned. Sometimes I'll be in a situation and realize
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.800]   there's a weakness in my knowledge here. I don't quite know this thing here. And I've
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.120]   got all the books and I can go and read them, but I didn't get what I should have gotten
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:27.040]   from the experience. I would have been better served if instead of racing through all those
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.720]   dozens and dozens of financial planning classes and financial planning textbooks the way I
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.120]   did, I would have been just to finish them and get all these impressive looking credentials,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.720]   I would have been better served to slow down, take it easy, take more time and really dig
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.540]   into the material. And that's often been a hallmark of my life. I did some shows somewhat
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.720]   recently on reading. You know, it's good to be a big reader and I think there's real value
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   in reading a lot of books. But you know what the flip side of that is? I think it's better
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.400]   to read one book that you implement in your life fully than it is to read 10 books that
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.720]   you don't. Now you can read 10 books and implement ideas from all 10. It's not either or. I'm
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.240]   simply trying to draw out the importance of actually doing the work and gaining from this
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:31.480]   experience now what there is to gain. I don't want that personality trait to continue. I'm
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.960]   working hard to change it in myself. I don't know any objective factors that I could use
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.280]   to see how I'm doing. I'm starting to just being aware of it. But I don't want to always
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.600]   be looking at the future. And this is especially poignant to me now as I raise four small children
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   because if you're always looking to the future, then you miss out on the joy of now. And it's
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.920]   easy, especially with little children. They're tough. They're a lot of work. And you got
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.600]   all these annoying little habits that it's your duty as a parent to train out of them.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.320]   And it makes it easy to get frustrated and to grow short with them. And then you go and
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.200]   you look at somebody else's picture of how cute their children are. And you think, "What
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.960]   am I missing? Am I so focused on where I want my children to be that I'm missing where they
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   are?" I'm not going to live my life like that. I am intensely focused on benefiting from
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:38.400]   today, on enjoying today, on appreciating today. Not because today is perfect, but because
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.240]   today is. And something doesn't have to be perfect for you to appreciate it. Now let's
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:56.840]   turn this to finances, specifically the pursuit of financial freedom. As I get older, it's
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   easier for me to look back and appreciate the hard times that I have experienced. Now,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.320]   I can't imagine that any of us would say that we want a hard time. I don't think any of
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.160]   us would intentionally sign up for something that's just going to be hard without knowing
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   if there's a payoff at the end. But all of us go through hard times. All of us go through
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:30.240]   difficulty. And those hard times have a way of shaping us and forming us. The problem
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   is a lot of times in the middle of those hard times, it's hard to appreciate them. Unless
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.440]   you're extremely wise, it's hard for most of us to appreciate them. So you look back
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   later and you recognize them. I value many of the financial mistakes that I have made,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.440]   many of the hard times that I have made, the hard times that I've gone through. Even the
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.960]   times in my life where I feel like I've made big mistakes, I value a lot of things about
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.920]   them. You know, there have been times in my life where I've been really broke and made
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:11.480]   big mistakes. And I didn't like it. It was humbling. But a lot of times, so much good
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.760]   has come from those. I couldn't do what I do today if I didn't have some empathy and
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.480]   some humility and some hard-fought battle scars from some of those mistakes. Now I wouldn't
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.160]   say that you should go and make those mistakes intentionally, but at least I can appreciate
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.720]   them more. Or in relationship challenges, whether it's difficult friendships or difficult
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   family relationships or difficult romantic relationships, a lot of times when you come
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.240]   out the other side, you can look back and appreciate how something difficult affected
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.280]   you and it formed who you are.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:58.680]   Let's talk about practical application. When I developed the slogan that I lead every show
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.280]   with, "How to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   freedom in 10 years or less," I developed it organically. I tried to put into words
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.560]   what I cared about. And interestingly, I've looked around and I've been looking at other
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.760]   financial brands in the marketplace and it seems like that slogan is everywhere. And
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.960]   I have no idea whether everyone out there is copying me. You're right. Maybe everyone's
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.040]   just copying me and my fantastic language or whether they were all out there and I subconsciously
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.080]   copied them. I don't think I plagiarized anybody, but with ideas you can't control.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.680]   But everyone's focused on that financial freedom in 10 years or less, or at least most of what
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:49.320]   I see. And I want that, right? I'm working on that. I want to help you with that. But
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:59.520]   more than that, that rich and meaningful life now is the key because it would be a great
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:08.340]   horror to push and to rush so frantically for your early retirement that you missed
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:16.680]   out on today. Now let me use some rather obvious examples to try to start with things where
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.960]   I'm sure you'll agree with me and then perhaps some less obvious examples. Let's say that
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:29.920]   you are so focused on financial success. You're so determined to retire early and you know
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.980]   the path to do that is to raise your income very high, cut your expenses very low, and
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.440]   invest the difference wisely. And so you take a very high paying, very high stress job that
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.080]   requires you to travel, to be a road warrior. You have young children, but you say, "No,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.240]   you know what? My dream is to be financially retired very quick, independent, early retired
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.960]   very quickly, and I'm going to be a road warrior." And so you're there on Saturday, you fly in
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.400]   on Friday night and you fly out on Sunday night. And your children grow and you hire
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.760]   professionals to train them because you're not there. And you make your goal, you're
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.160]   making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. But on the flip side, you're also very
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.880]   frugal. So when somebody says, "Can we do this?" You say, "No, we don't have the money."
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.120]   Or "Can we experience that?" "No, we're not going to spend the money, we're saving for
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:27.080]   early retirement." And then five, ten years gets there and you are, you've made it. Except
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.200]   you don't have much of a relationship with your children. They're not that interested
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.560]   in you. And let's just make it even worse, you die. Or you get a diagnosis of cancer.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.360]   What are you going to do? You're going to go spend all your money to try to go and experience
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.640]   something and be together. It sounds like a cliche because you know it in your bones.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:53.720]   You know that would be a life of failure. You know that instead of your children standing
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.680]   up at your funeral and honoring you about what a blessing you were, they would say,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:04.200]   "Well, dad sure liked to work a lot. Made a lot of money, left us rich." You know it.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.680]   That's why it's a cliche for me to even say it. You've seen the bucket list. You've followed
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.840]   people who've done that. So you know that's not the case. Now, I can't imagine that you're
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.480]   doing that. I can't imagine that you're neglecting everything.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   Let's bring it to a slightly more realistic experience. Can you imagine somebody who,
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.960]   yeah, they have a job and they work their job during reasonable hours, but they're so
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   intent on getting out of their job that they just, "I really don't like it. I really don't
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.360]   like it." And they learn to hate all their time at work because they're so excited about
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:58.480]   getting out of work. You can at least imagine that, right? There are people out there like
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:06.760]   that. And yet, what a tragedy. What a tragedy for you to go and work a job for 10 years
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.200]   and all you can think about is quitting instead of actually gaining something from that job.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:18.280]   Now, there's a balance here. If you're not well suited for your job, then go somewhere
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.400]   and go get different work that you're well suited for. But don't hate your job. Even
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.080]   in the middle of a job that you're not well suited for, embrace it and be grateful for
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.280]   it. Be thankful for it.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.720]   Years ago, I used to listen to, when I was a teenager, I bought a bunch of Zig Ziglar
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:42.480]   motivational CDs. And I really loved Zig. I still love Zig. I should go and dig those
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:48.920]   out and listen to them. But Zig Ziglar would tell a story about a woman that came up to
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.080]   him and he was talking about being grateful for what you have. And she said, "Well, I
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.320]   just hate my job." And he said, "Well, there's got to be something you like about your job."
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.080]   She's like, "No, it's all the worst in the world." He said, "Well, they pay you, right?"
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.480]   "Yeah, they pay me." "Well, you like getting paid, don't you?" "Yeah, I like getting paid."
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.400]   And he had the lady as an exercise. He had the lady make a list of all the things that
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.480]   they, that she liked about her job. They paid her for working there. So she went to work
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.960]   and she got a paycheck and she liked getting a paycheck. She had nice coworkers. She had
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.480]   a comfortable office. It wasn't very far from her house. And she made a list of all these
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.640]   things that she liked about her job.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.680]   And as the story went, when she came in on the first day, she just talked to him at a
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.880]   seminar. She hated her job and everything about it. And his answer was, "Well, they're
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.240]   about to fire you. It's going to get worse because they're about to fire you." Because
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.080]   she was so toxic that nobody would want to be around her. Well, he had her make this
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.640]   list. I forget, 25 things or something about that she loved about her job. And he said,
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.240]   "Go home every day and look yourself in the mirror and say, 'I love my job because they
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.600]   pay me. I love my job because it's close to me.'" He said, "Look at yourself in the mirror
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:10.160]   and say it every day." It's an affirmation. And it revolutionized her experience. She
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.560]   came to his next seminar, next time he was in town, and said, "I love my job. I've gotten
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.600]   paid. I got a promotion. I got a bigger paycheck and a raise, etc. It was a total success."
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.960]   Not because anything external to the job changed, but because she changed. Because she came
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.840]   to appreciate what she had.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:37.640]   By the way, if you don't love your job, start there. Start with that. Not necessarily looking
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.080]   for another one, but looking to appreciate everything that you can about your job. What
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.400]   about your wife? Can you learn to appreciate something? "Oh, mine's terrible. I got a bad
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.440]   one." Well, an exercise that I've heard, I've done it, and I've heard other people talk
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   about it. It's transformative. I recommend it to you. Even right here in Thanksgiving,
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:07.040]   going into Thanksgiving tomorrow. Get a journal, notebook, something, and start keeping a journal
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:14.600]   of things that you appreciate about your wife. Every day, write down something that you appreciate.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.720]   I've heard stories of people who had very terrible marriages, and this suggestion was
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:28.360]   given to them, "Just write one short journal entry every day." And they found out that
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.560]   within a few months, their entire relationship had changed. Because instead of looking for
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.160]   all the things that were wrong with their wife, they started looking desperately for
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.760]   all the things that were right. And all the other stuff just fades away.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.000]   You can do this with almost anything. For me, one of the most... I've always had a fairly
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.760]   good marriage relationship, but never really had really bad jobs. But one transformative
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.280]   thing that I experienced was when I was in college. And when I was in college, my first
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.080]   two years, my teachers were dumb. They didn't know what they were talking about. I wasn't
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   learning anything. Then I went and studied abroad, came back, and all of a sudden, something
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.200]   had changed. My teachers were totally different. They actually knew something, and I was learning
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.360]   things as I was in school. Well, long story there, but nothing about the school changed.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:24.440]   Nothing about the teachers changed. I changed. I came to appreciate what I had.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.160]   And these are some of the things that are at the heart of gratitude. The first thing
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:38.760]   is resolve not to miss the joy of today. None of us are guaranteed tomorrow. You're not
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.840]   guaranteed tomorrow. Your wife is not guaranteed tomorrow. Your children are not guaranteed
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:54.520]   tomorrow. None of us are guaranteed tomorrow. All we have is today. Now, if we embrace today,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:00.600]   and we appreciate what today offers, we can learn and be filled with gratitude for the
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.640]   great things that we have today.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.760]   There's a viral video going around the internet world at the moment that was put out this
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:15.800]   year, 2019, by some church somewhere. I don't know where. It's kind of a Christmas video.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:22.280]   And their point was, "Appreciate what you have today." And it shows this father waking
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.720]   up and going into his bathroom and turning on the sink and just being overjoyed at the
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.880]   fact that you could go and water would come out of the sink, or playing with the light
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.520]   switch and being overjoyed that you can push the light switch and the light would come
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.960]   on. You probably experienced that at least once, right? Your lights go out, your water
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.120]   goes out, and you realize, "I'm going to take that for granted." Goes down and opens the
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.200]   cupboard. "We have food! This is exciting!" Walks out the front door to go to work. "I
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.360]   have a car that I can drive! Exciting!" Nothing changed. It's just to appreciate the things
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.760]   that you do have.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.360]   That's why one of the exercises I think we can do from time to time that's extremely
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   valuable is simply put ourselves into positions of hardship. You pick how you do it. Go and
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   get a cardboard box and sleep on the street with the homeless people in your town so you
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.520]   can appreciate what they face, or go camping, or go traveling, or put yourself in some kind
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.360]   of situation regularly. Don't shy away from difficulty because you'll come back and you'll
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.480]   appreciate your house, you'll appreciate your bed, you'll appreciate your family. Gratitude
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.000]   makes all the difference. And gratitude starts with your attitude. When you change your attitude,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.920]   you can start to feel grateful, feel thankful. And truly, you and I are so blessed. If nothing
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:50.440]   else, we are so blessed to live in the time that we live in. In the 21st century, there
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   has never been a time in human history where there was more opportunity available to an
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:03.680]   average person than today. There's never been a time in human history where there were more
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:12.080]   conveniences available than today, more comforts available than today, more access to the world,
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.720]   the things that you and I take for granted would have been unimaginable a century ago.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.360]   And even the problems that we face, the hardships, the trials, in so many ways, there's never
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:34.680]   been a time where those hardships and trials have been more easily surmounted. We truly
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:42.840]   live in an incredible time. And no matter what the personal challenges you're facing,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.880]   it's easier for you to face them today than it would have been 30 years ago. We live in
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.720]   such an incredible, abundant time, an incredible, abundant place. Now, what about the things
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.680]   that are hard? What about the things that are really difficult? You face a difficult
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:07.960]   job. You face a difficult home life. You're broke. You're in debt. Or whatever other difficulties.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.640]   I try to focus on these financial-related difficulties. But whatever difficulties you're
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:23.480]   facing, if you will dig in to your situation, you don't need to hide from the emotion of
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.720]   it. You don't need to pretend that everything is good. I can't stand lack of honesty. Everything's
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:37.640]   good. No, dig in to it. But let the situation work in you. And if you let the situation
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:46.320]   work in you, it will change you. And then on the other side of it, you'll be grateful
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.000]   for that change that has been wrought. When you allow that process to work its course
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.400]   through you, you'll look back at the situation and you'll appreciate it for what it did in
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.600]   you. Think about something like boot camp in the military. Is it fun to go through boot
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.080]   camp? I don't know that anyone thinks it's fun. But everybody acknowledges that it's
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:16.160]   useful. The military hires up, all acknowledge that, "Hey, this is useful because it's
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.400]   molding people into soldiers." And then the people that go through it recognize it's useful
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.560]   as a crucible. It's useful, even though it's difficult. And if you just look at your life
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.520]   and say, "How can I get out of all these hardships as quickly as possible?" You might miss the
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.040]   lessons. Now, get out of the hardships if possible, but while you're in it, don't reject
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:42.360]   them. Don't say, "Oh, these aren't, these are useless." Don't miss the lessons in the
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   moment. Be thankful for them. I can't share this message with you without clearly denoting
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.720]   the origin of these ideas. And so, let me just share that with you. One of the most
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:07.080]   important passages in the Bible, I think, is the passage where it talks about being
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.480]   thankful in all things. It's the end of a book called 1 Thessalonians, written by the
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.800]   apostle Paul, but there's a little verse in 1 Thessalonians 5 where Paul says this. He
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:24.200]   says, "Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.760]   Jesus. Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.120]   you." Now, I don't know whether you belong to Christ Jesus or not. I hope you do. But
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:45.800]   regardless, be thankful. Be thankful in all circumstances. Now, the thing that is most
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   impressive to me is the man who wrote those words had a brutally difficult life. When
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:02.680]   he wrote those words, he was headed for execution by the government in prison. Prison wasn't
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.920]   very nice. Still not nice, but wasn't very nice at the time. Had faced tremendous personal
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   difficulties, but still wrote, "Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.080]   of God in Christ Jesus for you." If I'm ever talking with somebody and counseling, they're
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.000]   saying, "What's the will of God for me? What is God's will for me?" One of the difficult
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.480]   questions to discern oftentimes. Well, we know for certain that the will of God for
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:39.680]   you right now is to give thanks in your current circumstances. Now, there's more. I love that
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:46.960]   passage. "We urge you, brothers, admonish the idle." God's will is not that you be idle.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.980]   God's will is that you be industrious, not idle. "Encourage the faint-hearted." I'm seeking
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.460]   to do that here today. If you're struggling, I hope that my words are encouraging to you.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:06.660]   Encourage the faint-hearted. "Help the weak." If you see somebody who's weak, go and help.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.920]   Be patient with them all. "See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:18.980]   to do good to one another and to everyone." Don't ever repay evil for evil. Always seek
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:27.340]   to do good to one another and to everyone. "Rejoice always." Always rejoice. Rejoice
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:34.040]   always. "Pray without ceasing." Give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:41.740]   of God in Christ Jesus for you. "Do not quench the Spirit." Do not despise prophecies, but
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:54.860]   test everything. "Hold fast what is good and abstain from every form of evil."
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:02.380]   Appreciate in yourself gratitude. Gratitude to God for the circumstances that he has put
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:11.860]   you in. I guess I'll also just share with you about where does the philosophy of appreciating
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:18.600]   the circumstances that you're in. My favorite book of the Bible is the book of James, written
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.540]   by the half-brother of Jesus. And the first one of the earliest chapters of scripture
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.580]   I remember memorizing, I'm sure there were others, was James chapter 1. And let me just
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:37.180]   share it with you because it encapsulates this message. And in my mind, it's always
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:42.900]   the right answer. "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:50.540]   kinds. For you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:56.980]   have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. If any of
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.620]   you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.780]   will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting. For the one who doubts is
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.680]   like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.940]   suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He's a double-minded man, unstable
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:25.580]   in all his ways. Let the lowly brother boast in his exultation, and the rich in his humiliation.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.700]   Because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   heat and withers the grass. Its flower falls and its beauty perishes. So also will the
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:43.940]   rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits. Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.860]   trial. For when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which God
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.660]   has promised to those who love him. Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.100]   tempted by God." For God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempts no one. But
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:07.460]   each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire, when
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:13.100]   it has conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.900]   death.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.660]   Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.060]   coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.820]   its change. Of His own will He brought us forth, by the word of truth, that we should
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.460]   be a kind of first fruits of His creatures. Know this, my beloved brothers, let every
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:43.020]   person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger. For the anger of man does not produce
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.740]   the righteousness of God. Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness, and
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:56.620]   receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:02.900]   of the word, not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:08.140]   not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.340]   at himself and goes away, and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:21.500]   the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets, but a doer who
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:28.380]   acts, he will be blessed in his doing. If anyone thinks he is religious and does not
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:36.100]   bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless. Religion
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:42.340]   that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.860]   in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.620]   You can go ahead and read the rest of the book of James if you want. It goes on to talk
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:31:03.300]   about people with gold rings and fine clothing and riches, etc. But I guess those two scripture
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.700]   passages would encapsulate what I'm trying to share. Simply, give thanks in the circumstances
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:15.540]   that you're in. And when you develop that heart attitude of gratitude, it will change
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:23.340]   your experience of those circumstances. And second, be steadfast in your circumstances,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:31.220]   no matter what they are. Because the test will produce something in you if you allow
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:42.140]   it. Military officers don't put prospective soldiers through boot camp just for fun. Teachers
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:51.540]   don't give tests just for fun. Parents don't give their children hard things just for fun.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.620]   If somebody wants to be a soldier without going through boot camp and training, or if
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.900]   somebody wants to be a student without ever facing a hard exam, or if somebody wants to
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.740]   be a child with the ambition to grow into maturity without ever having to face something
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:15.180]   hard, they're fooling themselves. You don't get strong muscles without lifting heavy weights.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:24.380]   And it's the same in every part of life. So don't get so focused on getting rich now as
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:36.780]   fast as possible that you forget to live rich now. There's a proper balance. You will regret
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:43.580]   it if you spend all of your time and all your energy just desperately working to save money
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.260]   and get rich so that you can get out of where you are if you don't appreciate where you
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.740]   are. If you don't focus on embracing the challenge of where you are. You can change. You should
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.620]   change. If things aren't well suited for you, there's no reason to continue them unnecessarily.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:08.780]   But don't miss the lessons. Don't be as dumb as I have been to rush through things so you
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:16.580]   can get all the impressive credentials and qualifications and not learn the material.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:22.860]   That's something that has affected me for far too long. I'm not willing to let it affect
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:31.180]   me for any longer. Embrace the challenges. Embrace the struggle. Embrace the difficulty.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.380]   Embrace the things that aren't quite how you want them to be. Give thanks for those things.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:43.460]   And as you're working to improve, you will gain the lessons that you need to gain.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.980]   As I go today, I want to just simply share with you I'm running a sale. I'll come out

[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.580]   a large comprehensive look at how to actually achieve financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.380]   As you are enjoying, if you're in the US American market, as you're enjoying the Thanksgiving
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.340]   holiday or if you just wherever you are as you're looking forward to the end of 2019,
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:04.540]   take some time and reflect on the decade. Decades are pretty cool. As human beings,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:12.180]   our brains are wired for round numbers, right? 20, 30, 40, 50. These are pivotal years, not
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.980]   because anything actually changes, because in our heads, it's easy for us to think in
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:23.280]   big pictures. Same thing with calendar years, decades, millennia. All of these make a difference
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:31.540]   to us. And there's a good chance that you won't be able to achieve everything you want
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:38.140]   to achieve in 2020. Because when you lay out your goals, you'll probably be too aggressive
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:44.100]   and too optimistic. You'll probably lay out for yourself far too much. I've certainly
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:53.380]   done that. But if you give yourself a decade, you can do a lot in a decade. And I'm going
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.020]   to be talking with you next week about how to set financial goals and talking to you
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:05.040]   about goals that you can set. But this coming decade from 2020 to 2030 could very well be
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:13.620]   the very best decade of your life. Certainly, it can be the best decade of your life financially.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.420]   But that doesn't have to come at the cost of other important areas of your life. It
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:27.820]   can be the best area of your life in every facet of your life. And if you pull back and
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:33.500]   allow yourself to think about a decade, it's such an abundant amount of time that it'll
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:39.100]   probably free you from the restrictions that you've imposed on yourself in the past. Because
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.940]   in the past, you've tried things for a year and you failed in February. We all have. In
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:52.020]   the past, you probably said, "Well, I could get a little bit better in a year and then
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:58.260]   failed." But a decade is long enough that you can imagine making changes. Again, we'll
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.660]   talk about this next week when we talk about goal setting. But a decade is long enough
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:10.100]   for you to enter and master an entirely new career. Starting today, no matter where you
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:17.820]   are, you can lay out a plan to change from your current career and to move into an entirely
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:27.020]   new career and even master it within the decade. By the way, you should be thinking about that
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:34.500]   because chances are pretty good that your entire career is going to change around you.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:41.020]   The only way to predict that change is to make it. We'll talk about some career goals.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:49.260]   A decade is long enough for you to 10x your income. You can absolutely 10x your income
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.140]   in a decade. Take a moment. Here I am getting into it. I said I was going to do it Monday.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:38:00.580]   Take a moment and just stop and think for a moment about what your current income is.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:06.860]   How much income are you going to declare on your tax return for 2019? Now, add a zero
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:14.660]   to that. A decade from now, that can be the amount of income that you declare on your
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:21.700]   2029 tax return. We'll talk about some savings goals. We'll talk about a financial freedom
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:28.420]   plan. But a decade is enough for you to achieve total financial abundance and total financial
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:38.500]   freedom without sacrificing everything else that's important to you. I will achieve financial
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.420]   independence within the next 10 years. It should be significantly less than that, but
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.180]   within 10 years, I don't mind giving myself extra time. It's one of the biggest mistakes
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.980]   that I made when I was younger. I think that, well, everything's got to happen right on
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.420]   schedule. If you set a goal and you don't hit it right on schedule, so what? Give it
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.340]   a little bit more time and work at it again. The only thing that makes it impossible for
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:05.820]   you to fail, sorry, impossible for you to succeed is quitting. But when you just don't
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.860]   quit, give yourself a little bit more time to achieve the goal. Go for it. You have a
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.740]   goal to become financially independent in five years, but the stock market turns upside
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.780]   down. You waste a bunch of money. You lose a bunch of money. You make bad investments
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:23.100]   and it takes you 15 years. So what? You get there eventually. The numbers in some ways
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.420]   aren't really meaningful. Back to the point. You can achieve total financial independence,
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.060]   total financial freedom in the next decade. So many people have done it. The methods of
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:38.740]   doing it at this point are practically scientific. There are a few things that can't be controlled.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:45.780]   Most of those things can be insured for. But you, no matter where you're from, you can
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.300]   learn what you need to learn. You can develop the habits that you need to develop. You can
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   do the things that you need to do to achieve total financial freedom in the next decade.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:04.700]   We'll talk about that throughout the month of December. Spend some time, as perhaps you
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:11.580]   enjoy a holiday weekend, spend some time reflecting on where you'd like to be a decade from now.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:19.260]   Lay out a vision because a decade is long enough for you to achieve anything that you
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:27.220]   have set for yourself. You can lose 300 pounds and become a bodybuilder in a decade. Can't
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:33.540]   do it in a year, but you can do it in a decade. You can pay off a million dollars of debt.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:38.100]   May or may not be able to do it in a year, but you can do it in a decade. You get the
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:43.500]   point. Enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday. Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store. Use the
