[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   you're trying to help someone think about constructing their
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.920]   their kind of two week itinerary to France, how would you think
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.760]   about breaking it out? And, you know, of all the places you just
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.880]   mentioned, are there some highlights you think are great
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.080]   for a first trip?
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.160]   Well, you know, the the feedback I get from people is that, you
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.480]   know, if they fly directly into Paris, it makes sense to sort of
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.440]   start there, get acclimated, take your time, you know, it's a
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.160]   great place to just sort of walk around. So if you're if you're
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.200]   heavily jet lagged, and you're sort of gearing up for maybe
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.840]   even a more active trip in the next places you're going, it's
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.360]   good to sort of ease in with Paris. And you know, if you're
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.320]   if it's a lot easier to adjust, if you know, all you have to do
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320]   is walk out your apartment or hotel door and you know, stumble
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.760]   upon a restaurant, you don't have to go very far, in other
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.640]   words, to sort of get yourself get yourself going when you
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.800]   arrive. So I would say spending a handful of days, at least
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   three or at least four days in Paris would be ideal, to be
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.720]   honest, before making making your way elsewhere. And I think
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.040]   for a first time visitor, it makes it honestly makes sense to
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.600]   do one of two things going to Normandy because of the sort of
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.880]   cultural awareness that exists, or skipping that and going
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.200]   directly to the south of France, because you know, that's sort
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.480]   of one of the other iconic experiences, and something that
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.320]   is so very different from the Parisian experience.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.600]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks show
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800]   about upgrading your life, money and travel. One of the areas I
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   love to optimize is travel. And today we're going to talk about
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.160]   everything you need to know for a trip to France, the world's
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   most popular tourist destination. We'll dig into some
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.280]   unique off the beaten path spots in Paris, talk about how to
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.200]   have lunch like a local and run through all the top regions to
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.360]   visit. I've been to France about five times now, but I couldn't
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.800]   think of a better guest to join me than Lindsay Tramuta, who's
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   been living there since 2006. She's a culture and travel
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   journalist who's written for the New York Times, eater food
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.360]   and wine, CondÃ© Nast, traveler and more. She's also written a
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.480]   bunch of books on Paris, including the new Paris and the
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.200]   new Parisienne, including a restaurant guide, and even has
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.360]   her own podcast called the new Paris podcast. So whether you're
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.840]   thinking about your first trip to France, or you already know
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   you'll be back there, I think you'll love this episode. So
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   let's jump in. Oh, and don't forget, if you're enjoying this,

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.400]   really help this channel. Thanks so much.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.880]   Lindsay, thank you for being here. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.480]   Yeah, I am excited. France is one of the most popular not not
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   one. It is the most popular tourist destination in the
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640]   world. I expect most people listening have either been
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.880]   considered going or even have a trip on the horizon. So I'm
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.600]   going to start us off. I have two questions for you. One, why
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.520]   do you think France is number one? And what do you think the
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.320]   100 million people who come each year might be missing when they
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.600]   go?
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.720]   That's a very good starter question. I think the sort of
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.280]   enduring popularity has to do with the way France continues to
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.440]   enter popular culture. So whether it's through through
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.360]   books, through film, through television shows, I mean,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.120]   generations of this sort of myth making and and fantasy
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.000]   building about France as a destination, really goes far
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.480]   deeper than a lot of other cultures. Also, I think the
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.240]   really goes far deeper than a lot of other cultures. Also,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   you have to remember the long relationship between the US if
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.680]   we're obviously France is a global destination. But when we
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280]   think about how much it appeals to Americans in particular, you
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.400]   know, that relates to the long history between the two
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   countries. And, you know, essentially, France was one of
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.960]   America's first allies. And so I think all of that combined
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.560]   creates a sort of attachment, and a fantasy for people even
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.040]   who, you know, might be armchair travelers, but who know that the
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   one day that they do, you know, sort of get on the road and are
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.720]   able to come to Europe, this is probably going to be one of the
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   first places they come. And I would say Italy probably has
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.840]   some of this appeal as well, because of the way, you know,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.680]   especially the Italian diaspora, having such, such reach around
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.400]   the world. But actually, the one thing I did come across in
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.800]   some of the research I've done over the years is that because
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.960]   France doesn't have a huge immigrant community in the
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.680]   United States, for example, there's, there's a bit more
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.960]   mystery involved. And so I think that plays a role as well.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.080]   There's a there's a sort of mystery for the average person
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.520]   as to well, what is France really like, you know, we've
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.760]   seen this, we've, we've seen the, the films, we've heard the
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   stories, what is it really like, and I think that is a compelling
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.480]   draw. As for what people are missing. Really, if you if you
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560]   if you're focused entirely on a bucket list, that's already, I
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   think, going to lead you down a direction of being potentially
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.680]   disappointed. I mean, I think the kind of version of travel
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.440]   that I like to promote and that I, you know, that I engage in
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   myself is really trying to see some of the historic things, but
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.080]   then quickly add in whatever a local might do. And I know that
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.840]   sounds sort of like, yeah, how local can you really get? But I
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.120]   think if you're researching with, you're researching your
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.760]   trip, in the right places and listening to the right people,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.800]   you'll get that more local experience. Because ultimately,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.840]   I want to know where, you know, yeah, where the people who are
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.040]   like me in Paris go when they're in, you know, Rome or, or Sydney
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.560]   or Tokyo. And I, I think that from from my interactions with
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   people who have traveled heavily, if you try to do too
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   much, also, on a first trip, or on any trip to Paris, or to the
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   rest of France, I think you'll get easily overwhelmed, and then
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   kind of bogged down by all of the things you saw and almost
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.880]   incapable of, of remembering sort of what the highlights
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   were. So I think it's about going slower, and figuring out
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   what the perfect blend is between, you know, sort of
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.000]   marquee sites and landmarks and experiences, and then those that
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.920]   are maybe a little bit less expected and more atypical.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.520]   I love that. I've actually gotten, I think, more feedback
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.960]   from listeners that the thing they want. And, you know, we
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   were connected by Brandon Presser, who we've had two
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   episodes with, and we actually talked about planning a trip. So
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.000]   you don't know this yet. I'm springing this on you. But it's
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.360]   like, every time we do one of these episodes, I was like, what
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.400]   if after we actually organize an amazing trip together for
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.240]   people in the community to potentially go to this place and
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.000]   do some of these things. And the feedback I got was that
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   everyone loved the idea of traveling slash like, feeling
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.080]   like a local experience. Like that is the thing that I think
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.640]   this audience resonates with. So you I'm so glad you're here
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.160]   because you you value that greatly.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.840]   Absolutely. And I see I see the travelers who are sort of like,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.240]   Oh, yeah, I mean, we, even the way they frame the conversation
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.360]   around what they've done, it's, we did this, this city, we did
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.280]   that museum, it's like, are you doing what I mean, like, are you
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.520]   just checking it off a list? Or are you experiencing it? And so
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.960]   I think those words are very important to the way we sort of
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   dismiss like, yeah, been there done that I think that's a very
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.480]   reductive way of looking at traveling to any kind of
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.120]   destination.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.040]   Yeah, so we're gonna get into a lot of that stuff. And I'm very
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.400]   excited. So but first off, you know, for people who haven't
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.480]   experienced France, whether that means they've never been or
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.400]   whether they did the kind of thing, which I'm certainly
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.480]   guilty of early in my life of, let's go to a city, let's try to
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.720]   do it in two days. Let's go to the like, top five sites
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.360]   bouncing, like, I've had that trip. I don't love that trip
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.560]   anymore. But I've certainly been there. So maybe give some
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.680]   highlights. What what do you think makes a trip to France so
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   much different than other places in the world, whether it's
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.960]   people or food or culture, like, you know, kind of get get people
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.280]   a little bit, a little bit wet their appetite for for where
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.640]   we're going to go with this conversation?
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.640]   Well, you know, what I think is even astounding to me as someone
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.760]   who's lived here for 16 years is how each region really feels so
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.000]   different. So yes, you're in the same country, there's this, you
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.160]   know, a semblance of shared values, of course, across the
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.320]   country. And, you know, but beyond that, geographically,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:18.000]   gastronomically, in, in so many other ways, culturally, each
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.480]   region really feels like it could be it's almost its own
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.520]   country. And but the great thing is that it is so easy to get
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.400]   around here, through trains. Obviously, there's most of
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.440]   everything you want to see and do can be accessed either on by
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   train or by by a quick flight. And, and that's kind of a huge
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.440]   gift, especially when you you know, obviously, you're in the
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   US, I grew up in the US, and everything is such an ordeal.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.360]   It's such a, it's such an expense. It takes ages to get
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   most places. And then once you're there, you kind of are
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   also like, I got to maximize my time here. And I think the
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.880]   ability to, to engage in like much slower travel is all the
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.920]   more possible here. So I would say one of the compelling
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.480]   reasons I think one of the gifts of France really is that you can
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.000]   start in the north and go east, west or straight to the south.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   And every experience you have is going to feel slightly different
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.720]   because they're really their own, you know, their own little
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.400]   mini cultures and microcultures. And, and so that's why, you
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.440]   know, one of the things that sort of occurred to me through
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.560]   COVID, when I couldn't go very far, was just how lucky I was to
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.320]   have all of this on my doorstep, you know, and in that case, you
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.840]   know, what's taking less trains, but I would get in the, in the
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.400]   car with my husband, and we would go on more road trips. And
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.760]   I think if you're someone who also likes to, you know, the
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.440]   idea of renting a car and driving across France, that's
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.880]   also possible. And, you know, to give you an example, my husband
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   just went on a rock climbing trip. I mean, he's, he's away
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   right now and drove six hours, arrives, and he's already, you
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.800]   know, already got in a session last night after, you know, a
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.760]   six hour car ride. And I mean, it just, obviously, the size of
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.920]   the country allows you to do that. But when you live here,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.120]   whether you live here, or you're just visiting, I mean, that that
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.240]   is something that means you can actually do quite a lot and have
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.680]   very different experiences in one trip.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   Yeah, the one new parable I adhere to on any trip is travel
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.840]   like you're coming back for sure. Because I feel like early
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.600]   on my idea was gosh, there's so many places in the world to go
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.520]   to. Every time I go somewhere, I have to act as if I'm never
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.120]   coming back. Like I literally 180 my perspective of make sure
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.520]   I do everything cram it all in because I might not be back to
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.200]   let's just assume I'm absolutely coming back and have a good
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.520]   experience and, and so got the right mindset. Yeah. And culture
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   is is an interesting one, because I think it's it's not
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.960]   something that easily fits on a checklist. But it's something
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.480]   that when you really experience it, it's so memorable. So I had
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.400]   a conversation with Rolf Potts, who wrote a book called
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   vagabonding. And I can't remember if this was in the
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.200]   pre talk or in the episode, but he said he was talking to
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.880]   someone who went to France and was so frustrated that all they
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.160]   wanted to do was they wanted to experience the culture of
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.280]   France. And they went to a cafe, and they sat out on the
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.320]   sidewalk, people were walking by. And two hours later, they
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.680]   still hadn't been able to eat and get their bill. And they
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.200]   were so frustrated, because all they wanted to do was leave the
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.320]   cafe to go experience the culture of France. And he's
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   like, you just missed it. Like sitting at a cafe, taking two
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.160]   hours to eat your lunch is literally experiencing the
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.760]   culture of this country. Yet you were so focused on trying to go
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.320]   do things. So my new thing is relax, slow down, experience
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.160]   what's there. Don't plan too much.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.200]   Absolutely. I mean, also, that's how you, you know, when you're
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.640]   when you're racing to get to the next, I don't know, museum
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.040]   visit, or food tour, or whatever, that's when you miss
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.280]   some of the most memorable moments, also, because of the
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.600]   people you're going to be exposed to, whether it's the
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.200]   person sitting at the table next to you, or sort of the, you
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.000]   know, the strangers walking by, but I mean, and also France has
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.560]   the idea of the flaneur. So someone who strolls aimlessly,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.160]   really with no destination, and it and strolling is is almost an
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.240]   inadequate word for the idea, because it truly means that you
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.200]   are at, you are one at one with the with the with, with the
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.520]   sidewalk with with the city with the, the natural motion of the
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.360]   city, you're, you're seeing things you don't usually see,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.240]   whether it's like, you know, the guy managing the Ferris wheel in
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.440]   one of the parks to someone selling chestnuts on the, you
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.960]   know, at the metro exit, but like, you're fine, your eyes are
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.120]   open. And because you're not trying to get anywhere, you're
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.280]   seeing the city in a way or city or place or wherever, in a way,
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.360]   you don't usually see it. So this idea of the flaneur is
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.960]   something that I think is very, is naturally appealing to
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.440]   travelers, if if they're prepared to sort of set the
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   bucket list aside, set the checklist aside and just be and
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.960]   so if it means you miss one of the museums, like, you'll be
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   fine. I think you'll still get a good sense of both what this
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.360]   place is and how rich it is.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.760]   Yeah. Okay. So here's my thought. Let's talk high level
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.800]   first just about generally structuring a trip because it's
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.160]   a big country. If someone has limited time, they can't do
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.440]   everything. And let's talk after that a little bit about the
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.200]   culture, the people and then dive into some specific places.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.240]   So high level, someone's thinking, I want to go to France,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.120]   let's just talk about when when to come the different seasons.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.920]   And, you know, I'm sure there's an argument for all of them. So
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.720]   so what kind of experiences you'd have and, and maybe how
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.640]   long, how long you need, and, and we'll go from there.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.960]   I mean, obviously, anybody who has two weeks to spend in
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   France, I mean, that's, that's kind of ideal. But I know people
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.040]   who are able to still go slowly, but have, you know, a week or
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.800]   five to seven days, and, and, and visit a couple of places.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.400]   Obviously, it's it's slightly more challenging. And
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.880]   invariably, they wish they had spent more time. But you know,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.960]   whatever, if you don't have two weeks, that's fine. I would say
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.240]   the period of the year is actually more important than
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.640]   necessarily the duration of time. The summer is getting
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:05.200]   increasingly more expensive, for one. It's also extremely hot
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.400]   and dry. I mean, France in, you know, is a victim of, of climate
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.280]   change, just like every destination. But what we're
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.360]   seeing now is increasing periods of drought. So last summer, I
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.880]   was traveling in the Louberon, which is inland in Provence. And
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   there were serious forest fires all over the region. And that
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.440]   continued well throughout the summer. And so there are things
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.040]   that change and what you can and can't do, obviously, when you're
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.240]   in in those parts of France when that's happening. But that also
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.120]   means that, you know, the the probability of encountering a
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.440]   heatwave when you're here during the summer is increasing. And
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.080]   that's even true in Paris, to be frank, like last summer was
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.560]   extremely hot. A series of days going well over, I guess, 40
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.520]   degrees centigrade is what like over 100 degrees, or almost 100
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.680]   degrees Fahrenheit. And when you don't have a lot of AC, like you
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.200]   feel that in a really significant way. So summer for
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.720]   me, is not the ideal time to come. If that's the only period
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   of time you have, then I would maybe guide you toward cooler
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.800]   locations in France, like the coast, the western coast where
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.000]   Brittany is, potentially northern parts of France or
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.400]   Alsace. But you know, even there, they can get extremely
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.000]   have a series of days that are extremely hot. Spring, I mean,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.760]   I'm sitting in Paris right now we are May 18. And the weather
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.120]   has been erratic, not very warm, very rainy since March. And
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.000]   every year is a bit different. So really, we can't speak of
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.240]   sort of like any kind of trend for spring anymore. But the
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.400]   period of the year that seems to be the most reliable is like
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   September, October. So if you're able to sort of wait out the
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.200]   summer travel period and go when most people are back to work,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.520]   then you'll have sort of like the best of the country to
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.600]   yourself. And that's true, even in big cities where yes, things
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.720]   are back into into action. But you've got restaurants that are
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.600]   all back open from their summer holiday, you have all the new
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   sort of museum exhibits and gallery openings and cultural
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.040]   events happening. And so it's kind of a sweet spot. Christmas
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.080]   too, is actually a really lovely time because, you know, a lot of
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.680]   Parisians are sorry, I know, I keep referring to Paris, I mean,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   a lot of locals are going to be with their families wherever
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.240]   you're traveling. But business really keeps going between
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.800]   Christmas and New Year's. So I'd say the worst time of the year,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.720]   I think to be in France is New Year's Day, because literally
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.440]   nothing is open. And I think even if you're in a hotel, you
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.360]   might even have, you know, the the restaurant in house
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.680]   restaurant that's closed. But aside from that, you know, that
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.640]   the the fall is a really great time to come. So my my advice is
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.320]   really, you know, whether you have five days or two weeks, the
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.440]   more important question is, when can you come?
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.040]   Yeah, well, you could make a good trip. I think I've done
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.880]   five trips. And I haven't had a bad trip yet. Obviously, I kept
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.440]   coming back. More most recently was last year, last December, we
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.640]   came. And we had that Christmas experience. We went to the
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.360]   Christmas markets. You know, it was it's just wonderful. Like, I
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.600]   don't think there's a bad time. But I think there is a better
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.280]   time. And so that's a very optimistic way of looking at
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.400]   it. Yeah, so and let's talk generally about the regions. I
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.120]   think people know Paris, whether they've been there or not.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.520]   They've obviously seen in the movies. I think I've done a
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.440]   disservice to the country of France by spending too much of
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.160]   my travels to Paris, and then some in the south. But even I
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.640]   feel like I need a little bit of an education on high level, what
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.960]   are the kinds of regions of places people might want to
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.760]   consider going to outside of Paris?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.800]   Well, you have the Loire Valley, which is very green, very
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.120]   fairytale esque, known for a chateau known for its incredible
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.080]   diversity of wines. Also, if you're someone who happens to be
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   interested in natural wine, it was sort of like the birthplace
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.320]   of natural wine in France. So there are a lot of very
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.080]   interesting producers. You have Burgundy, which is sort of the
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.800]   the the next great spot to be right now. Especially if you
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:18.560]   like wine. There's a whole wine route that you can take, that
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.800]   really leads you through sort of the key towns, winemaking towns
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.960]   in Burgundy. Then you have, you know, Alsace, which is on the
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.800]   border with Germany. And you know, Strasbourg is the is the
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.960]   key city there. And it's very picturesque. It's really
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.560]   lovely. Christmas is a particularly like the end of
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.920]   your holiday is obviously a very, very sort of. It's
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.400]   amazing. I forgot that I had been there until you just said
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.520]   that. Oh, my gosh, we went there for the holidays. It's so
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.200]   charming. My wife is the word we go back. And Paris, honestly,
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.600]   when you compare the Paris way of celebrating the end of year
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.040]   to what happens in Strasbourg, you're like the Parisians
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   depressed because they're, you know, the level of festivity is
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.480]   very tame. So. So, you know, that's that's that. But it's
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.120]   also beautiful right now, too. It's very green. Brittany, as I
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.960]   mentioned before, very wild, very, you know, obviously
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.720]   incredible seafood, beautiful towns. Then you have Normandy,
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.640]   which is sort of like almost between Brittany and and Ile de
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.520]   France, the region where Paris is. And you have, you know, the
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.200]   D-Day beaches, you have lots of beautiful small towns, you have
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.280]   the you can you can go to the ocean. And then on a completely
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.400]   different register, you have the Basque Coast, the western
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.160]   southwestern France, almost getting down into northern
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.200]   Spain, where you have San Sebastian and Bilbao. And so a
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.600]   lot of people will do that route. Actually, they'll fly
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.520]   into maybe Biarritz and visit Bayonne, Biarritz, Saint-Jean
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.120]   de Luz. There are also big surf towns, which is really quite
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.920]   special. If you're into that kind of like, you know, ocean
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.000]   sport kind of adventure, but also very good food and then
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.520]   heading down even further into the into Spanish Basque
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.720]   country. Obviously, you mentioned Provence, but you
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.600]   have Provence sort of like south where Marseille and Avignon is
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.160]   and then you have the Riviera south, which is very, you know,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.080]   very glitzy, very glam. I don't love all of it. I think some of
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.880]   it is very overly sceny. Saint-Tropez is like my least
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.560]   favorite place in France, just like Cannes. I think they're
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.280]   completely overrated. But if you have a lot of money to spend, I
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.920]   would say between the two go to Saint-Tropez because there's
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.520]   some absolutely spectacular hotels. But as a general rule,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   like they're not, they kind of let you down. They're kind of
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.280]   like the Vegas of France in some ways. And then the Alps, I mean,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.000]   gosh, some of the some of the most incredible experiences I've
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.760]   had were in the mountains and not only in the winter when
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.720]   there's snow. So you know, I've been to areas around Mugev during
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.360]   the summer and done amazing hikes. And then you go back in
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.280]   this in the in the winter. And yes, like a lot of Europe,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.160]   there's less and less snow during the winter to for proper
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.040]   skiing. And so that's, again, another environmental reality.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   But the benefit of someplace like Mugev is that it's lower
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.200]   altitude. And so even if you can't do like incredible have
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.760]   the incredible ski slope experience, you have at least a
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.560]   village and another vibe that's quite special with the chalets
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   and you can go snowshoeing. So you don't there's just like
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.280]   whatever you want to do in this country, you can probably do it
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.440]   and have very different cuisine along the way.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.200]   I'm glad you mentioned cuisine because that's kind of like a
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.720]   core tenant of my style of travel. But before we go too far
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.960]   down that path, I'm thinking, gosh, you just described like, I
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.560]   don't know, 10 trips, realistically. No, and that's a
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.960]   good thing, right? Like, all I can think about now is we should
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.280]   probably just move there for a few months. Like, why not? And
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.720]   what I want to know is, okay, so someone's now like, wow, it's
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.240]   gonna take this trip. Is Paris a must add on a trip if you
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.760]   haven't been or I mean, you live there, like should someone even
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.320]   you didn't mention it, I assume because I mentioned, you know,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.160]   we said, outside of Paris, but
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.680]   to me, it's like inconceivable not to come to Paris at least
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.560]   once, because I think it's so important, even if for sort of a
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.400]   generalized understanding of France and how it functions, for
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.280]   better or for worse, it's a country that has been that has
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   centered everything around Paris, really. And that has to
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:49.000]   do with the way the way the monarchy was, the way the royal
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.800]   court had set things up the way that they perceived sort of the
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.040]   set the not only the economic center, but the cultural center
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.200]   of the of the country was necessarily in Paris. And so
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.000]   they kind of still have this weird thing where it's like
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.080]   Paris is the is the is the is the golden child, and then
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.960]   everywhere else is sort of like, you know, the rest of France.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.760]   Obviously, people don't view it that way, on an everyday level,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.600]   but you do get the sense, especially when you're going to
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.800]   museums, and you're, and you're digging into that history on a
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.400]   visit to Paris, you see how important Paris has always been,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.280]   you know, in the US, obviously, you have, you know, the the
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.160]   former, the original colonies that were were super important,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.000]   New York, Philadelphia, Virginia, okay. But Paris is
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.400]   like on another level. And so I think for you to contextualize
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.560]   the way the country functions, and of course, if that's
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.880]   interesting to you, I mean, I think it's kind of crucial to
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.160]   have an understanding of a, of a country, if you're going to
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.240]   visit, you know, and go beyond just sort of like, again,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.640]   checking off a list, but really getting under the surface of a
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.160]   place, it's helpful to at least know, whether it's in a day or
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.400]   two have had some sort of experience that contextualizes
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.440]   Paris and the rest of and the rest of France, and just from a
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   cultural, historical, architectural perspective, and a
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.520]   culinary perspective, like, you'd be missing out, you'd be
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.760]   missing out on a truly exceptional and fascinating and
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.280]   dynamic experience by overlooking Paris.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.080]   I don't disagree having been there plenty of times, and we're
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.000]   going to spend some time on Paris. I imagine it's also
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.040]   probably true that I imagine the average person's not gonna be
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.560]   able to go to all the places you mentioned. If you want to try
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.640]   the cuisines of those places, I imagine Paris is the place
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.680]   outside of any region to find exposure to other other styles
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.200]   in life and food in one place.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.720]   That's very true. I'd say maybe the the place where you have
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   maybe the or sorry, the city or the the destination that is
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.960]   maybe least represented in Paris is Marseille and that's a that's
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.080]   a whole other breed unto itself. But cities like Paris and even
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   Lyon, you can probably find, you know, a fair amount of all the
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   other regional cuisines to varying degrees of, you know,
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.800]   excellence and expertise. But no, honestly, Paris is the ideal
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.280]   place to get that exposure.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.000]   So if someone's coming for you, like you said, two weeks would
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.880]   be great. Let's assume they've got, you know, 1014 days. Paris
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.720]   is in there. How many days do you think, you know, you could
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.560]   obviously spend all two weeks there. But if you're trying to
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.000]   help someone think about constructing their their kind of
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.320]   two week itinerary to France, how would you think about
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.920]   breaking it out? And, you know, of all the places you just
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   mentioned, are there some highlights you think are great
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.240]   for a first trip?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.360]   Well, you know, the the feedback I get from people is that, you
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.560]   know, if they fly directly into Paris, it makes sense to sort
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.600]   of start there, get acclimated, take your time, you know, it's a
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.320]   great place to just sort of walk around. So if you're if you're
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.400]   heavily jet lagged, and you're sort of gearing up for maybe
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.040]   even a more active trip in the next places you're going, it's
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.560]   good to sort of ease in with Paris. And you know, if you're
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.480]   if it's a lot easier to adjust, if you know, all you have to do
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.520]   is walk out your apartment or hotel door and you know, stumble
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.960]   upon a restaurant, you don't have to go very far. In other
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.840]   words, to sort of get yourself get yourself going when you
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.160]   arrive. So I would say spending a handful of days at least three
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.640]   or at least four days in Paris would be ideal to be honest,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.400]   before making making your way elsewhere. And I think for a
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.800]   first time visitor, it makes it honestly makes sense to do one
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.440]   of two things going to Normandy because of the sort of cultural
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.040]   awareness that exists, especially if you're you know,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.600]   if you're someone who had family active in the war, Normandy is
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.560]   sort of like, kind of a crucial stopping point. And even if
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   you're not interested in in in sort of the World War Two
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:03.360]   experience, you, you have such beautiful landscapes, such
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.320]   incredible food that it would, it would make sense as sort of
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.360]   like, this is this is still relatively close to Paris, I can
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.840]   drive, I could take a train, I could experience some things.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.920]   And then either come back to Paris or move on from there. But
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   I think it's a good sort of first step outside of Paris, or
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.800]   skipping that and going directly to the south of France, because
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.760]   you know, that's sort of one of the other iconic experiences,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   and something that is so very different from the Parisian
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   experience. So if the idea is you're going to sort of mix the
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.720]   vibes during your trip, you know, being by the Mediterranean
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.560]   is is honestly spectacular and, and and opens up a whole other
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.120]   world in terms of understanding France and how it functions.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.480]   Certainly, if you're more of an outdoorsy person, I would say,
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.280]   you know, going from Paris to Provence or Paris to the
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   mountains would make great sense, because there's so much
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.080]   you can do, whether it's, you know, like I said, summer or
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.160]   winter. And, and I would say that the Basque country is
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.080]   probably better for people who have been a few times only
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.160]   because it's, it's a it's a very different experience. It's it's
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.760]   more like the people who go to Portugal, I think, and go, you
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   know, surfing in in seaside towns in Portugal, or accustomed
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.320]   to surfing in California. That's kind of the vibe there. And I
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.960]   don't know that you're getting sort of Yes, it's a it's a sort
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.480]   of a true French experience. But I don't think on a first trip
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.640]   that that's, that's sort of the introduction I would I would
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.280]   recommend. Okay, I want to get to the south of France places
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.560]   because you mentioned a few not to go but let's pause for a
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.360]   second there. Any places you think that someone might be
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.520]   hearing about when they're planning their trip that are
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.640]   kind of overhyped, or maybe kind of emerging and
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.200]   underappreciated? I would say still Britney remains like very
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:07.360]   there's sort of like a cursory kind of coverage that exists
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.760]   around Britney for whatever reason, Britney in the Basque
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   country, honestly, those are the two places. So again, all on the
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:18.120]   sort of Western, all the western coast of France that for
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.960]   whatever reason, I think maybe just in the being in the shadow
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.880]   of some of these more cinematic places, don't get the kind of
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.040]   exposure that they deserve, but they are magnificent. And
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.680]   honestly, they especially in Britney, you'll feel like you're
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.800]   you know, there's probably more in common with like, the Isle of
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:43.320]   Jersey and and and like the experience on the on the English
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.640]   coast than with else other places in France. So it has this
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.200]   very wild, very natural, totally other other worldly almost
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.120]   experience that it that it that it offers and the landscapes are
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.640]   just absolutely breathtaking. And it deserves to be, I think,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.520]   more frequented by by foreigners, simply because it's
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.560]   also very, it's one of the few places that remains pretty cool
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.400]   even during the summer. So we have the heat wave, it's sort of
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.920]   like always the one place we look on the map to be like,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.240]   okay, what was the max temperature in Britney in the
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.040]   week of heat wave, and it usually is the only place in the
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.080]   entire country that is like, acceptable, like summer
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.720]   acceptable.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.920]   So maybe a good place to add on if it's a hot summer.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.280]   Absolutely.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   And finally, any mistakes you think people make when they're
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.520]   planning their trip that you're like, hey, just before we get
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.080]   into any more details, don't do XYZ.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.840]   One of the things that is, I mean, this is a common American
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.160]   trait, I think is packing like five suitcases and trying to
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.880]   then go a whole number of places and have to drag this all this
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.120]   stuff along. And I think that it does that it does a disservice
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.880]   because accommodations are almost always smaller than what
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.040]   they're used to in the States. And that must be true in other
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.400]   countries like Australia, where things are just bigger. And then
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.600]   trying to then take all that stuff and go to too many places
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   in one trip. I think people are like, I need to maximize my
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   time, I get like two seconds of vacation. I get it. But think
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   smaller. Think about ease of travel. Think about, you know,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.600]   this is a very old country. France is very old, much older
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.920]   than perhaps where you're from. And and the infrastructure tends
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.200]   to be narrower. And so when you come on your trip with 70
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.640]   suitcases full of stuff you don't need, or won't even, you
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.040]   know, remove from the suitcase, it seems like you're just sort
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.240]   of carrying dead weight. And that's going to be something you
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.320]   have to drag to every place you go. So sort of this combo of
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.920]   like overpacking and overpacking your trip with too many
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.720]   destinations.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.040]   I think there's something that it's even it's taken me as
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.760]   someone who likes to save money, time to process. But there are
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.280]   some countries where you can't buy a lot of things that you
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.400]   might be accustomed to. France is not one of those countries.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   So, you know, even the simple thing, like, we don't we don't
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.720]   buy diapers, like you could go buy like, there's a lot of
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.240]   things you didn't bring a jacket because you didn't think it was
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.520]   gonna get that cold. There are lots of places that you can go
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.200]   buy a jacket, you know, other things. So it's not a country
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.020]   where it's hard to augment what you packed. And so I would say,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.780]   keep that in mind, as you're thinking about how much you
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.860]   actually need to bring.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.620]   Also, I have to add this because this is a common thing that
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.820]   comes up. I mean, even from my own father, who was like
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.140]   baffled when I was like, you do not need dress shoes. We're not
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.700]   going to like, a two or three Michelin star restaurant, every
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.460]   single person who comes to Paris or almost anywhere in this
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.420]   country wear sneakers or I mean, it's like a sneaker culture now.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.180]   So this idea that you have to have this excessively formal
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.740]   wear to go out to a restaurant means you're packing lots of
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.380]   stuff you don't need because that is just not the way people
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:00.940]   go out.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.780]   And I will even say, I have been to one, two or three Michelin
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.580]   star restaurant in France. And I didn't bring a jacket and they
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.940]   had jackets to borrow. Yeah, it was like, it didn't fit
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.860]   perfectly. But I met the requirement without having to
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.060]   pack a jacket. Right. And so even that there is sometimes
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.020]   ways to skirt around that requirement.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.540]   Totally. It's very rare to get turned away at this point,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.740]   because there's usually sort of a solution. But, but the footwear
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.580]   in particular, since that adds a lot of weight to your your
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.180]   suitcase, I just want to be like, go go easy on the like
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.220]   fancy footwear, you won't need it.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   All right. Well, so that brings to a kind of another section of
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.780]   kind of the people, the culture. You talked about, you know,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.540]   slowing down, it's where you might meet people. Let's talk a
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.540]   little bit. How do you describe the culture? I think France has
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.140]   a bit of a reputation in some people's minds for attitude and
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.380]   and and people talk about like, what you've experienced, you've
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.660]   lived there 16 years, like what, how would you describe the
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.940]   people in the culture in France?
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.700]   This is a this is a overall a people that are very curious,
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:10.980]   very cultured, very, very in tune with the land, I'd say the
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.180]   average person knows probably more about, you know, like, food
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.780]   and where it comes from, then then other people I've met, or
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.580]   that I grew up with, they tend to lean quite intellectual, a
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.940]   little bit philosophical, they, yes, they have, they can have a
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.460]   bit of an attitude, they can have a bit of a cynical outlook
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.180]   on on life. And I think part of that has to do with sort of
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.460]   falling from greatness, historically, you know, like you
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.780]   have the you were the great superpower, you had the kings,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.820]   then you had the revolution. And, you know, and then from
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.900]   there, you also had, you know, de Gaulle, who who told you we
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.220]   were great, you know, that they were great people. And, and then
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.860]   you sort of slide out of being the sort of superpower, and they
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.940]   have a lot of soft power, obviously, I mean, this is the
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.980]   culture that produces and exports that a staggering number
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:07.060]   of of high end products, right from from this incredible
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.460]   artisanal know how when it comes to fashion and handbags and, and
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.860]   food products, and, you know, sort of all sorts of things, but
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.660]   it's no longer the diplomatic or political power that it used to
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.460]   be. And so I think some of that is like they, they have this bit
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.940]   of a chip on their shoulder of like, well, we were historically
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.940]   great and powerful. And I think that's something that comes into
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.460]   play quite a lot, especially as I often analyze, like, the way
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.260]   the politics works here, and the way people perceive some of
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.860]   their rights, and that they should always have them or not
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.980]   have them or, you know, whatever, all the debates that
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:45.540]   exist on, on, on sort of what they should or shouldn't be be
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.580]   given with, you know, without any any fight, I think all leads
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.140]   back to sort of their trajectory as a culture as a country. So
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.020]   they're very proud people, obviously, they have a lot to be
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.140]   proud about, they've contributed a great number of artistic and
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.060]   gastronomic innovations in the world, but also architecturally,
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.220]   I mean, Paris, in particular, was was a complete innovator
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.540]   when it came to urban planning within Europe in the, you know,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.020]   what the 17th and 18th century. So I think that's that narrative
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.340]   or the perspective of Paris and France as sort of this global
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.820]   innovator kind of got lost along the way, because other cultures
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.860]   sort of picked up the picked up the pace or, you know, out
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.460]   innovated them. But, but this is a culture that I think is very
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.100]   proud of all the things that that the that its people, its
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.260]   minds, its greatest minds have have done for the world. And
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.380]   also, it's a culture that I think struggles with certainly
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.860]   some of the ills of its past. I mean, what other culture? What
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.660]   other country? I mean, is there any other country that has sort
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.420]   of like properly come to terms with their past? Probably not.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   But this is like an ongoing part of their existence. And you get
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.100]   that sense that, you know, they're still grappling with
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.060]   some things. And depending on where you go, that'll be more or
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.900]   less palpable. But you know, I'm sure some of your listeners will
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.220]   have heard or seen videos of the protests that we had in, you
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.860]   know, since the beginning of the year on the pension reform. And
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.100]   like, you can't dissociate something like that happening
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.620]   and, and the and the outpouring of, you know, passionate
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:33.220]   critique or resistance. You can't associate that with the
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.980]   way the culture functions overall. I mean, this is a they
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.780]   fight for their rights. And that's quite admirable. And if
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.980]   that means that, like, you know, your route to a museum gets
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.740]   disrupted, like, yeah, that's, that's kind of part of what you
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.500]   come for, in a way you're seeing a people that are really still
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.460]   fighting for the rights that they they want to protect and
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.300]   the rights that they feel that they still deserve. And and I
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.700]   think you feel that in a way that you might not feel it to
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.020]   the same extent in other European nations.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.380]   And is it easy to meet people? Right? That's a good background
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.220]   on kind of who they are. But what kind of local experiences
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.580]   when it comes to personal interactions? Do you think, you
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.660]   know, American or foreign or traveling to France can expect?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.700]   I think as long as you're comfortable or not comfortable,
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.700]   but at least willing to engage with locals, they'll, they'll
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.620]   engage with you. I mean, if you if you try to speak a few words
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.620]   in French, you know, just to be like, you know, hey, I can't,
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.660]   you know, I speak very little French, I speak English, can I
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.420]   talk to you in English, and then you go from there, like, and
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   then you engage them on whatever they're drinking, or, you know,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.260]   what they recommend in the neighborhood, people are warm,
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.980]   people want to have that engagement with people, with
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:53.780]   with travelers. And I think the problem arises when you when
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.980]   travelers sort of assume that they need to be sort of
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.340]   experience the sitting city alongside or city or country,
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.020]   whatever, alongside of the people, but without actually
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.940]   trying to connect with them. I think that that does a
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.820]   disservice to the experience. And then you're missing
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.060]   something that's sort of integral to the experience. And
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.820]   it could be as simple as like, you know, let's say you're
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.340]   having a wine tasting in Burgundy, and you're like, you
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.580]   know what, I'd love to know what you recommend, where do you go
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.900]   when you're not at work? Or where do you go when you're you
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.940]   know, with your family, trying to get a sense of their version
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   of the place. And it usually allows them to relax, and it
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.660]   gives them the chance to sort of provide for your trip, you
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.860]   know, if they can make a difference in your trip, that
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.460]   sort of is a is a gift to them. And so I get the sense that
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.420]   there's this this love of sharing that you just need to
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.900]   tap into, but it's there.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.020]   I never thought about this until just this moment. But there's
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.060]   such a stark difference between asking someone like, where's
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.180]   the best x versus what do you think the best x is? And it
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.780]   seems like a strategy, maybe anywhere in the world, but
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.580]   especially in France might be to make all of your conversations
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.620]   very personal to the person you're talking to.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.420]   You nailed it. That is exactly what it is. I mean, the French
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.540]   want to feel like you're you're inquiring them because it's
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.700]   them. And not just that they happen to be a body that lives
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.380]   in proximity to some other stuff. And I think I think
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.820]   that's a that's an accurate way of assessing what they
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.380]   appreciate, just like they don't expect you to be fluent, you
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.460]   don't need to like get bent out of shape that you can't have a
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.780]   full on conversation with them. But they do really appreciate
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.060]   you trying, whether it's with just the sort of salutations or
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.980]   asking, you know, where's the bathroom like, just try
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.540]   any topics that if you find yourself at a bar having a
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.900]   conversation that you're like, just just don't bring these
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.380]   things up. They don't lead lend well, you know, to a
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.580]   conversation in France.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.180]   I think talk about wealth is very taboo, especially given the
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.900]   disparities that exist between the you know, sort of the old
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.820]   ultra wealthy and the far less wealthy. I would say, stay
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.140]   clear of politics. I mean, if you ask people about about the
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.340]   president. I mean, you're not you don't live in the country.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.620]   So you know, you don't have that much of a maybe a stake, but it
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.100]   can get kind of heated. And I think then you run the risk of
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.860]   them asking, especially if you're from the US, that will
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.100]   veer right back into sort of our or the American political
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.060]   system. And if that's not something you're really in the
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.540]   mood to start debating, then like just keep politics off the
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.020]   table.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.940]   Okay, I like it. And we haven't talked a little bit about, you
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.740]   know, broadly people and who it makes sense to travel with. We
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.900]   went with kids. How is France easy for someone with lots of
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   children to travel around? We were only in Paris. But let's
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.300]   talk about the people are people warm and welcoming to children
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.660]   being around? What's your perspective?
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.460]   They absolutely can be warm and welcoming to children. However,
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.140]   if you know that you have children who are like really
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.980]   ill behaved, just good luck, because the French are not going
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.340]   to hold back. If you're on a train and your kids are going
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.060]   absolutely ballistic, you'll hear from some people who are
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.660]   like, you know, you're disturbing us, you need to get a
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.580]   hold on your kids. And it won't be in the way that I think, you
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.140]   know, like, again, I can only speak to Americans, but the way
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.660]   the Americans tend to handle those kinds of situations, but
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.060]   they'll, they'll give you like horrible side eye, they might
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.300]   scoff at you, they might also if they're older, they might
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:30.180]   definitely try to like, parent for you. And I just think, you
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.860]   know, there are certain places given there's a lot going on,
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.060]   especially in a city like Paris, there are a lot of people,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.860]   there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of people trying to move
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.620]   quickly. No, we're not quite like New York. But you know,
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.340]   people are still trying to go, you know, get to where they need
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.460]   to go. And if you're traveling with like a bunch of kids, and
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.340]   they're rowdy, and you don't have a hold on them. Yeah, I
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.500]   think that's going to be it's going to be stressful for
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.700]   everyone, yourself included. I also think that in Paris,
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.180]   especially you don't see a lot of very, very young kids at
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.540]   restaurants, I think parents tend to hear, you know, they
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.500]   take them out to the parks, they go to kid focused places. And
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.140]   maybe during the day, they'll take their kid to a cafe for a
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.220]   you know, a snack or a hot chocolate or something. But in
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.980]   the evening, that tends to be sort of like parents time. So
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.060]   almost all of my friends who have kids, it's extremely rare
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.860]   that they go out with their children to dinner. So that
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.940]   might mean, if you're really looking to have a special meal
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.660]   without the kids, maybe you need to have a plan for a babysitter.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.060]   And there are, you know, locals and resources where you can
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.740]   figure figure that out. Or maybe you have an older child who can
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.900]   watch the younger child, I don't know. But it's totally possible
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.220]   in Paris is really all of France's, it can be super fun
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.620]   with kids. But just know that it depends on your children. And I
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.780]   think you need to be honest with yourself about what kind of kids
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.260]   you have.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.020]   Yeah, I will say we went out to dinner, almost exclusively with
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:59.140]   a six month old and a two year old. And you know, we're, we're
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.380]   greeted warmly. So
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.860]   they must be very well behaved, too.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:08.780]   I would say as well behaved as children that age could be. But
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:13.580]   but it went pretty well. So great. And then what about food?
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.020]   Let's talk right before we get I want to go into Paris and then
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.180]   rest of the country, but high level. Are there culinary
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.300]   experiences that people need to be having on any trip to France
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.220]   specific ones?
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:28.580]   What I would say is that people who come to Paris specifically,
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.300]   because Paris is really the place where you're going to
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.580]   have you could have like a whole host of culinary experiences,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.540]   some of which, you know, are traditionally French, and then
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.100]   the rest are a very modern interpretation of what it means
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.340]   to eat in Paris today. And that might be blended with Southeast
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.060]   Asian food, it might be blended with Mediterranean cuisine, and
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.900]   Mediterranean cuisine could mean from sort of the Levantine parts
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:02.220]   of the world to the Italian and French coast. So it really
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.540]   depends on what you're you're sort of looking for, I would
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   say, get it, if you're going to go to a place like Paris, if
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.260]   you're going to go to a place like Marseille, where there are
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.420]   multiple cultural influences, it behooves you to sort of say, I'm
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.980]   going to have some very classically French bistro
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.980]   experiences, I might have a neo bistro experience, which is very
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.740]   contemporary, very inventive, very market driven. And I'm also
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:28.700]   going to have some of the other kinds of diasporic cuisines that
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.140]   are very present in these places, because they sort of all
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.620]   make up the fabric of the place. And I think that's the that's
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.260]   the important thing to keep in mind. Obviously, when you go to
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:42.540]   regions that are, you know, haven't really expanded their
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.580]   international influences, it makes sense to, you know, to go
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.060]   with whatever is there, places where it's very seafood heavy,
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.620]   and it's all very local, and you know, whatever the local
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.540]   vegetables are, like, do that, have that experience. But, but
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.820]   but certainly, like you mentioned, which was a which was
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.420]   a great point, if you have limited time, and you're not
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.580]   going to get to a lot of regions, there's quite a lot of
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.180]   of choice in Paris alone, to have sort of a smattering of
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.420]   those regional flavors.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.460]   That's great. And is there a source someone could use,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.180]   whether it's an app, a site to find, you know, reliably good
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.380]   ratings or places to eat? I don't think at least my
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.780]   experience TripAdvisor is not that. What do the locals use to
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.140]   is it just word of mouth?
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:35.660]   It's word of mouth, but also we use le fooding. So it's le and
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.500]   then fooding. And they they they're sort of like, I don't
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   know what to call them. They're sort of like, a little bit more
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:48.900]   of a niche eater calm, maybe. That's in English as well. And
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.580]   so if you type in, let's say, obviously, Paris is super
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.740]   represented, Marseille, the big cities. But if you even type in,
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.740]   like, I'm going to Megev, which is obviously a much smaller,
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.340]   smaller destination, they too will probably have a few
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.380]   recommendations. So I would say it's a it's sort of a, it's a
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.300]   gauge of quality. Also kind of vibe, I think, you know, the
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.060]   places that end up in le fooding are both good and also have a
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:22.500]   certain atmosphere. And and I think that for to have a little
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.460]   bit more of an insidery pool of suggestions, that's a better
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.860]   idea than getting, you know, like Joe from whatever city in
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.780]   America who said he liked this place that he found randomly,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.460]   like, I don't know, you know, that's that's the difficulty
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.940]   with TripAdvisor and places that sort of just accumulate traveler
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.820]   opinions. I mean, I think if you're looking for where the
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.180]   locals go, definitely go to a site that is run also by by
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.420]   locals and local journalists. I would say Instagram can be
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.300]   helpful as well. And if you're looking, you know, specifically
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.500]   for Paris, like I have my own digital guide to Paris, I also,
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.180]   you know, obviously wrote a book, but the the more updated
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:09.060]   version is a digital sort of, yeah, it's like a PDF you get,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.420]   and you can use it and you can put things on your Google Map,
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.980]   there is a connected Google Map. And so there are people who do
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.300]   that, which I think is helpful. If you're looking, if you, if
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.460]   you sort of sense that someone is a trustworthy voice, you
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.900]   know, they might have something already built in for you to
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.180]   either use or purchase or whatever, that could give you
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.780]   kind of a whittled down but sharp, curated list of places to
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.860]   eat. And then if you're obviously a Michelin person,
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.660]   that's, you know, if you're looking for sort of the fine
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:42.100]   dining, I mean, that remains still like a, you know, a very
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.580]   acceptable guide to planning your your eating, it's just, you
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.740]   know, might empty your wallet after a while.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.740]   Well, your guide is fantastic. I'm going to link to that in the
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.180]   show notes, people can check that out and know where to get
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:59.260]   it. Couple logistic things. timing, what time do people eat?
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.020]   Do you need reservations? Any kind of logistical guides for
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:03.500]   eating?
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.540]   Yes. So depending on where you go, I mean, obviously, it can
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.580]   vary. But for the most part, you're not really going to be
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.220]   with other people until at least seven, 730. Seven is super
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.860]   early, that's like almost early bird here. There are a few
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.700]   places that do all day service, you know, sort of like the
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.940]   nonstop groceries, but that that only gives you a certain type of
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.260]   food, obviously, like it's, it's, it's like, a small
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.980]   percentage of, you know, your options. So don't don't figure
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.460]   that you're going to have, you know, an ambience and get to
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.980]   start eating before 738. In other parts of France, you know,
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.540]   that might be a little bit, you know, there might be second
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.580]   seatings that are at 9pm. But for the most part, especially
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.540]   when you get into small towns, it's probably going to be 730.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.620]   And they stop serving at 10 or 1030. So I think you need to
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.020]   keep that in mind if you need an afternoon snack. Also, the other
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.500]   thing people sometimes forget is that they don't necessarily
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.580]   serve lunch everywhere through the entire afternoon. So you
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.900]   know, if it opens at 12 or 1230 for lunch, it may close by 3pm
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.860]   for lunch service. So that's something you definitely need to
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:20.500]   plan and in big cities with, you know, some, some pretty, pretty
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.780]   trendy or just like generally really beloved establishments
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.420]   reserving ahead is better. But if you arrive and you're in a
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.140]   hotel, and you speak to your concierge, you know, they can
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.220]   also try to help get you in so that you don't need to
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.820]   completely plan everything in advance. My general
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.260]   recommendation is try to book a few things, and then leave the
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.740]   rest up to sort of improv.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.460]   In some places, I find that if you see a place that looks
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.060]   crowded, and it looks like it's not a bunch of tourists, it's
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   probably a good spot. Yeah, worry about it. Is that advice
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.660]   apply that usually bears out? I mean, popular could also mean
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.220]   though that depending on the time of day could mean you're
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.180]   in an area with a lot of companies and people are on
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.940]   their lunch break, and they go to a certain place because it's
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:09.300]   convenient, inexpensive, and fine, but like, maybe wouldn't
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.460]   be great in the evening. So and that's not something you're
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.180]   necessarily going to know if you don't really know a city and
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.940]   sort of where the business districts are. But for the most
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.780]   part, yeah, I mean, if you if you don't get the sense that
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.860]   it's like all English speaking, by the same token, there are a
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.900]   bunch of very excellent restaurants in Paris, for
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.660]   example, where there are, because they've been written
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.100]   about so much, they actually have a largely English speaking
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:36.500]   clientele, but are also good. So it depends if you want to have
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.780]   that, you know, that chef or those owners experience while
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.860]   also being seated with other English speakers. To me, it's
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.500]   like, only a thing on occasion I'll do because, you know, if
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.060]   I'm really into trying or supporting that, that, you know,
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.260]   chef or restaurant owner, but I do find it a bit jarring to be
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.900]   in a place, you know, where like, potentially, maybe my
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.460]   husband and I are the only ones speaking French. So in general,
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.060]   I personally, when I travel, try to avoid those scenarios.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.140]   Because I'm never going to really do the research to find
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.420]   out. But like, is it really worth me going, you know, like,
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   that's already a bit off putting.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.460]   Okay, you mentioned Paris. So let's let's dive in, because I
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:18.980]   want to make sure we get to some some details. You know, Paris
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.300]   incredibly well, you've written books about Paris in multiple
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.260]   languages. It's it's impressive. Let's talk about someone
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.940]   planning there. You said, you know, at least three or four
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.740]   could be a week, days in Paris.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:35.780]   Well, in terms of staying, I think the the first question to
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.980]   ask is what neighborhood do you really want to be planted in?
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.300]   Because that can determine the rest of your, your itinerary,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.980]   essentially, I mean, no, nothing is really that far to get to.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.860]   And if you're going to use public transport, I mean, you
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.900]   could be on the in the 11th arrondissement where I live and
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.340]   still, you know, go to the Fondation Louis Vuitton, which
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.300]   is, you know, on the western extremities of the city. So it's
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.900]   not it's not impossible. But I think you need to know sort of
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.380]   what you what you're going to do the most of. Are you going to be
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.500]   going to a lot of museums? Are you really keen on being near
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.820]   the river that would dictate sort of what neighborhoods I
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.500]   would recommend to you. And once you've narrowed down what
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.180]   neighborhood you want to be in, and then you can go into sort
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.820]   of, okay, do you want an apartment, Airbnbs are getting
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.580]   way more expensive. At this point, some people think that
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:24.460]   hotels are back to being sort of the greatest value. And you can
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.460]   also get a lot of boutique hotels, which are really, you
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.220]   know, really charming, really interesting, great views, great
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:35.420]   services, and put you sort of in the heart of the action. I, you
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.220]   know, I know a lot of people who stay in the in the St Germain
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.300]   area, because it's like, you know, it's, it's close to a lot
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.540]   of things. It's good. It's near the river. It's very charming.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:50.500]   It's very picturesque. But for the best food experiences, it's
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:55.940]   it's it's not there. So I think the person who's planning needs
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.980]   to think like, okay, am I the food traveler who really just
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.020]   wants to go to all the best restaurants, in which case
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.540]   there's a huge concentration of them in eastern Paris. Maybe
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.660]   it's best I stay sort of right bank over by bestie or near
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:17.620]   Oberkampf or, or in the Marais, at least, you know, because at
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.980]   least that is, you know, sort of getting you closer. If that's
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.340]   not your thing, and you really are like, I want to go antique
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.180]   shopping and go to museums and be in the pure center of the
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.900]   city, then I'd say yeah, you could stay in the first, you
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.660]   could stay in the sixth, you could stay in the fifth. But it
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.020]   might not be the most sort of like dynamic in the evening.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.900]   Generally, I think that the seventh is one of the more
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.820]   boring places to stay. It's very sleepy. It's very residential.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.300]   So yes, that's closer to the Eiffel Tower. But like, you
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.900]   don't need to seat in your backyard to have a, you know, a
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.020]   wonderful experience.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.620]   I just realized we both have been to Paris, you've lived
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.340]   there 16 years, I've been there a bunch. For anyone who doesn't
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.140]   know, Paris is structured with about about how many like a
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:07.420]   snail, it's a snail 20 hour on these mall. Yes. Circle around
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.540]   from the center. So one being dead center going clockwise
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.900]   around 20. So just if you hear if you hear references to the
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.260]   seventh and the fifth, there, you could just search Paris map
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.220]   and you'll see all of these numbers highlighting the
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:25.140]   regions. Yes, it's true. I often forget that this is not, you
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:29.420]   know, the most common knowledge. I take that for granted. So good
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.740]   thing you reminded people. You know, at the end of the day, if
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.060]   you're like, I struggled to find a place and this is what I could
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.700]   find. And it was in the 15,000 D small, you'll be fine. And
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.820]   you'll probably have a really lovely experience. But it's not
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.860]   ideal, right? So there are just neighborhoods where you're going
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.500]   to get really like you're in the get the sense that you're in the
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.340]   heart of things that you're close to things that, you know,
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.660]   you could be it could be practical, given the type of
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.820]   trip you want to have.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.060]   Is there a place that you'd put if you're like, I want to have,
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.900]   I want to feel like I'm staying somewhere where I'm surrounded
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.260]   by locals, I'm having a local experience. I'm close enough to
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.340]   things, but I'm okay trekking to the sites. I'm okay trekking to
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.500]   the best restaurants. But I just kind of want like a fun,
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:15.060]   interesting neighborhood with, you know, good cafe, I can go
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.580]   relax, but just feel like I'm not in the in the mix of it. Is
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.100]   there a place you'd you'd throw out?
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.740]   Yeah, I would say, my part of town, you know, you could you
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.660]   could you could stay near. It's funny, because we tend to think
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.180]   of things in terms of like their metro neighborhoods. So like
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.540]   Sharon, where there's a lot of good food for those listening
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.980]   who have been here and who might know Paris, it's not far from
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.860]   the restaurant septim, which is, you know, sort of like now,
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:45.020]   totally beloved. You could stay, you could stay in Belleville,
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.740]   which is hugely dynamic and super diverse and super
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.020]   interesting. And that gets you close to a park that I really
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:56.300]   love called the boot show. So either in Belleville, or further
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.500]   up into the 19,000 small would be would be wonderful. And you
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.780]   could easily get on the metro and get right back into the
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.180]   center of the center of things. And then on the flip side, if
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.260]   you want sort of a very calm, calm and quiet experience, then
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:17.180]   yeah, I would say the fifth and sixth, deeper in sort of closer
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.100]   to like Luxembourg gardens is probably going to be more of a
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:25.420]   tranquil, serene, relaxing kind of experience that isn't
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.780]   necessarily, you know, right in the middle, but will be lovely.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.900]   And just to for everyone's awareness, I don't want to go
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.260]   in and say, here are the 50 sites, like we don't need to
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.140]   list off all the the tourist destinations that everyone can
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.140]   find in any guide or anything like that. But I would love to
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.740]   tap on what are what are a few things? Because like you said,
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.580]   we don't want to plan your whole trip for you. We want to just
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.820]   give you some inspiration. Are there a few things in Paris that
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.420]   you think aren't the obvious attractions or activities that
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.300]   someone should put on their list to check out? Maybe they're not
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.740]   good for everyone. But for some people worth sharing?
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:07.500]   Yeah, I think people who are overwhelmed by the Louvre,
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.340]   especially which I know I am. There are plenty of smaller
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.340]   museums. This is sort of the city of smaller museums, and
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.700]   also what you would call a house museum. So sort of the the
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:23.260]   private former private home of a very, you know, prolific writer
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.060]   artist. And there are several that I think are worth visiting
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.520]   the Musee de Montmartre, which is in the 18th. So if you're
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.500]   going to go up toward the Sackraker Cathedral, or
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:38.860]   Basilica in that neighborhood, so the 18th arrondissement,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.980]   that's a fantastic, small, really intimate museum. And I
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.540]   believe they have a nice in inner garden. You also have the
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.380]   Gustave Moreau Museum. And similarly, it's so beautiful.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.780]   It's it's quite small, really inexpensive entry fee, and and
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.060]   is focused on it was the former home of the of the artist
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:03.500]   Gustave Moreau. And so all of it is sort of rewritten, not
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:07.900]   recreated, but sort of frozen in time as though it's how he left
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.420]   it and his works are displayed. And there's this really iconic
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.500]   spiral staircase, it's really beautiful. And that's a much
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.580]   smaller, less overwhelming experience. And then for
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:20.500]   something bigger, but still, still completely worth visiting
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.580]   is the Carnavalet Museum, which is in the Marais, and it's the
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:27.300]   City of Paris Museum, essentially. And so you have all
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.620]   of the works, all of the exhibits are related to the
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.820]   history of Paris. And and that is just sort of a non negotiable
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.460]   for me, but it often doesn't make the list for people when
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.060]   they when they come and they're doing, you know, the Louvre, the
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.620]   Musee d'Orsay and some of the other big classics. And then
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.780]   finally, I would say if you're really into contemporary art,
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.740]   you could go the gallery route, which is a little bit more
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:53.300]   intimidating, and I think a little bit less sort of easy to
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.980]   navigate. Or you could go to the Pinot collection, which is again
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.100]   one of you know, one of France's billionaires who has a private
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.340]   institution, but it's in a really spectacular building
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.700]   quite in the center of city, not not far from the river. That's a
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.660]   that's a that's a very unique experience.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.860]   Yeah, we we because we had kids skipped out on all of the art.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.660]   So I have nothing to add here. But the CitÃ© des Sciences
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.460]   Museum. Oh, for kids. Yeah, that's great. Absolutely. Like,
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.900]   you know, I wish our kids nap schedule allowed us to be there
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.540]   longer, but I will give it a plug there. It might be the best
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.900]   kids science museum I've ever been to, which I can't say I've
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.180]   been to a lot, but it was awesome. The park around it was
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.780]   awesome. Easy to get to. So that's my one plug.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   That's a good plug. And also, I would say, another spot that's
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:47.180]   also very good for adults and kids is the it's called the
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.980]   MusÃ©e de la chasse et la nature. It's the hunting the
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.500]   nature and hunting museum, which sounds like kind of like it
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.860]   could be a little bit grim. But actually, it's super well done.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.700]   It's beautiful. And for kids who are like interested in seeing
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.820]   animals and, you know, paintings of animals in their in the
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.180]   natural environment, that's a good choice or the Natural
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.380]   History Museum, which is in the Jardin des Plantes, which is one
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.700]   of the gardens and there you'll have like, you know, dinosaur
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700]   bones and, and fossils and all sorts of stuff that's like
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.460]   really good for for kids.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.020]   Any other kind of like unique, weird tour kind of stuff,
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.540]   whether it's like at a market or or is that catacombs that or is
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.260]   that just overrated or stuff in that vein? That's maybe not not
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.500]   the museums that we're kind of typically told about, but but
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.700]   kind of cool, maybe other other experiences.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.940]   I do think the catacombs is a really unique experience. You
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.980]   really have to be someone who's not afraid of closed quarters
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.860]   and closed spaces. I think you also sort of have to plan ahead
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.700]   because I know that if you go too late in the afternoon, you
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.540]   may hit a point where they're not actually letting anyone in
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.780]   anymore. And so you just sort of waited in line. It's very cool,
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.540]   though. I mean, I think that's something you're not going to
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.420]   get in a whole lot of cities, other cities. And then beyond
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.620]   that, I think there's some sort of unusual tours you can you can
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.540]   get on that are sort of like, taking you through a specific
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.780]   history. So it might be like, you know, a Paris under the
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:24.100]   occupation or something like a women, the women of Paris tour.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.260]   So there are things that are sort of not necessarily super
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:31.580]   unusual, but just not your general overview kind of
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.100]   experiences that that are, you know, that are worth looking
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:35.460]   into.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.060]   And where where do these good experiences exist? Is Airbnb
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.820]   experiences a place to find them? Is there a better local
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.340]   site? Is there a, you know, a, I don't know, a blog that talks
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:46.980]   about things?
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.460]   No, that's a very good question. I would say, Airbnb experiences,
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.060]   I think are only going to get you so far, they might be okay.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:03:00.900]   But I think they I, for one thing, the problem is that, you
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.260]   know, people don't spend a lot on those. And so you sort of get
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.820]   what you pay for. I think that there are a couple of things you
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.820]   can do if you're interested in in, you know, wine tastings,
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:17.940]   there are a couple of outlets of sort of let me start again. If
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.900]   you're really into wine tastings, for example, there are
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.460]   certain specialists, for example, certain spaces,
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.660]   there's the cave du Louvre, there's cavewoman wines, and she
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.940]   runs different events in her in her wine shop. I think there,
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.020]   you know, you sort of have to be specific when you're looking.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.420]   But if you're looking for a service that has multiple types
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.540]   of tours, or experiences, I think it's good to look at, for
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.260]   example, Context Travel, which is a company that runs
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.180]   experiences and tours in a variety of different cities in
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.780]   the world and have very good docents and very good themes.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.300]   And, you know, I think in general, the quality of the
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.980]   experience is very high. In Paris, specifically, you also
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.700]   have Paris by mouth, which are obviously as the name suggests,
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.740]   food, food focused tours, and then there are a bunch of
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:08.180]   independent smaller run kind of experiences in food. I mean,
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.980]   food is really the the area where we're like, bursting at
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:16.580]   the seams with options. But, but I would say, you know, either
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.700]   you get recommendations from, let's say, like a travel
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.780]   planner, who has connections with certain key guides, or, or,
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.540]   you know, I for one, do a couple of tours upon requests that are
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.180]   based on my book. So but I don't do this full time. So it's sort
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.900]   of like an upon request thing. If you're looking for something
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.500]   you can sort of jump on at last minute, you need to sort of find
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.060]   bigger companies get your guide also has some that I think are
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:47.180]   going to be a little bit more qualitative than than an Airbnb
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.220]   experience. Food keeps coming up as a theme. So I'll just ask
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.420]   you to throw out any places you love that people should just
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.660]   check out. I know, I know there's an unlimited number of
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.860]   places you haven't been to them all. But I bet. I bet you have
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.860]   some places where you're like, here's some some spots that I'd
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.300]   recommend eating at. And I know people love getting the kind of
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.060]   local recommendation. So yeah, I'll give you a couple. Actually
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.900]   in the seventh hour on the small, which I know I kind of
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.460]   disparaged earlier, but like the key place is let me show. And
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:23.860]   that is just truly excellent, consistently. You know, the
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:28.660]   chef owner has been doing it for nearly 20 years. It has an
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:34.060]   incredible vibe. The portions are large there. It's excellent,
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.140]   excellent, excellent food. A bits. There's a bit of a
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:42.380]   southwestern French inflection. Just just really spectacular.
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.620]   Definitely need to book ahead. The other experience I would say
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.300]   is going into the market these on phone Rouge, which is the
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.020]   oldest covered market in Paris, and hitting up some of those
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.740]   stands. But if you want something that's like open all
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:58.020]   day nonstop. There's a stand in particular in the market called
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:05.580]   les enfants du marchÃ©. And it's seafood, good meats, excellent
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.940]   natural wine, like there's a Japanese chef, but it's all
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.220]   French product. It's an incredible vibe. There's a great
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.900]   playlist. And they really run from like noon until the market
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.540]   closes. So, you know, if you stumble in at 4pm, you know, you
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.940]   can at least have something to eat. And it may be the only
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.780]   stand open, but it'll be super fun. And you know, there's like
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.300]   kind of a young, really, really exciting vibe there. And the
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.700]   food, the quality of the food is just spectacular.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.460]   And and there is an excellent park for children right outside.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.700]   Like one or two blocks away. You're right, which we went to.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.180]   And but my advice to parents in the parks, don't be alarmed if
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.500]   the park closes very promptly and very quickly. I think in the
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.180]   US, it's kind of like at night people leave. In France, I've
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.900]   had there was a whistle. And and at the exact moment the park
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:59.140]   closed within maybe one to two minutes, the entire park had
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.220]   vacated, the doors had been locked, and everyone was gone.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.100]   And I was caught off guard thinking, well, the sun's still
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.500]   out, we could just keep playing. It was like, when the park
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.500]   closes, you leave. But that park is right next to that market and
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.060]   was excellent.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.300]   Yeah, the Carol do Tom and there's a there's like a big
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.300]   cultural center over there, too. So that that's a great area to
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.500]   walk around in general. But yeah, I think it's kind of like
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.700]   the guards are like, I got my shift is over. I want to go
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:32.740]   home. Get out of the park. I would say also. So Mia is a
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.340]   great place. In St. Germain trying to give you some options
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:42.020]   here geographically is a is a great sort of modern modern
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:47.340]   bistro. That's really lovely. And then, oh boy, there's like
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.940]   coffee shops everywhere, like good quality coffee shops, you
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.980]   do need to just if that's something that's important to
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.740]   you, it's something that's important to me, you have to
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.140]   make sure you have the list because if you go into any old
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.740]   corner cafe, you'll probably have a really disgusting cup of
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.180]   coffee.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.700]   Is that list on your guide or where?
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.700]   No, it's a separate guide I am currently working on. But a lot
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.940]   of it is also on my my Instagram page, for example. And in my
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.460]   first book, there's a whole chapter on quality quality
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.020]   coffee and the difference between cafe culture and coffee
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.900]   culture. So if you want to sort of get the the foundation for
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.220]   why it's historically been bad, that gives you a nice primer.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.540]   But yeah, I think the market the market is a really great place
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.500]   because also it'll give you lots of options. That's that's the
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.660]   covered market. And then there are the pop up markets that are
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.540]   several times a week in different neighborhoods.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.380]   Definitely look, look into that. I mean, you can even Google open
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.700]   air food markets in Paris. And you know, it's a great place to
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.500]   go get a bunch of ingredients and cheeses and go to a park and
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.140]   have a picnic.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:53.340]   Love that. Any What about people that are looking for some baked
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:57.020]   goods? Any suggestions? Or a couple bakeries?
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:00.300]   I cannot I literally am physically incapable of giving
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:04.020]   just a couple like it's just tremendous. I mean, if there's
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.220]   one that I can recommend that is has several locations that might
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.580]   be easy for people. Pierre HermÃ© is the is the you know, the
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.740]   star, he's been called the Picasso of pastry. And so
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:20.820]   obviously, he has like, multiple locations. And and his stuff is
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:25.340]   his stuff is incredible. But you know, I would also say, you
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.900]   know, some of the neighborhood bakeries are really where the
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.020]   the huge talent is these days. And one of my favorites is
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:36.820]   utopi. I mean, we say utopi, but it's spelled like utopia. But
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.820]   with an E at the end,
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:43.340]   is it near open door or opened? No, there's an open comp. I
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:43.740]   can't remember.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.340]   Overcome. Yes, over. Yes, yes. That's exactly in your word.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.860]   Yes, we tried to go there. It was like the line was
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:52.180]   ridiculous. Yeah, the line. I mean, that'll tell you something
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.980]   if you go on a Sunday morning, forget it, you're going to be
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.260]   waiting in a line. But the the pastries are excellent. I would
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.820]   say mamish is another one. They have a location in the 10th and
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.700]   one in the ninth. I want this small and it's really, really
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.340]   excellent. And then for the rest, I mean, you just got to
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.740]   connect with me and you know, get my list.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:15.340]   Yeah, definitely connect with Lindsay, getting around subway,
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.500]   I found easy, there's there's no real need to do anything else.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.980]   I don't think we ever took a taxi or an Uber or anything at
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:27.220]   all. We took the train from the airport. Any other things people
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.020]   should think about when it comes to transportation?
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:34.620]   Um, be mindful of the e scooters, they will be phased
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.660]   out. However, at the end of August, because the city voted
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:43.180]   to get rid of them. They were a bit of a problem. Just like the
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.700]   lack of enforcement of rules is a problem. But anyway, that's
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.740]   that's for another conversation. So yeah, I would say you just
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.580]   while they're still sort of operating, you need to be
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.780]   mindful when you're walking around because they zip and come
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.020]   out of nowhere. But you really can either walk everywhere or
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.060]   take the metro. And, you know, if you're if you're someone,
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.460]   rarely do I encounter people who are like, I love the bus, I'm
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.820]   going to try to figure out the bus, the bus is like not very
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.860]   efficient, only because they're, there's a lot of construction in
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.620]   the city. And so even though they have their own lane,
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.420]   they're often delayed. And they don't, they don't run as
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.300]   frequently as the metro. So you're going to spend a lot more
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:24.100]   time waiting around. But walk, metro, and if you're really
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.660]   courageous, you can take one of the, you know, the bikes, the
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.660]   city bike share program or the like Uber jump things. They're
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.420]   sort of all over the place. But there's really very little need
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   to take a cab unless you're like stumbling home drunk after a
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.980]   great meal. But even then the metro is probably still
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.740]   operating.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.100]   We didn't talk actually about about drinking and nightlife.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:52.580]   What's the the vibe like for bars, you know, that kind of
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.380]   stuff after dinner?
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.460]   I mean, cocktails are still very much a fixture of the of the of
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.100]   the dining and nightlife landscape. I would say wine bars
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:08.180]   also are sort of treated almost as, as destinations like
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.660]   cocktail bars. And so especially if you're into certain types of
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.700]   wine, like natural wine or organic wine, there's like, you
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.020]   know, a slew of those kinds of bars. And even hotel bars, I
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.820]   mean, they they definitely are still the more expensive type of
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.780]   experience. But there are some that are still very iconic,
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.460]   whether it's, you know, the Hemingway bar at the Ritz, or
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.300]   the Ambassador in the the Creon Hotel at Place de la Concorde. I
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.180]   mean, these are places that are just so sumptuous in terms of
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.140]   their interiors that like, if you really want that vibe, and
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.060]   you don't mind spending maybe 25 euros on a cocktail, like go
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.260]   there. Otherwise, there's really no need to spend a whole lot of
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.420]   money. And also, if you're into beer, there are some craft beer
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.740]   bars, too. So you sort of we have we have all of the things.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.820]   You can stay out late, but not too late, because the city
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.380]   basically all these all these places close, I think around one
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:12:59.860]   o'clock.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:03.100]   And and you know, you mentioned the footing, but where would you
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   find a good cocktail bar? Like, where would you go to find that?
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.420]   Is it just I mean, Google Maps ratings, I find have become more
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.500]   and more reliable. But is that is that a source or what would
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.340]   Google ratings, but actually the footing also lists cocktail
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.260]   bars. So you've got both restaurants and cocktails. And
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.460]   then there's some specialists. There's Forrest Collins, who has
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:28.540]   a website and blog. I think her her nickname is 52 martinis. But
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:33.220]   her her her podcast is has a different name. But essentially,
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.420]   if you if you Google 52, martinis and Paris cocktails,
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.300]   you'll sort of get her expert list. And she sort of made that
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:44.980]   her, her niche here. But but for a more general view, the footing
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.900]   has a great list.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.980]   One thing that I've done in Paris and all of France is you
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.540]   can also get a bottle of wine, get some cheese gets a bit like
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.220]   just sit in a park. So maybe talk about how to craft what
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.340]   would you do to craft just like a nice one of those experiences
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.940]   that maybe doesn't need a restaurant.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.500]   That's a that's a great, a great option that honestly, I do on
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.980]   the regular, especially as we're getting into these. As you and I
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.060]   were talking about when we first jumped on on the chat, it was,
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.900]   you know, I was I was commenting on how it is, you know, set
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.700]   almost 730 here and it's still bright and light and in the
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.460]   heart of summer, you can go to the Canal Saint Martin or by the
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.660]   river and you know, you'll have light until well after 10pm. So
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.660]   that makes it perfect for a picnic. But I would say, avoid
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.060]   the like student thing, which is going to like the supermarket
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:39.300]   and buying a supermarket bottle of wine, like go to go to a wine
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:44.180]   cellar or wine shop, make it a special thing. Figure out what
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.900]   region or what, you know, what kind of wine you want to drink
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:52.940]   red, white, orange, sparkling, whatever. Figure out the region
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:57.860]   and then maybe ask the the the wine expert what they recommend
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.980]   pairing with it, what kinds of cheeses then go to the
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.140]   cheesemonger. I mean, so yeah, you can't do this too late at
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:06.020]   night, because obviously the shops close. But if you plan for
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.980]   it, you can really get some, you know, tremendous products and
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.500]   then sit outside and then see other people, mostly locals
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.380]   doing the same thing.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:17.620]   Love that it actually reminded me I had a good friend who gave
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.020]   me a couple recommendations from his recent trip. He said on the
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:25.780]   cheese side, from Audrey Lauren Dubois is like, oh, yeah, the
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.860]   place to a couple other random ones. He suggested were the
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.860]   Paris Philharmonic or Philharmonic. He had to go out.
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.340]   Yeah, to go out. These are all all a bit across the board. But
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.940]   I was like, it just made me think to look it up. And the
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.940]   other is there's a street artist named invader, which has these
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:46.460]   great space invader. Yeah. And there's a cool app called flash
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.900]   invaders, where you can kind of collect all of them all over
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.100]   there all over France, like 1000s and 1000s over 1000 of
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.260]   these kind of space invader piece of art just in Paris. And
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.940]   he said, you know, not only was it fun for him, but it was super
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.020]   fun for his kids to have a thing to like, go around Paris and
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.500]   collect and earn some points. And it kind of made the
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.140]   experience of wandering around the city, which might often make
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:14.100]   children kind of bored, it got them very excited. And so those
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.220]   were his three tips.
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:18.500]   It keeps them very engaged, but also the adults because I have
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:24.100]   my husband does flash, does the app and plays the game. And, and
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.340]   I have several friends that do this. And then those with kids
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.140]   definitely do it with their kids. And so it's sort of like
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.540]   fun for everyone. And the incentive is just to like gain a
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.700]   lot of points and then beat each other, or just be ranked higher
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.540]   than one another. But you know, what's interesting about it is
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:42.060]   in places like Versailles, or Fontainebleau, which have royal
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:48.100]   heritage, the mosaic tiles in the invaders themselves, or the,
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.260]   you know, whatever they're called, are very clever. I mean,
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.380]   they're related to the place in many in many instances,
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.940]   especially in like smaller towns. So you'll have like, I
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:03.220]   think there's one of Napoleon somewhere. And so so it does
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:06.100]   create also sort of like semi educational, but also it's fun.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.300]   Yeah, no, that's one thing where I was like, I really missed out
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.900]   on that on my trip. He had one more recommendation, which is
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.900]   kind of in line with what you just mentioned with Versailles,
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.260]   which is, we talked about the broader regions of France, we
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.740]   talked about Paris, if someone's in Paris, and they're looking to
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:23.300]   go somewhere, but not too far. Are there some kind of day
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.860]   trips, or maybe overnight trips that you'd say someone should
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.380]   tack on? And maybe that's how we'll leave people today?
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.420]   Yeah, I mean, Versailles is definitely the common one, but
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.700]   it's very overwhelming. And depending on when you go, it
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.340]   might be literally like everyone and their mother and their
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.580]   grandmother is there. And it can feel I know, it feels very dense
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.500]   and overwhelming. But Fontainebleau is the other one
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.580]   that I would recommend because you get the chateau, you get the
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:53.300]   connection to, you know, it used to be the hunting lodge. I mean,
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:56.740]   lodge is a is a small word for what what it actually is, which
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:59.980]   is like essentially a palace, but it's where the kings would
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.660]   all go to when they were hunting and sort of a getaway. And it's
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.100]   attached to this really lovely city, a town called Fontainebleau
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.460]   and you can have a meal, you can spend the night, you can go to
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.140]   the go to see the chateau. And then if you're an outdoorsy
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.060]   person, you can go to the forest, which is attached, like,
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.820]   you know, within walking distance or a quick a quick
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.180]   ride, which so it's called the Fontainebleau forest, and it is
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.460]   an internationally renowned destination for bouldering. So
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.100]   like I said, my husband's a boulder and rock climber. This
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.740]   has been ever since I've known him the place he goes almost
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.900]   every weekend, but you you come across people who just want to
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:42.220]   hike. You can go walk around and pick a spot and then picnic. It
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:45.900]   really is a wonderful outdoor place. So I would say for a day
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.740]   trip or an overnight, think about Fontainebleau.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:52.900]   Awesome. The other one, my friend suggested was Puy de Fou.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.780]   For wine.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.740]   Well, no, he said it was kind of like a
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.380]   Oh, the amusement park.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.300]   There's this amusement park that he enjoyed as a as an adult and
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.900]   thought was super interesting. Children enjoyed and was like,
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.700]   this was the highlight. This was for him. It was the day trip
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.500]   highlight of the entire trip. And that's so interesting. It's
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.420]   thought it was the most amazing thing they've ever done. And
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.500]   he's like, and I loved it, too. I don't know if you've been
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.220]   there. Well, no, I don't have any first day.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.860]   And I also don't have kids. So like my that I it's not like my
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:26.260]   first instinct to go to a place like that. But that's very good
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.540]   to know. And I would say that's a much better idea than going to
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:32.220]   Disney, which is like very underwhelming when you've when
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:37.020]   or if you've experienced Disney in the US. So skip Disney.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.860]   Yeah, but Puy de Fou, I'm like, I've looked at the website and
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.340]   there's like people jumping in fire. And he described it as
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:47.500]   like, a mix of a show and a carnival and a renaissance
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:52.260]   fair. Yeah, with excellent food, which just kind of goes back to
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.900]   France is not going to have their own French amusement park
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.420]   with bad food. And he I don't know, he just had wonderful
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.220]   things to say about it. So Ethan, thank you. Thank you for
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:05.460]   that tip and others. And that and then last thing, as people
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:09.620]   are getting around. We said Metro in Paris, is it train? Is
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.540]   it flights? How do you think about just kind of we, if people
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.620]   go back to the beginning of this and think, I'm going to add one
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:18.300]   or two regions, I'm going to do a day trip to Fontainebleau. Is
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.460]   it all train? Or how do you think people should think
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.940]   logistically about getting around?
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.900]   I think that if you're gonna if you're gonna go somewhere and
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.980]   then be trying to see a lot of things in another region, you
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   can get there by train. Most likely, I mean, they're, to be
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.380]   honest, you could do everything by train, it just might take you
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:42.820]   a while. So places that are not on the high speed rail line, you
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.660]   can still access by train. But so imagine, let's say you're
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.180]   going to spend a whole week in Normandy, for example, I would
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.500]   say you could get there by train, but then you want to be
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.740]   able to pick up a car. And so that might not make a lot of
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:59.300]   sense, given where maybe rental car rental spots are. So you
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.340]   know, from a place like Paris, you could rent a car and drive
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.740]   to Normandy or drive to some of these places if you plan on
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:08.100]   trying to discover a lot of things. The Loire Valley is a
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.140]   place where you could actually do a like a bike trip, and
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:14.500]   discover the region entirely by bike because they have something
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.060]   like I don't know if it's like 800 miles of bike paths in this
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.540]   in the entire region. So it's sort of set up for that kind of
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:26.060]   experience. And if you're going in to Provence, and you're not
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.900]   going to be staying in cities, and you're going to be going
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.580]   into villages and trying to drive around and see as much as
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.700]   you can see, you will need a car. But there, I'd say you
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:37.860]   could take a train from Paris, and then rent a car when you get
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.460]   down there near the train stations like Avignon, for
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:44.500]   example, or Aix-en-Provence or Marseille, and you can rent a
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.780]   car and then go from there. The places where people tend to fly
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.820]   simply because it, you know, it can be faster or more direct is
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:58.700]   to like to Nice, to Biarritz and the western the southwestern
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.740]   coast. But there are very few places. You know, if you're, if
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.860]   you're not in any rush, and you like a long train ride, use the
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:07.580]   train system.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.140]   This has been so awesome. You know, so I feel like we didn't
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:15.020]   even come close to tapping all of your knowledge. But you share
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.700]   a lot on social, you have a digital restaurant guide, we're
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.260]   going to link to it in the show notes. You've even written
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.060]   books, if you want to listen, you know, so there's a lot of
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:27.180]   stuff you've done, but where can people find all of it? And can
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.460]   they reach out and ask questions?
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.380]   Absolutely. So I think the easiest is probably just to find
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.380]   me on at Lindsey Tramuta calm, because then you can find my
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.900]   socials, you can find, you know, my newsletter, sign up, you can
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.340]   find my podcast, sign up, you can do it, find all the things
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.980]   you can find me from there. And I'd be I'd be happy to chat.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.460]   Any parting advice for someone thinking about a trip to France
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.180]   before we before we sign off?
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.900]   The only thing I would say is do a little bit of research, don't
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.500]   just come and be like, I'm going to wing everything, because I
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.060]   think that's where people get disappointed, especially when it
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:01.020]   comes with food, do a little bit of planning, and then leave the
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:05.300]   rest up to sort of, you know, whatever, whatever you feel like
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:09.220]   doing, whatever the mood into, you know, leads you to choose,
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.380]   but there is a minimum amount of planning that's really necessary
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.180]   to ensure you'll have the experience you deserve to have.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:18.460]   I look forward to doing that planning for the next trip. Thank
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.940]   you so much for being here. Thanks, Chris. I really enjoyed
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.440]   it.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.860]   A bientot!
