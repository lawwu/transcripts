[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the ninth verse of that chapter
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   which we read together at the beginning, namely the sixth chapter of the epistle of Paul to the Galatians.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   The ninth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   "And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Now those who attend here regularly Sunday mornings will understand at once why it is that we propose to consider together this morning that particular verse.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We've been spending many Sunday mornings together, indeed since the second Sunday morning of this present year,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   in considering what we have described as spiritual depression, namely that condition which afflicts so many of God's people,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   alas, to which we are all subject and from which undoubtedly we have all at some time or another suffered.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   A condition in which we are depressed, truly Christian, definitely spiritual, but depressed Christians,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and at times even meriting the term miserable Christians.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And we are considering this for the good reason that not only is it something which is terribly and tragically wrong in and of itself,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   but still more important at a time like this, with the world as it is, in all its godlessness and chaos and trouble,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   there is nothing which is more tragic than the fact that God's own people should be failing to stand out
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   as great signposts indicating the true way of life and of living to the masses of the people.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So that from every standpoint this is a condition which we must examine in order that we may discover the causes of it
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and apply the appropriate remedy which is provided for us somewhere or another in the pages of the scriptures.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Now we've been looking at these various causes. The Bible is full of this kind of thing.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's a book that has been written in order that God's people may be helped in this world.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That's why it is written. And that is especially true of all these New Testament epistles.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   They were all written because of some situation that had arisen.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   The way to view them is not to think of a man who was primarily a literary man sitting in a study and writing a great treatise.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Not at all. This apostle Paul was an evangelist, a man who travelled about and a teacher.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And he generally writes his letters because of some trouble somewhere.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And in order to help people to understand the cause of their trouble and the way, I say, to overcome it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so they deal with all these possible causes.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We can be quite certain of this, that there is no cause of spiritual depression today but that it's dealt with in the scriptures.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   The rules and the laws of the spiritual life are always the same. They never vary.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The appearances differ. The particular guise in which the difficulty may appear before us may change.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But the thing itself is constant and it never varies because the cause of it all, the devil, never varies.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Very well, then. Here I say this morning we come to yet another cause of this condition of spiritual depression.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And at once it reminds us of something that we've had occasion to underline several times before, namely the terrible subtlety of our adversary.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Now the last two Sunday mornings we've been looking together at the way in which the devil tempts men,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   tempts Christian people to go off the rails and makes them miserable by suggesting false teachings to them.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's a very clever way of putting certain things in the center which shouldn't be there,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   or giving us some new kind of religion which is a mixture of various religions,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   the Colossian heresy that we were considering together last Sunday morning.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But now this morning you see we're in quite a different climate altogether.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   At this point he's not concerned so much about the danger of going astray after some heresy, some error,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   taking up some calques and believing that that is the true faith. That's not what he's concerned about at all.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's in a way something that is even more subtle than that,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   because there is ostensibly and on the surface nothing wrong at all apparently.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But you see what happens here is that people just become weary and tired while still on the rails, still going in the right direction.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Here is the case of those not who deviate and go off in this direction or that direction or even turn back.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   No, they're going on the right road and they're facing in the right way, but it's the way they're doing it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   They're shuffling along with their heads and their hands drooping.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They are, as it were, moving along, and yet the whole spectacle, the picture they present,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   is in and of itself the very antithesis of what the Christian is meant to be in this life and in this world.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Now, perhaps the best way of looking at this tendency on our part to weariness is to look at it, first of all, in general.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   This is what we may call the danger of the middle period.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   The danger of the middle period. It's something which is true, not only in the Christian life as such, in the spiritual life,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   it's true of the whole of life.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   This problem of middle life, if you like, middle age, the middle period,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   it's something which is evident on all hands.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's something that we all have to face sooner or later, just as we grow older from year to year.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   There is great attention being paid to young people today,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   and there is a considerable amount of attention being paid to old people.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   But I am perfectly convinced, and I say this on the basis of my experience with others and of my reading,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   that the most difficult period of all is the middle period,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   because it has certain factors which enter in, which make it peculiarly difficult.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   There are certain compensations in youth, and there are compensations in old age,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   which seem to be almost entirely lacking in this middle period.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So I say it's something that we all tend to encounter just as we get older.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   A certain resilience, a certain vigor, a certain buoyancy in a physical sense tends to go,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   and one is aware of a slowing and a slackening of one's power and of one's pace.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I needn't develop it. It's something with which we are familiar in theory,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   if not in actual experience and practice.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's exactly the same also, is it not, in connection oftentimes with a man's work or profession.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And that is what constitutes a problem to so many such people.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It means, you see, that you've got beyond that stage of developing and building up,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and you've arrived at a certain level.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And you seem incapable of advancing beyond that, as I've just been saying,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   for certain physical reasons, perhaps alone, and there you are on this level.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   You're no longer climbing. You've arrived somewhere.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And the difficulty is to keep going at that level,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   lacking the stimulus that took you to the level.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's often happened with the men in business.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It is sometimes much more difficult to maintain a business than it is to build it up.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Everything seems to be with you, in a sense, as you're building up.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's when you've arrived at that point you lose a certain stimulus,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and you find it extremely difficult to hold it and to keep going.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Well, I say that I could illustrate this almost endlessly,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   taking it purely from the natural life and from our experience
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   in work and in profession and in various other things.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I think as you read the biographies of men,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   even the most successful men that the world has ever known,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   in any branch or in any department,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   they will all, in a sense, testify together in saying
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   that that was, of all periods in their life, the most difficult of all.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   But now this is also true of the religious life and of the spiritual life.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's the stage which follows the initial experience,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   that initial experience in which everything was new and everything was surprising
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and everything was wonderful and everything was thrilling,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   the stage in which one was constantly making new discoveries.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And these discoveries never seem to come to an end,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   but suddenly one is conscious of the fact that they do seem to have come to an end.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And one becomes accustomed to the Christian life,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and one is no longer surprised by things as one was at the beginning
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   because one is simply familiar with them, one knows about them.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   So that all that element which kept us going, as it were, so much in the early stages,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   suddenly seems to have gone.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Nothing seems to be happening.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   There doesn't seem to be any change, there doesn't seem to be any advance,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   there doesn't seem to be any development.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Now this may be true of us individually, it may be true of our work,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   it may be true of a church, it may be true of a whole collection of people,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   it may be true of a missionary society, and so on.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I'm given to understand, and I know it is the truth,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   that this particular question to which I'm adverting
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   does happen to be one of the major problems in connection with the foreign mission work.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And missionaries who spent their time abroad will all know exactly what I mean
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   by the things I'm saying at this present time.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It is just that point when you've got all of the newness and the surprise of the new country,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   the new climate, the new language, the thrill and the excitement of doing something you've never done before,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   and you just settle down into your routine, into your regular daily work of doing the same thing day after day,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   then this trial arises.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And you no longer are carried over it by that initial momentum
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   which seemed to take you through it all in the early stages and at the beginning.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Now that, I say, is the condition with which the apostle is dealing here.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And perhaps to make it all worse and to aggravate it, there may be troubles, difficulties pressing upon you.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Other people may add to your troubles.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   They may do things they shouldn't do or not do what they should do.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   There may be trials and difficulties and troubles all around you.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   On top of this, you yourself are entering this middle period,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and then these things happen to you in addition.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   The result is that one becomes wary in well-doing.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Now, I mustn't take any more time in describing the condition,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and yet it is so important that we should understand exactly what it is.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   There it is, I say, the point at which the stage of development and of advance seems to have come to an end.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And you're in some kind of doldrums when it's difficult to tell whether the ship is moving at all,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   either backwards or forwards.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It just seems to be set and fixed, and nothing at all seems to be taking place.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Now, there's no doubt at all that these Galatian Christians had at any rate some of them arrived at that particular point.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   There's no doubt at all that their particular heresy, which we looked at a fortnight ago, had something to do with this.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It always has a depressing effect.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   That's why we must be always careful about heresies and errors.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Ultimately, they will lead to this depression, and then we become depressed in the work.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Very well, then. Now, let's define it like this, perhaps.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   We are considering people who are not so much tired of the work as tired in it.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Be not wary in well-doing.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Very well, that's the condition. What do we say about it, and what do we do about it?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Well, there is no aspect of this great problem in which the negative is more important than it is on this particular occasion.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Whenever we find in this position of wariness, spiritually, before we begin to do anything positive,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   there are certain negatives, I say, that are absolutely all-important.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The first of them is this.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Whatever you may feel like, don't listen to the suggestions that come to you from all directions.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I don't mean so much from people as from within yourself, from voices that seem to be speaking round and about you.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Don't listen to them when they tell you to give up or to give way or to give in.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That is the temptation that comes at that point always. You say, "I just can't go on.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   I'm too weary, I'm too tired, I can't possibly. The thing's too much for me."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And there's nothing to say at that point, I say, but this direct negative.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You've always got to start with these conditions on the very lowest level, and that is the lowest level.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You say to yourself, "Whatever else happens, I'm going on." You don't give up, you don't give way.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   But that perhaps isn't the greatest danger.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The greatest danger is the one which I'm going to put in the form of my second negative injunction.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Don't resign yourself to it. That's the real danger.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   There is the danger, of course, of giving up and turning back and going out. There are people who have done that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   That's backsliding. There are the people who hand in the resignations and say, "I'm quitting, I'm finished with it."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But that isn't the case with the majority.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The danger with the majority at this point is just to resign themselves to it and to lose heart and to lose hope.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Yes, they will go on, but they'll go on in this weary, helpless, dragging condition.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   To put it more spiritually, let me put it like this.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   The danger at this point is to say something like this to yourself, "Well, I've lost that something which I had,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   and obviously I'll never have that back again, so I'll just go on. I'll go on formally.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I'll go on out of habit, I'll go on out of custom. I'll go on as a sheer matter of duty.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I've lost the thrill, I've lost the enjoyment, I've lost the abandon.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   That's gone, and it's undoubtedly gone forever. Well, what do I do?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Well, I've just got to put up with it. I'll resign myself to my fate, I'll stick it, I won't be a quitter,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I won't turn my back, I won't resign, I won't go out.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But I'll go on, I will go on, but I'll go on, well, feeling rather hopeless about it all.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Just the spirit of resignation, stoicism if you like, putting up with it.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yes, I'm going down the road, I'm just shuffling down the road, I'm not walking with head erect as I once was,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I'll just go on in that way.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Now, I think that that is the greatest danger of all.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And again, I suggest to you that it is something that is a danger not only at the spiritual level,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   which we are most concerned about here, it's a danger at every single level in life.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   You can run your business like that, you can work like that in your profession.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   You can live like that in any sense you like.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   You've really said to yourself, the golden hours have gone, the great days belong to the past.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I'll never know that again, but I'll just keep on keeping on, I'll just go on.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   There's something, of course, at first that seems very wonderful about it.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   There's something that seems almost heroic about it, but you notice I'm putting it as a negative.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I suggest it's the very temptation of the devil.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   If he can get us just to go on as formal Christians who've lost their hope,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and lost their joy, and lost their vigor, he'll be very well content indeed.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And as I see things today, this is perhaps the greatest danger of all confronting the Christian Church.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   The danger of continuing in a formal spirit as a matter of duty.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Yes, going on, but warily trudging along instead of walking as we ought to walk.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And then that brings me to my third and my last negative,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   which I think you will recognize again is a very dangerous one.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   The third thing against which we warn ourselves is that when we thus feel weary and tired,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   if there is one thing above everything else we mustn't do, it is this, never resort to artificial stimulants.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   You know the temptation, don't you?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   It's been the ruination of many a man,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   who, as I say, has built up a profession or a business or something like that.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Then he gets into this stage I'm describing,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   and he is conscious that he hasn't the vigor and the whim that he had.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   He doesn't feel, as the phrase has it, that he's on top of his job.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And he doesn't know what to do because he's not neglecting anything as far as he can tell.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And somebody comes along and suggests to him,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   "Look here, what you need is some sort of a tonic, some kind of a fillip."
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   The whole danger of drink and of alcohol comes in at that very point.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Many a man has ended in a drunkard's grave who started like that.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   He didn't take drink for the sake of drink, not because he liked it, not because he wanted it,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   not even to be convivial.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   He just did it because he felt, "It's the only way I can carry on.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   If I don't have a stimulus, I'm done for. I can't continue."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It was suggested to him, it may have come into his mind, and he did it.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   He resorted to an artificial stimulant.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And of course it seems so plausible.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You feel to yourself, "If only I could get something just to lift me a little,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   then all would be well with me."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But people take to drugs, they take to drink and various other things in precisely that way.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   But my friends, this has a very important and a very vital spiritual application.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I have seen many people in the church dealing with this condition of spiritual weariness in that very way.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   They work up an excitement.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   They'll adopt a new method.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   They say, "Now we must rouse ourselves out of this, so we'll put on something."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   They put on a new program, something additional.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Haven't you seen it sometimes on the very advertisements outside certain church buildings?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Can't you think of certain churches?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   You always find some fresh announcement outside, some new attraction,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   the visit of this or that, or something marvelous, come and see it, and so on.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   A church which is obviously living on artificial stimulants.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And it's all being done with this idea in mind.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   The pastor or somebody else responsible has said to himself,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   "Well now, we're just not moving. We're becoming rather dead, and things are becoming formal.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Now what can we do about this?"
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Well, he says, "Look here, let's get this in. It'll cause a stir.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It'll be a new interest. It'll provide an excitement."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I think there's been a great deal of this.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And my whole suggestion this morning is that that kind of thing in the spiritual life
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and in the life of the church is comparable to one thing only on the natural level,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and that is to the man who takes the drink, or to drugs, or to some excitement.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Something to work himself up.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Now obviously that again is an extremely subtle temptation and a very subtle danger.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   It seems to be so plausible. It seems just the thing we need.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And yet of course the terrible fallacy behind all this is simply in a scientific sense
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   that what you're really doing is to exhaust yourself still more.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   The more the man relies upon the drink or the drug or whatever it is,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   the more rarely he's draining away his own vital energy.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And ultimately he'll be more exhausted, so he must have more drink and more stimulus and more drug.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And it's exactly the same at the spiritual level.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I've seen many a church which having started along this particular course
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   simply finds that it has to go on doing it. The people will ask for more.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   If once you resort to the artificial, more and more will be required and desired,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   and you'll have to have more and more.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And your life is kept going by this kind of thing.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Well now there are the three negatives which are of supreme importance.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Let's turn to the positive.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Avoiding those three dangers and pitfalls, what do we do?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Here we are, we are weary in well-doing. What do we do about it?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Well I say the first thing is self-examination.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Start by examining yourself.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Don't walk out, I say. Don't just say, "Well it can't be helped,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I'll have to carry on the rest of my life like this."
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Or don't take your stimulus. Stop for a moment, sit down,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   and say to yourself, "Well now then, why am I weary?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   What's the cause of my weariness?"
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's surely the obvious question.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   You see, you don't treat a thing before you've diagnosed it.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   You don't apply a remedy until you know exactly what the cause is.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It is the most fatal thing to do, medically speaking,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   to rush to treatments before you'll know exactly the condition with which you're dealing.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   So you must examine, you must diagnose, you must inquire.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And you say, "Well why am I weary? What's the matter with me?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Why have I got into this condition?"
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Well now, there may be endless answers at this point.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   I can't hope to give you them all, but here's one of them.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   You may be in that condition simply because you're working too hard.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Physical, purely physical.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   You can, I say, be tired in the work and not tired of the work.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   It is possible that a man has been working, I don't care what realm,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   whether the natural or the spiritual, he's been so over draining and over taxing
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   his energy and his resources that he's just down physically.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   If you work too hard or under a strain, you're bound to suffer.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And of course, if that is the cause of your trouble, the remedy is obvious.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You need a rest. You need physical attention. You need medical treatment.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Now my friends, that is sometimes the case.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   There's a great and notable example of it in the Old Testament, the case of Elijah.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You remember when he had this kind of attack. He sits under his juniper tree.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But the real thing that he needed at that time, you remember, was sleep and food,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and God gave him both.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   He gave him the food and the rest before he gave him the spiritual treatment.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   It's a recognized principle in the Scriptures, and it's obvious when you come to think of life.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   But wait a minute, leaving that out, let's assume that it isn't that.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   What else may be the cause of this trouble?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Well, another very frequent cause is this.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   We may have been living our Christian life or doing our Christian work by means of carnal energy.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   We may have been doing it all.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Instead of working in the power of the Spirit,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   we may have been working with a mere carnal, human, and perhaps even physical energy.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   We may have been trying to do God's work ourselves.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And, of course, if we try to do that, there can be only one result.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It will eventually crush us.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It's such exalted and such high work.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So we must stop and examine ourselves.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Is there something wrong about the way in which I'm doing that work?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Let every man examine himself.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I examine myself in this pulpit as I speak.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   It is possible for a man to preach with a carnal energy.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And if he does, he will sooner or later be suffering from this spiritual exhaustion,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   this spiritual depression.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But then a still more important and a much more spiritual question again is this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I must ask myself, "Why have I been doing the work?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   What has really been my motive?"
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Here I am. I've been very active and I've been very busy.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   At first it was so remarkable, it was so enjoyable.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It was all such a great thrill to me.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Now I find it's become a burden and I'm tired and I'm weary.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Now then ask this question.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Why really have you been doing it the whole time?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Oh, it's a terrible question that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Because you know it may be the first time you've ever asked it.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   You've taken it for granted that your motive was a good one and a pure one,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   but you sometimes will find that it wasn't.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   You know there are some people who work simply for the sake of the thrill and the excitement.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   There's no question about it at all.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I have seen people working very actively in Christian work.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I have had no doubt myself and subsequent experience of them has taught me that I was right,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   that what they were really concerned about was the thrill and the excitement.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   There are some people who are never happy unless they're doing something.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   They'll rush from one activity to the other.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   They don't always realize it, but what they're really out for is the thrill and the excitement.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And certainly as we live on that sort of thing, we'll get exhausted.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   We will become weary. We will become tired.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Our greatest enemy may have come in and that is self.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Perhaps really we've been doing all we've been doing simply to satisfy self.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   In order to please ourselves, in order to be able to say to ourselves how wonderful we are
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   and how much we are doing.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   But it is the subtle, foul, terrible enemy self that follows us everywhere.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   We like to say it's for the glory of God. It's often for my own glory.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Self.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   So that we are busy, that we are important.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   We say we don't want the praise, of course, to God be the glory.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And we say we're only giving the results, not that people may look at us, but that God may have the glory.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And yet we are giving the results, you see.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And it appears in the papers and so on.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Self has come in.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And self is a terrible master.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   If we're working to satisfy and to please self in any shape or form,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   the end is always going to be weariness and tiredness.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Self is a poor master to work for.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   So we've got to ask ourselves the question about the motive.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Why have I been doing it all?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And then lastly, a very important question in self-examination, I think, is this.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Has this work, I wonder, kept me going?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Instead of being my work, has it been the sort of main spring of my life?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I'm sure there are many present who know exactly what I mean by that.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   One of the greatest dangers in the spiritual life is to live on your own activities.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   In other words, the activity isn't in the right place as something which you do.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   No, it's something that keeps you going.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I've seen some of the greatest tragedies I've seen in this very connection in such men.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Men who didn't realize it, but they'd been going for years,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   simply in the force and the momentum of their own activities.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Their own activities had kept them going.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And then when perhaps they were taken ill or something like that happened,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   or they were taken, they became old men and they could no longer do what they used to do.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   They became depressed.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   They didn't know what to do with themselves when they had to sit in a corner.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Why? Well, they'd been living on their own activities.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   They'd been kept going by the momentum.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I suppose it is the disease of civilization.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I suppose this is the greatest cause of neurasthenia, the neuroses, and the psychoses at the present time.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   That unfortunately the world has become so mad that we're all being kept going by this terrific momentum.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Instead of being in control and knowing what we're doing and able to do it properly,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   the thing is controlling us.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And it drives us and it presses us until ultimately it exhausts us.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Well, very well, there are some of the main elements that generate in this vital process of self-examination.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   My dear friends, let me emphasize the principle.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   If in any respect in your life this morning you are wary,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   I beseech you, stop and ask these questions.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Why am I wary?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   How have I been carrying on?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Examine your whole attitude towards your life and the thing in particular that you're doing.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And if you feel it about the whole of the Christian life,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and if you're on the point of saying there's nothing in it, I'm giving up.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Now I say, stop and ask those questions.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Why did you ever come into it? What is it? And so on.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But let me put that positively.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   There are certain great principles according to the teaching of the Apostle here,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   which we must recognize if we are to get rid of this condition.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Here's the first.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   There are phases in the Christian life as in the whole of life.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Phases.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The New Testament talks about our being babes in Christ.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It talks about our growing and developing.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   John writes his epistle to little children and to young men and to old men.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   There it is. It's spiritual.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   The Christian life is not always exactly the same.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   There is a beginning and a continuing, and there is a maturing and there is an ending.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And owing to these phases there are many variations.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Feelings, for instance, are most variable.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You expect most feelings at the beginning and you get most feelings at the beginning.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Now many a person has rarely become weary because certain feelings have gone.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   They don't realize that what has happened is that they have matured.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   But because they are not as they were, they say they are all wrong.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   But as we grow and develop spiritually, these changes must take place.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   There are various phases. Quite apart from what happens to us, God deals with us in phases.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   There is no question at all about this.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   For our own good he sometimes seems to withdraw himself.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   There are times when he definitely chastises us.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   It's the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   All for our good, all for our development.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It's because we are children we are chastised.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   If you are not chastised, says the twelfth of Hebrews, you are not children, you are illegitimate.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You are not real sons.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   So all these things obviously are bound to produce changes.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Let me put it perhaps simply in the form of an illustration.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I happened to see the other day a little child aged about four, I should think,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   going out of her house with her mother and her brother.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And I couldn't help but be attracted by the way the child was doing it.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   She didn't walk out of the house, she jumped out and skipped out.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   She gambled out like a lamb.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I noticed her mother walked out, the mother didn't come out like the child came out.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Well, quite so.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Well, very well, let's be sure that we are not guilty of something like that in our spiritual life.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   You see, the child is there bounding with energy, superfluous energy in a sense,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   has not yet learned how to use it and how to control it.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   The mother of that child had a great deal more energy than the child,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   but if you looked at them superficially, you would think that it was the child that was bounding with energy
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and that the mother had very little energy because she walked out slowly.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   But we know that that isn't so.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   The energy is much greater in the adult, but it appears to be greater in the child.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And because you use this ebullience and this excitement and exuberance and this superfluity,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   so many people think that they've lost something vital and they become weary.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Let's recognize the law of development.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Let's recognize that there are phases.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Let's recognize that there are these stages of development in the Christian life.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And sometimes that and that alone will solve the whole problem.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   But come to a second principle, which is this.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Listen to how Paul puts it.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   "Let us not be weary," he says, "in well-doing."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's well-doing, my friend.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Now that's the thing we've tended to forget, isn't it?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Ah, we say there it is, day after day, the same old thing, or week after week.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And that's our attitude towards it, and because that is the attitude towards it, that is why we become weary.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Paul says, "Wait a minute. Let me remind you that you're in the Christian life
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and that the Christian life is well-doing."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   If you regard your Christian life as a task, you're insulting God.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   What is your Christian life? You see the importance of the questions.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Ah, you say, "There it is again. I must go on living another day.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I mustn't do the things that other people do or are in the same profession or work.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I've got to walk this straight and narrow road. I say no to this and no to that.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I take on these burdens and these duties, and I'm engaged in this, and Sunday comes.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I can't stay in bed. I go to church and all this.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   This awful task, this terrible life in which I find myself."
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   But that's it, isn't it?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And the reply to that is that you're engaged in well-doing.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   My dear friend, if you and I have come to regard any aspect of this Christian life as a task and as a duty
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and that we have to cleanse and set our teeth in order to get through with it,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I say we are insulting God, and we've forgotten the very essence of Christianity.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What do I mean? I mean this.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   This isn't a task.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   The Christian life alone is worthy of the name "life."
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   This alone is righteous and holy and pure and good.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It's the kind of life that the Son of God himself lived.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   It's like God himself in his own holiness.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   That's why I should be doing it.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   I don't just decide to go on somehow. Not at all.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I remind myself that it's a great and it's a good life.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   It's well-doing.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   How have I ever come into this life?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm grumbling and complaining that it's hard and that it's arduous
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and that I'm having a very hard and a difficult time.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Let me ask this question. How did you ever come into this Christian life?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Here you are on this narrow way about which you are grumbling so much.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   How did you ever come from that broad way on which you were once walking?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   What's made the difference?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And you ask that question and there's only one answer.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I've come from that to this.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Because the only begotten Son of God left heaven and came down to earth
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   having divested himself of the insignia of his eternal glory
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   and humbled himself and was born as a babe and put in a manger
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and endured the life of this world for 33 years
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   and was spat upon and reviled and had a crown of thorns thrust into his head
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   and was nailed upon a cross and bore the punishment of my sins.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   That's how I've come from that to this.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And if I ever find myself even for a fraction of a second
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   doubting the greatness and the glory and the wonder and the nobility of this walk in which I'm engaged
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   well then I'm spitting upon him.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Out upon the suggestion.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Be not weary in well-doing my friend.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   You've no right to look at yourself like that nor your life like that
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   nor anything you're doing like that.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Do you think of your Christian living in any sense or shape or form?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   With this sense of grudge or of task or of duty or of weariness?
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I say to you go back to the beginning for a moment.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Retrace your steps mentally to the wicked gate through which you passed.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Remember the flow of despond.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Look at the world rotting in evil and in sin.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Look at the hell that's awaiting it.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And then look back and look forward.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And realize that you're set in the most glorious campaign
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   into which a man can ever enter.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And that you're on the noblest road that the world has ever known.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   But let me go on and put it like this.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   The next principle is that this life of ours is but a preparatory one.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Be not weary in well-doing for in due season he shall reap if we faint not.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Oh, come back and look at your life and put it into the context of eternity.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   You're tired, you're weary, you find it's almost too much for you
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and you can't keep going. Stop and say to yourself, "What is this?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   What is this life as a whole? What is it? What's it all mean?"
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Well, it's all nothing but a preparatory school.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   This life is but the antechamber of eternity.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And all we have in this world is but anticipatory of that.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Your greatest joys are but the first fruits and the foretaste
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   of an eternal joy that is coming.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Oh, how important it is to do that.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   You see, the sheer grind of life gets us down.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yes, I've got to get up and do this today.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Men say that in business.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Men may say it in the Christian life.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   A minister may say it.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Another Sunday comes, I've got to prepare two sermons.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   I've got to preach twice.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   What a terrible thing.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   But the sheer grind sometimes almost gets us to that.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And the answer to that, I say, is to look at it all and put it into its great context
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and see that we're but pilgrims going to eternity
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   and this is but the preparatory school.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And what a difference that makes.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Oh, yes, but let me put it still more strongly by putting it like this.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   "Keep on," says Paul, "with your farming."
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Why? Because of the certainty of the harvest that is coming.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   "Be not weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And the moment you realize something about the harvest, you won't faint, my friend.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   The sight of the harvest is what we need.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   The world is too much with us.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   That's our trouble.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   We're too immersed in our problems and complexities.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Look ahead, I say. Anticipate. Look forward.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Have the grand view.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Try to see the eternal glories gleaming afar.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   It's all there.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Every joy in the Christian life is but, I say again,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   a tasting of the first fruits of the great harvest which is to come.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   "My dear friend, I hath not seen, nor I heard,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   neither hath it entered into the heart of men,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Realize the place to which you're going.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   That's the antidote. That's the cure.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The harvest we shall reap.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   It's certain. It's absolute.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Therefore, says Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   "Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Go on with your task, whatever your feelings.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Keep on with your work.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   God will give the increase. He'll send the rain.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   There will be an abundant harvest.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Look forward to the harvest.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   He shall reap.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And on top of it all,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   let us consider the Master for whom we work.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Let us remember how he endured and how patient he was.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Oh, take that mighty argument of the twelfth of Hebrews again.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   "You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   He did.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   He came down and he endured it all, I say.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   And how patient he was.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Oh, how humdrum his life must have seemed to him at times,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   with ordinary petty people misunderstanding him and so on.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   But he went on and he didn't complain.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And how did he do it?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   For the joy that was set before him.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   He endured even the cross, despising the shame.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   That's how he did it.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   He knew the joy that was set before him.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   He knew the crowning that was coming.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   He knew the harvest that he was going to reap.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   And seeing that, he was able not to see these other things
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   and to go through gloriously and triumphantly.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And you and I have the privilege of being like him.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   "If any man will be my disciple," he says,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "let him deny himself, take up his cross."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   That's it.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   "And follow me."
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And he'll give you the honor of even suffering for his name.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Paul says it's the most extraordinary thing to say
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   in writing to the Colossians,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   that he has the privilege of making up in his own body
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   what remains of the sufferings of Christ.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   And what if you weary Christian
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   are having the same privilege without knowing it?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Well, very well, remind yourself of your blessed Master
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and look to him.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And ask him to forgive you for ever having allowed yourself to be weary.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Look at it all again in this way,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and as certainly as you do so,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   you will find that you're filled with a new hope
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   and a new strength and a new power.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You won't need your artificial stimulants or anything else.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   You'll just find that you are again thrilled
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   with the privilege and the joy of it all
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and the love of such a Lord and Savior,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   such a marvelous Master.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   And you'll hate yourself for having grumbled and complained
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and for having shuffled along the road.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And you'll go forward, as you did go forward,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and still more gloriously.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   And on and on you'll go
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   until eventually you'll hear him saying,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   "Well done, thou good and faithful servant.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Enter in to the joy of thy Lord. Amen."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
