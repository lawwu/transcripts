[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.840]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.800]   My guest today is Coleman Ruiz.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   Coleman Ruiz is a former tier one Navy SEAL special operator.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   I think it's fair to assume
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200]   that most of you have never heard of Coleman Ruiz before.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.460]   And in fact, it was part of his former life job description
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.320]   to be largely covert,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.120]   such that only his family and friends
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.080]   really knew what he did for a living.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.660]   He is, however, now living as a civilian.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.420]   And the reason I invited Coleman on this podcast
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.220]   was essentially to tell us his life story,
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.840]   which of course includes his time in the SEAL teams,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.580]   but includes so much more
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.920]   that I'm certain is of value to everyone.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.240]   Today, Coleman shares with you his remarkable journey
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.640]   from childhood through his teenage years
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.880]   into the military,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.320]   and some of the things that happened
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.020]   during his time in the military,
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.860]   which then informed his post-military civilian life,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.120]   and what it is to be a father, a husband,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.980]   and somebody who has experienced tremendous loss
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.700]   at various stages of his life,
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.660]   as well as tremendous triumph.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.300]   Indeed, if ever there was a life
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.020]   that could be framed within the context
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.860]   of the so-called hero's journey,
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.620]   it is the life of Coleman Ruiz.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.620]   Coleman Ruiz's life is one that embodies focus and pursuit,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.580]   family and friends and love,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.060]   all the things that we think of
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.980]   in terms of having a rich life,
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.900]   but also one that includes many unforeseen tragedies,
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.100]   many unforeseen challenges, both internal and external.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.940]   Coleman also shares with a rare
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.060]   and extraordinary degree of vulnerability,
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.980]   the extent to which challenges in life,
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.760]   both external and internal,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.960]   have helped shape him as a human being.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.340]   What follows is a discussion that everyone,
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.660]   male, female, young, or old,
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.500]   and regardless of position in life,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.380]   is sure to derive tremendous benefit from.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.860]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.940]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.860]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.340]   to the general public.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.420]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.300]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.580]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.400]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.500]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860]   I've been doing therapy for over 30 years.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.940]   Initially, I started therapy because, well,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.640]   I was required to in order to stay in school,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940]   but eventually I just decided to keep doing it
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.820]   because I found it to be very beneficial.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.020]   There are essentially three things
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.600]   that great therapy provides.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.060]   First of all, it provides a rapport with somebody
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.940]   that you can trust and talk about all issues with.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.900]   Second of all, they can provide support
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.940]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.460]   And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.980]   that you wouldn't have otherwise had access to.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.180]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.340]   as important as working out one's body in the gym
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.360]   or through cardiovascular exercise.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.740]   And with BetterHelp, scheduling and doing therapy
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.140]   becomes extremely convenient.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.300]   They can match you to a therapist
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.780]   that can provide those three things,
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.020]   excellent rapport, support, and insight,
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.700]   and they can do so on a schedule that matches yours.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.100]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.940]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.820]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.140]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.880]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.780]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.700]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.220]   and with several expert guests on this podcast
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.360]   about the fact that most of us should be seeking
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.100]   to get about one gram of quality protein
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.300]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.980]   Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.580]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.900]   but also for overall metabolism and health.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.660]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.300]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500]   One of the key things, however,
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.720]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.920]   without ingesting excess calories.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.020]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.720]   quality protein per calorie ratio,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.700]   such that getting one gram of protein per pound
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.120]   of body weight is both easy
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.960]   and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.060]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.580]   They have venison steaks, they have ground venison,
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.460]   and they have venison bone broth.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.940]   I personally like all of those.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.340]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.580]   pretty much every day.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.140]   And occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.300]   And if you're really on the go,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.420]   they have Maui Nui Venison jerky,
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.140]   which has 10 grams of protein per stick at just 55 calories.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.980]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.580]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.380]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.220]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.820]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.880]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.980]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.940]   about the critical need to get sleep,
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.780]   both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.600]   When we do that, everything, our mental health,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.820]   our physical health, performance in any sports
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.800]   or school, et cetera, all get better.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.940]   And when we're not sleeping well or enough,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.220]   all those things suffer.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.460]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.480]   is that your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.840]   by about one to three degrees
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.260]   in order to fall and stay deeply asleep.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.980]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.940]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.700]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.540]   One of the best ways to ensure that happens
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.300]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.220]   And with Eight Sleep, it makes it very easy to do that.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.940]   You program in the temperature that you want
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.820]   at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.140]   You can even divide the temperature
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.980]   for two different people,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.860]   if you have two different people sleeping in the bed,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.260]   and it tracks your sleep.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.540]   It tells you how much slow wave sleep
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.460]   and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.660]   It really helps you dial in the correct parameters
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.780]   to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.500]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.100]   for well over three years now,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.900]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.220]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.980]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.140]   and save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.120]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.420]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.700]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.860]   And now for my conversation with Coleman Ruiz.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.540]   Coleman Ruiz, welcome.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.360]   - Thank you.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.820]   Very excited to see you.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.140]   - It's great to have you here.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.780]   I'm guessing most people are probably not familiar
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.660]   with Coleman Ruiz.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.440]   So let's start at the beginning.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.940]   Where were you born?
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.080]   What was the context of your home life?
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.380]   And maybe let's get up to maybe elementary school,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.740]   middle school, and whatever top contour
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.460]   or deep details you want to get into.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.300]   - Yeah.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.460]   - We're all ears.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.940]   - Okay, I'll bring us up to seventh grade,
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.100]   'cause I would say that was probably
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.220]   the first big inflection point in my life.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.260]   I grew up in, I was born in New Orleans
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.420]   in a suburb called New Orleans East, we call it.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.600]   And I have an older sister, two younger brothers.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.740]   My dad was a welder.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.340]   My mom was a dental assistant.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.220]   And we had a couple of boxers and dogs.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.040]   And we had a very modest, very modest upbringing.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.020]   I won't over-dramatize it, but admittedly,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.060]   sometimes we got cheese from the lady across the street
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.980]   who didn't want her welfare cheese.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.260]   And it was one of those.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.420]   You know, I could tell my parents
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.980]   were fighting for every nickel.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.500]   But it was great.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.940]   I mean, my cousin grew up across the street from me.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.720]   He's exactly my age.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   We had that, at least some of my memory, Andrew, of it was,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.820]   it was very pleasant.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.540]   I learned later that you forget a lot of things
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.620]   in your childhood that were unpleasant.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.100]   But my initial memories, when I started thinking
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.060]   about this kind of thing, and, you know,
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.340]   as you and I have discussed, getting professional help,
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.820]   and you start to learn a little bit more
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.180]   about your childhood.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.860]   But I remember it being very pleasant.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.340]   You know, you've told me about your background
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.480]   and skateboarding and stuff.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.100]   You know, we skateboarded the neighborhood.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.180]   BMX was a big thing when we were kids.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.500]   It was very much a rat the streets upbringing.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.000]   There was a park behind the neighborhood.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.700]   We would cut through the fence and go,
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.580]   you know, this kind of thing.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.220]   I played football and baseball,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.580]   and very normal in that regard.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.780]   Went to the neighborhood school.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.220]   And then in sixth grade, I went to what was my high school,
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.660]   but it went fifth through 12th,
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.940]   called Holy Cross High School in the lower ninth ward,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.700]   which that spot is now vacated because the school,
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.340]   I went back after Hurricane Katrina,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.380]   the whole school had to be moved.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.100]   And I went there in seventh grade,
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.020]   and it was a hellacious start.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.380]   I mean, it was detention after detention,
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.420]   you know, fist fight after fist fight,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.780]   and damn near.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.020]   - Were you the instigator of those fights?
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.880]   - Probably some.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.820]   I definitely fell in with the wrong crowd initially
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.940]   in that sixth and seventh grade years.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.060]   And I wouldn't say it was so extreme
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.700]   that like it was complete mayhem,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.380]   but I was definitely on, you know,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.420]   problem, situation, number, whatever,
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.600]   when my parents were called in.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.460]   And it was kind of the last straw type thing.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.820]   And I got cut from baseball.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.940]   My grades were fine.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.540]   I was always a pretty good student.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.460]   It was just teenager shenanigans.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.340]   And then I went out for wrestling.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.980]   - Can I just pause you for a second?
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.300]   So on the violence part,
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   I have a little bit of experience with this,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   but violence can come from trying to protect others,
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.800]   instigating, it can come from the wildness,
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.300]   just trying to, you know,
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.160]   see what it feels like, experimentation,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.460]   and any number of other things,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.880]   all the way to pure sociopathy,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.540]   which we know you are not and weren't.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.940]   Do you recall feeling something inside that inspired this?
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.660]   Was it for attention?
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.820]   Did it feel good afterwards?
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.220]   Can you recall what it was about?
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.780]   - I think it was the wildness thing, Andrew, honestly.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.380]   It wasn't, I mean, I believe,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.500]   I don't have a malicious bone in my body.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.620]   Like, we all have that in us.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.600]   Obviously, my profession later in the military,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.140]   you know, I was able to activate that,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.820]   and I feel like I still can,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.520]   and I was certainly able to in sports,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.060]   which is why that seventh grade year was really pivotal.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.380]   But even now, it's funny,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.620]   it's even funny you ask about the wildness,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.580]   because, let me put it in movie terms.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.780]   Like, one of my favorite movie scenes of all time
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.780]   is in the movie "The Town,"
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.140]   when Ben Affleck walks in the room.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.460]   Jeremy Renner is his partner, essentially,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.540]   and he walks in the room and he says,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.880]   "We're going to hurt somebody.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.940]   "I can't tell you where, and I can't tell you when."
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.500]   And he pauses, and Jeremy Renner
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.860]   takes maybe a three-second pause,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.840]   and he says, "Whose car are we taking?"
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.100]   He doesn't even ask.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.260]   You know, he's just, they're just wild
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.820]   and excited about doing something wild.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.540]   I don't promote, like, going to hurt somebody, of course.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.900]   - Sure, were you the Affleck or the Renner?
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.820]   Affleck, excuse me, or Renner in that?
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   - I was, I feel like I was mostly the Renner.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.620]   Put it this way, if you have some good idea this afternoon,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.020]   like, let's go fucking try this, I'm good, I'm ready.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.580]   And I think it's just exciting.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.220]   You know, I hate rules, I hate being told what to do.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.260]   It's one of the things that was so frustrating
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.340]   about the military.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.660]   The rules are in place for a reason.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.420]   They're written in blood, I get all that.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.260]   But we're so constrained sometimes,
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.540]   I think that was just all coming into fruition
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.260]   that seventh grade year.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.220]   And I enjoyed going wild, like, it was just fun.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.860]   And frankly, we weren't, these fistfights
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.340]   and this trouble wasn't like going to get some kid.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.300]   Those other kids wanted the wildness too, you know?
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.900]   And so, but the school didn't want that.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.780]   And then I went out for wrestling that year
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.420]   and I could put it all into the wrestling room
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.380]   and it was awesome.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.140]   - Before we talk about wrestling
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.520]   and why it was so meaningful as a channel for you,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.540]   a little bit of neurobiology or else I wouldn't be
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.780]   Andrew Huberman, there's a really interesting phenomenon
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.900]   that one observes in both animals and humans,
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.380]   which is that somewhere around adolescence,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.260]   when the hormone surge begins, but even before that,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.900]   there's a phenomenon called dispersal.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.780]   It's very different than fighting per se
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.700]   or sexual activity per se.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.580]   It's a literal dispersal from one's home environment
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.780]   or an animal's a nest in which animals and humans,
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.700]   and we're animals after all,
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.580]   start forging new environments in a very,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.100]   as you pointed out, chaotic way.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.020]   It's not organized, it's a little nuts.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.460]   And biologists and neurobiologists in particular
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.900]   have observed changes in neural circuitry that drive this.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.740]   So some of it's hormonal, but a lot of it is the brain
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.420]   taking all this input that one has been exposed to,
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.060]   sun, earth, food, others, social interactions,
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.280]   and starting to essentially throw the different paints,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.420]   the different colors of paint together
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.340]   and just trying things.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.440]   Some kids are more prone to this than others.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.540]   Certainly has a hormonal component.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.380]   Boys and girls tend to do this differently,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.540]   but they both do it.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.380]   And psychologists and neurobiologists
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.460]   see this as a fundamental shift in our underlying circuitry.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.420]   So just a little bit of food for thought
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   to put what you just described in context.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.140]   With that said, tell us about wrestling.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.780]   - I mean, Andrew, in many ways, like I said,
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.260]   that was the first inflection point.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.260]   It was like immediate, I mean, immediate uptake.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.500]   Within a week, I knew this was my thing.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.540]   Maybe the first practice.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.700]   - What do you think it was?
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.680]   - So when I was younger, my aunt and uncle,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.100]   when I was like seven years old,
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.320]   they started taking me to road races.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.540]   And I'm sure, just running races,
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.260]   one mile and 5K races when I was really small kid.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.100]   - For you to run.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.260]   - Mm-hmm, to run with them.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.740]   They were into the road racing thing
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.380]   back in the day when it was brand new,
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.760]   you know, the '80s.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.380]   I'm 48, so I was born in '75.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.820]   So I was seven, eight years old at the time.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.300]   And I was into like, obviously, can I win this race?
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.300]   I just, the pain of the effort was so comfortable.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.400]   And then, this is kind of silly,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.640]   but like I won the PT competition
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.200]   at like the Boy Scouts thing in Audubon Park.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   - PT is physical.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.200]   - Yeah, physical training, physical training.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.880]   And so I won like the, whatever,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.080]   when I was young in Boy Scouts or something.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.240]   And then it just snowballed.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   Then I was just like, the physical activity still today is,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.400]   I mean, if someone said,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.600]   "What are you really in love with?"
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.660]   It's that.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.280]   And so when I walked into the wrestling room,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.720]   it was so extreme compared to anything else
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.120]   I had ever done.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.280]   Football, baseball, whatever.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.840]   I never really liked any of those sports.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   I played them all, but I didn't like them.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.000]   And always, my dad wrestled in high school and college.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.360]   And we were, you know, always rough and tumble
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.320]   in that regard.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.480]   And I even have a couple of buddies in the teams,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.080]   you know, who obviously were college wrestlers.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.480]   There's a lot of wrestlers in the teams.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.180]   And people would always joke about how we're so handsy.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.120]   You know, our hands are always on each other.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.720]   And that was just a thing for us.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   Like, I loved the close contact.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760]   I loved the fight of it.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.900]   What I really love about combat sports,
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.700]   'cause I boxed in high school between wrestling seasons,
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.480]   was the respect.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.000]   - Tell me more about that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.600]   - You just don't have, there are some, of course.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.960]   Like, you can see guys hyping it up and doing their thing
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.780]   in UFC these days, and that's totally fine.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.440]   But for the most part, if you have fighters of any type,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.860]   like in a setting, when they don't have to do, you know,
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.340]   the stuff for TV and whatnot, they respect each other.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.820]   Because, and they respect the effort.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.020]   And because you know what it takes.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.220]   And you know how hard it is to face another man
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.440]   in the middle of a mat with no equipment,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.140]   and nowhere to run, and no timeouts, and no one to tap in.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.140]   That's extreme, you know?
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.620]   And it may not seem like high school wrestling is extreme,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.740]   but as you just mentioned, something about, you know,
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.700]   development when you're 14 and you're facing another,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.500]   like, that's the first time.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.660]   Is someone trying to take your life?
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.380]   No, they're not, but it feels that way.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.100]   And then you go and you put in all these hours of training,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.980]   and you don't eat during the week,
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.780]   and you run stadiums, or you run levies,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.020]   and, you know, fireman's carries, and all of it,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.580]   while you're not eating and making weight,
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.500]   and you're in the sauna.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.420]   And it's just a very tough thing to do, combat sports.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.940]   And I love the respect that it engenders
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.420]   between the people who do it.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.180]   - I think it was Sam Sheridan who wrote "A Fighter's Heart."
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.060]   An excellent book.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.340]   And for anyone, male or female, any age,
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.940]   who's interested in the human spirit,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.380]   I recommend "A Fighter's Heart,"
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.700]   because it's about the different fight sports,
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.700]   but it's really about the path of self-discovery
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.740]   that occurs in various martial arts.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.580]   And as you said, like,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.020]   especially boxing is very gentlemanly.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.020]   You touch gloves, you start, you know,
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.340]   then the bell goes off, you go to your corner.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.420]   Like it's, you know, sometimes people lose it,
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.580]   bite off people's ears and things like that.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.460]   But for the most part, the sport is very structured.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.620]   As you were doing this, what was happening with school?
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.140]   Did it help your academic studies?
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.700]   Did it keep them more or less the same?
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.540]   And how did your family and your peer group
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.660]   view what you were doing?
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.100]   Were you considered strange for liking wrestling so much?
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.300]   I mean, you're dieting, right?
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.260]   You're a young male dieting
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.660]   for purpose of sport and performance.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.500]   You're sitting in saunas,
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.060]   you're running wrapped in plastic bags, all this.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.260]   Like, I mean, a good friend of ours
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.580]   who was also in the SEAL teams once said to me,
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.300]   he said, "You know, wrestlers are different."
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.220]   And I think he meant "different" in quotes.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.860]   - Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.380]   You know, school, my grades immediately went up.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.660]   Andrew was like, "Oh my gosh, the discipline of all of it."
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.940]   My grades were always better in wrestling season
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.140]   than out of wrestling season.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.980]   - Interesting.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.340]   - Like when I was cut loose out of the structure,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.300]   then it wasn't good.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.820]   And, you know, between seventh and eighth grade
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.700]   and all that, I didn't have any crazy shenanigans going on.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.260]   I wasn't gonna get kicked out of school, whatever.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.460]   I was doing normal stuff for the age, but-
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.940]   - So the fight stopped.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.500]   - Totally, totally.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.540]   'Cause I could put it into the wrestling space, you know?
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.180]   And I think, I grew up obviously in New Orleans,
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.140]   and I think, you know, down there,
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.620]   it's baseball, football, basketball.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.580]   Wrestling is not.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.700]   I mean, I was lucky to wrestle in college at all
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.980]   because it wasn't like Iowa was looking to recruit me.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.660]   You know, they have plenty of people to recruit
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.840]   and they don't need any Louisiana wrestlers.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.740]   Although Daniel Cormier grew up, like, north of the lake.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.460]   He was four years younger.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.540]   I was telling this to somebody.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.620]   We don't know each other.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.900]   I'd love to meet him.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.820]   Super impressive athlete.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.820]   We heard that, hey, there's some kid up in the North Shore,
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.380]   I think is where he grew up, whooping everybody's ass.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.460]   And his name is Daniel Cormier.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.500]   And then, you know, obviously the rest is history.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.160]   But the sport is not big in Louisiana,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.100]   which is all to say that we were kind of a unicorn.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.500]   We had, it was very odd at my high school specifically,
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.660]   we had one coach, his son, either national runner-up.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.740]   His name was Willie Gatson.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   Willie passed away.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.540]   I think his son ended up at Iowa State.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.940]   And within the last five or six years
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.980]   was either a national champ or a runner-up.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.980]   Willie, when I was in eighth grade, Andrew,
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.680]   Willie was at my high school.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.900]   Like, I have no idea how Willie Gatson
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.800]   ended up in New Orleans,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.540]   but we ended up with this cluster of wrestlers
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.220]   at that time with the right coaching.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.980]   And a few kids were going to junior college
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.360]   and coming back and wrestling in college and coming back.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.660]   And there were three or four guys,
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.260]   I remember specifically in eighth grade,
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.160]   'cause I started, at least in the junior high ranks,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.220]   I started to take off my second year.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.260]   These guys would abuse me in the wrestling room.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.420]   They were seniors in high school.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.140]   I was 112 pounds or 132 pounds my freshman year.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.580]   And they would just, in my eighth grade year,
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.540]   and they would just abuse me.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.680]   - Define abuse.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.940]   - In all the legal, normal wrestling ways.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.620]   Like, there's the, wrestling gets broken up,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.460]   obviously, by weight.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.900]   You got the heavyweights on one end of the room,
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.280]   the lightweights on the other end of the room,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.720]   and the young kids stay with the young kids
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.280]   for the most part.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.160]   And a few of these guys would drag me down
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.100]   to the varsity end,
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.440]   and I would wrestle with the middleweights,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.160]   and they would beat the shit out of me.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.040]   And eventually you get to the point where you're like,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.000]   "Fuck this, I had enough."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.960]   You know, and that's when sort of things started to turn.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.640]   But I think that wrestlers are different.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.660]   And my peer group,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.280]   one or two of my really good friends wrestled,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.920]   but most of them played other sports.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   And so, but in every sense of the word,
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.200]   life got better for me because of that sport.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.760]   It changed my life.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.040]   - So you wrestled all through high school?
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.080]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.300]   - At that point, were you discovering relationships, girls?
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.360]   Were you partying?
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.260]   Were you a drinker, used drugs?
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.680]   - No drugs.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.920]   I mean, it's New Orleans, right?
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.440]   It's like one of the things that was tough.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.900]   I'm glad I got out of the city, frankly,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.760]   because it was party time outside the season.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.680]   Yeah, girls, girlfriends, normal stuff in that regard.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.120]   Lots of drinking, lots of ratting the streets,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.640]   you know, in those days in the '90s.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.440]   - But you kept it inside the lane lines.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.280]   - Oh, totally.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.560]   - It sounds like no drunk driving, no arrests.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.520]   - We did a little bit of that,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.960]   but nothing crazy in that regard.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.520]   I think I understood the consequences
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.560]   and I really cared about my career.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.160]   I really wanted to wrestle in college.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.640]   My grades were excellent.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.800]   My SAT score's not so much,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   but I started winning really fast.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.680]   And, you know, my last two years in high school,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.960]   I was 89 and O, and I almost won my sophomore year.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.920]   So I was runner up in the state my sophomore year.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.280]   I always joke with the boys,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.720]   all my boys are way better athletes
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.920]   than I ever could think about being.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.740]   - Your sons?
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.800]   But in eighth grade, I made varsity
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.440]   and it was like, was it eighth grade?
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.760]   Yeah, and I lost like 75% of the matches, you know,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.040]   but you just grind it out
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.960]   and it's how I got into the Naval Academy,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.840]   which is a whole nother story, but.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.720]   - So let's talk about that.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.380]   So you finished high school.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.080]   You head to the Naval Academy.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.760]   Why the Naval Academy?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.820]   - There's actually a crazy story behind this,
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.720]   which maybe we'll circle back to, but,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:43.800]   the summer, gosh, I had forgotten
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.720]   that this started in seventh grade too.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   The summer between my seventh and eighth grade year,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   my grandfather was too young to join the Navy
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.600]   and he wanted to go to the Naval Academy
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.760]   during World War II.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.520]   And he lied to the recruiter
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.360]   and he got into the Merchant Marines.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.820]   His, I'm pretty sure, first cousin,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.640]   my uncle and my cousins are like first cousins once removed.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.880]   My uncle, Jim Therrell,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.000]   was at a family reunion in Mississippi,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.200]   which we were at.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.440]   And he didn't mention the Naval Academy.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.340]   Family reunion ends, they all go home.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.780]   And he starts sending me Naval Academy paraphernalia.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.220]   I knew nothing about the military.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.660]   And I just thought about it, you know,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.820]   and he would send me stuff.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.700]   You know, you didn't, we didn't have the internet, right?
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.140]   He's sending these booklets.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.780]   - And you don't like authority.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.620]   - No.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.500]   - I have not been in the military,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.380]   but I've done some work with y'all.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.780]   And there's a lot of hierarchy and authority.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.900]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.120]   The truth, Andrew, is like, it was just,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.460]   it just seemed exciting.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.140]   I wasn't really thinking about the implications
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.720]   as 18 year olds, you know, it looked very exciting to me.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.140]   And having gotten some professional help
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.060]   in the intervening years,
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.980]   what I really think was a big part of it
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.580]   was my parents got divorced my senior year in high school
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.180]   and the family unit just blew up, right?
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.860]   And so it also represented an escape, you know,
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.500]   get out and go get your life out of the New Orleans
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.620]   and just go, just go do something.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.060]   - Were you a part of that,
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.860]   that obviously you were a part of the family
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.380]   that got divorced.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.740]   Was it chaotic?
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.300]   Was it controlled?
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.480]   You and I are the exact same age.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.880]   We're both 48, born in '75.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.040]   Back then it was a lot less common for people being,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.740]   they called them broken homes back then.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.580]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.020]   - You know, nowadays I don't think they call it that.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.060]   Everyone just cites the statistic that, you know,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.060]   more than half of marriages end in divorce
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.820]   as if it perhaps to normalize it,
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.120]   but that's more than half.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.580]   Do you recall feeling distraught about that
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.660]   or was it just kind of the natural consequence
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.300]   of something you had observed a long time?
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.580]   You're like, oh, that kind of makes sense.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.900]   - No, it was a shock to me.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.740]   It wasn't a shock to my older sister.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:07.980]   I just remember, this was the thought at the time.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.320]   This was like seared in my brain.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.860]   This has nothing to do with me.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.780]   That wasn't like some sophisticated view.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.500]   It was mostly, fuck this, I'm not dealing with this.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.900]   I have my own life.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.440]   They're going to have to do what they're going to do,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.380]   meaning my parents.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.780]   I'm getting the hell out of here.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.520]   - Not a bad mindset for a kid at that stage.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.780]   If it had been four years younger,
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.060]   that might not be the best mindset,
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.020]   but as you're heading off to college,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.380]   that's a reasonably healthy mindset,
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.380]   as opposed to getting enmeshed in the,
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.300]   what happened and this and that.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.020]   Can I ask you, at that stage,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.060]   so you're 17, 18 years old at that point.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.460]   Were you journaling at that point?
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.300]   - No.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.780]   - No, no journaling, no introspective work.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.620]   - Zero.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.760]   - No school psychologists.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.500]   No thinking about or talking about your feelings.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   It's wrestling, Naval Academy, social things, school, SATs.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.300]   Like very standard.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.540]   We're almost like talking like a superficial list
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.340]   of like what happens at the end of high school in 1992.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.660]   - And Andrew, it's the word superficial,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.120]   and I carried this forward for years,
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.520]   which I'm sure we'll talk about here in a second.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.840]   Those binary focus areas,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.960]   like I was literally just going after them at full steam,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.840]   stronger, faster, more intensity with zero introspection,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.320]   no excavation of 'cause of the psychology of anything.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.760]   Just full steam ahead, like let's go.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.320]   - No meditation, no breath work.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   - Zero.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.500]   Which was not adaptive in the long run.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   And we'll get to how that played out in the long run.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.520]   But nonetheless, you got into the Naval Academy.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.480]   - Didn't first.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.320]   - Okay.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.160]   - So I applied.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.240]   I get, you know, my uncle's doing all this stuff.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   Anyway, I applied and I didn't,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.920]   I still have the letter of the thanks,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.880]   but no thanks, you know, you're not qualified.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.920]   - How'd that hit you?
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.720]   - At the time, it hit me kind of like everything I did
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.800]   when that age, when it didn't work out.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.160]   Admittedly, Andrew, it was like,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.760]   there's gotta be a way around this.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   Like, shit has to work out.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.400]   But it feels terrible, right?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.280]   Like, you have a moment of what do we do?
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.360]   And my kids have heard the story a million times.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.520]   My wife was a blue chip swimming recruit for Navy.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.440]   And so she was into the Naval Academy
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.400]   when she was at the beginning
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.960]   of her senior year of high school, right?
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.160]   - What's a blue chip?
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.360]   - I mean, in my understanding,
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.080]   a blue chip is like you are at the very top of the list
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.800]   and the coaches put you straight into the admission cycle
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.320]   saying, "Nobody else gets in until this person does first."
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.200]   - So they wanted her, they didn't want you.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.000]   - Not only was she a blue chip and I was,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.600]   and I got the no, I guess,
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.400]   well, the wrestling coach called me
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.720]   a couple of weeks after my no, which is now in May.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.960]   I'm about to graduate from high school.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.040]   I'm not accepted anywhere.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.840]   - You only applied one place.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.800]   - Actually two, which you may bust out laughing
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.400]   when I tell you what the other one is,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.760]   because no internet.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.200]   I got a mailer in a pamphlet from Stanford,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.920]   the wrestling coach.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.840]   I didn't know what Stanford was.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.240]   I had no idea that the college was even prestigious.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.080]   I didn't know they had a wrestling team.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.360]   I filled out the application and wrote the letter thing
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.520]   and I sent it into Stanford.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.960]   Of course, never heard back from them,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.360]   but I applied to two places,
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.040]   Stanford and the US Naval Academy.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.240]   - Well, for those that follow wrestling-
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.200]   - I didn't get into either.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.840]   - Right, that's a great story.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.160]   And I'll just briefly mention that a few years ago,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.320]   there almost wasn't a wrestling team at Stanford.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.600]   They had plans to cut the wrestling team
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.280]   despite having a NCAA champion at Stanford.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.440]   But the power of people gathering and petitioning works
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.880]   and wrestling and a few other sports
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.440]   that were being cut from the curriculum were spared.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.280]   - It's amazing.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.120]   - Or rescued.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.000]   - So happy to see that.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.320]   - Yeah, so Stanford does have a wrestling team.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.020]   - So the coach, back to how I ended up getting in,
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.440]   I appreciated my college coach called
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.760]   and he said, "I'm recruiting.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.580]   I have one more spot at the prep school,
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.480]   which is in Newport, Rhode Island.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.280]   I'm recruiting another kid from Pennsylvania.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.040]   If he takes that spot, then I don't have anything left."
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.240]   And we were exploring going to prep school
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.940]   and stuff like that, oblique ways to get in.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.120]   And he called me sometime in May,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.080]   like right around graduation and said,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.520]   "Can you be in Newport in July?"
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.560]   That kid went to, I think he went to Lehigh.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   And I went to the prep school.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.640]   - In Newport, Rhode Island.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.840]   - Yeah, in Newport for a year.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.680]   - I've been there.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.520]   It's a nice place.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.340]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.180]   - Yeah.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.440]   - And so you wrestle for, I mean, you do school.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.520]   You know, you're in, West Point has a prep school
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.920]   and Colorado Springs has a prep school.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.080]   And so we joked that my wife was first person
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.920]   in our class accepted and I was last,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.260]   which is highly possible actually.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.660]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.160]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.120]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.800]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.520]   every day since 2012.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.960]   And indeed that's true.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.240]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.880]   once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.800]   and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.440]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.360]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.720]   And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.360]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.280]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.560]   it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.200]   and especially when I'm busy.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.440]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.760]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.720]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.520]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.560]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.120]   just report feeling better.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.400]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.080]   because it supports gut health and of course,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.280]   gut health supports immune system health and brain health.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.400]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.660]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.220]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.360]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.720]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.040]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.240]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240]   and physical health.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.520]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.920]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.340]   to claim a special offer.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.740]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.400]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.820]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.120]   So you're in Newport.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.320]   Does that have a portal to the Naval Academy?
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.640]   - Yeah, if you graduate prep school,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.440]   you're straight into the Naval Academy.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   Like they fully expect you to be there the next year.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.200]   - When junior year rolled around
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.040]   and senior year rolled around of high school,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.640]   didn't anyone pull you aside and say,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.680]   "Hey, you might wanna like apply to a few other places.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.100]   You might wanna consider what you do
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.280]   if this doesn't work out."
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.320]   What did they assume you were gonna do?
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.300]   They just head into the city of New Orleans and bus tables?
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.080]   - Zero guidance, Andrew, really, like from my high school.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   And I think the ecosystem I was in,
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.700]   like people just didn't really know how to do that.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.040]   You know, how to apply to schools.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.760]   I mean, my parents obviously helped
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.560]   when I applied to the Naval Academy.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.520]   But when I look at the system that kids go through now
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.080]   to go, you know, their process
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.280]   to find the best college experience,
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.080]   I never had one conversation with a guidance counselor
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.500]   about what to do.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.620]   I just didn't.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.820]   I mean, I just got very lucky.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.900]   A few people, my high school wrestling coach intervened,
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.020]   I think at some point,
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.180]   and called the Naval Academy to speak to the coach
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.400]   to say, "You should give this kid a chance."
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.580]   But he didn't, they didn't know who he was, you know?
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.740]   I'm so lucky and so fortunate that I ended up
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.760]   where I ended up.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.340]   It's why I took it so seriously.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.860]   Like the focus with which I applied my time
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.060]   in high school, I took that to 10X degree
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.660]   when I got to Newport, because I knew this was my chance.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.940]   - There's something magical to that.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.780]   I can relate to that.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.420]   So you're in Newport, and describe what a day was like.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.460]   Is it all wrestling?
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.200]   You're taking general education classes
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.500]   like one does in the first two years of university?
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.060]   - Yep, so the way the prep school is set up
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.880]   for the Naval Academy is they're basically teaching you
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.780]   the first semester of the Naval Academy.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.540]   So you take calculus, physics, chemistry,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.980]   I think you take an English class, et cetera.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.200]   And you go through like a pretty hellacious
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.500]   first couple of weeks, 'cause you're away from the flagpole
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.820]   where no one can hear you scream.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.740]   You know, you're up in Newport,
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.160]   you're not in Annapolis where everyone's watching.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.820]   And you do a couple hellacious weeks for an 18-year-old
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.460]   who's never been in the military before.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.380]   - So you're in the military, technically,
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.220]   if you go to this school.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.700]   - You're actually enlisted in the Navy.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.220]   - Okay, so they own you to some extent.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.060]   - Yeah, yeah, they do.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.420]   And then you do--
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.580]   - You're wearing uniforms, you're jogging in the morning,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.300]   you're doing salutes and marching.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.140]   - Yep, the whole nine.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.820]   - And bugling, they're doing taps in the evening.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.660]   - Yep, all of it.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.500]   - Got it.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.060]   - Yep, and you live, there's 300 people at the prep school.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.220]   It's distributed basically amongst folks
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.060]   coming from the fleet.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   So guys who did four or five years in the military somewhere
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.980]   and they're coming into the Naval Academy from the fleet.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.660]   And then athletes and then sort of a mixture
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.740]   of other folks who need a little extra school, right?
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.500]   And so, and then you do a full school year.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.580]   You're competing.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.780]   It's basically a red shirt year.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.420]   That's not a red shirt year.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.940]   I competed up and down the East Coast
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.020]   against all the other prep schools
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.820]   and you finish that year in May.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.620]   And then you're done with the preps.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.900]   The prep year is fine.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.860]   It's a little bit of a shock when you're 18, but it's fine.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.980]   - Always been curious about these military schools
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.980]   and the people that go to them
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.900]   and what happens to people there.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.300]   Did you have any sense of patriotism
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.940]   prior to arriving at this prep school?
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.420]   And did that sense of patriotism,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.620]   you know, I'm talking like love of country,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.740]   understanding the history of our country
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.220]   and its position in the international landscape,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   are you thinking about that stuff?
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.740]   Are they feeding you that?
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.380]   Or is it really like wrestling, get through the march,
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.860]   shower up, go to the next thing?
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   Is it very like plug and chug?
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.340]   - No, no, the feeding of, and I really appreciated this,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.380]   the feeding of those concepts starts when you get there.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.740]   But I was deer in the headlights.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.500]   And you're like, I didn't think about my life
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.020]   in this way at all when I was headed there.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.820]   I mean, what you get very early,
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:27.380]   because the school very quickly starts to bring
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.180]   really high level accomplished people,
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.900]   colonels, admirals, whatever generals
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.940]   to expose you to this people.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.020]   I do remember sitting there within weeks,
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.660]   like this is way bigger than I thought it was
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.660]   in terms of how serious this situation is, you know?
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.900]   And how serious this ecosystem of people take this,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.100]   because I didn't have, my dad wasn't an admiral.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.900]   He was a welder in New Orleans, you know,
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.260]   I didn't understand the bigness of it.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.740]   - One of the reasons I ask this is that various times
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.180]   throughout my life, I've had this experience
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.180]   of like seeing people close to me doing incredible work.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.660]   You know, like when I was a postdoc at Stanford,
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.780]   I had Nobel prize was given that one week
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.180]   to the guy next door to me.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.100]   So you see him in the morning
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.420]   and like you're hearing it on the radio.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.260]   And obviously I didn't have that kind of stature
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.140]   or talent in science.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.380]   I think I'm a good scientist,
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.060]   but good enough to get tenure at Stanford.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.420]   But then there are levels within the game.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.340]   But there is something very special to the experience
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.820]   of having people close to you physically
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.700]   and in the same ecosystem as you described it,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.740]   achieving amazing things.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.940]   I also saw this in skateboarding.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.460]   I mean, there were a lot of, let's just say,
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.020]   failures to integrate with normal life.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.900]   But there are also some guys that I grew up with
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.180]   who started companies and set world records
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.420]   and had their pro models.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.260]   And then if you zoom out from that and you go,
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.340]   wait, I'm in this community,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.100]   it changes one's self view about what's possible.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.780]   So I think that's what you're describing.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.100]   And I think it's such an important thing
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.260]   for people to experience at some point,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.460]   even if the goal isn't to be at kind of world scale,
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.500]   you know, for people to realize that the town they grew up
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.780]   in, the family they grew up in, that context can expand.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.900]   And so do you recall being at this prep school
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.620]   and kind of third personing yourself and thinking like,
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.940]   well, I'm Coleman Ruiz, I'm from New Orleans.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.540]   I went from this to this to this,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.140]   the way you've been describing it.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.380]   And I'm here and they're like,
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.220]   I'm around some incredibly impressive people and I'm here.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.500]   Like once you make that recognition that you're there,
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.180]   a whole bunch of things can open up.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.500]   - No, I actually came at it from the opposite way.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.380]   And this has been a hard thing for me my whole life.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.860]   And I have to watch out for this perspective,
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.860]   is I felt like every day I had to wake up
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.100]   and earn my place there.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.300]   I was never good enough for myself ever.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:57.260]   So next day up is a restart to prove myself again
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.820]   on whatever standard I'm picking that day, right?
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.460]   Looking back on it, I realize it was somewhat arbitrary
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.620]   because it was just day by day.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.140]   I didn't think I'm Coleman Ruiz, I made it here.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.660]   Look, I'm part of this.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.340]   I was afraid, like Mike Tyson talks about
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.460]   being afraid every time.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.140]   I was afraid every day.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.060]   And I fought for like a position in this place every day.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.980]   Now that was adaptive in some regard, right?
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.820]   - Very.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.900]   - Because to me it was, let's go.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.740]   Like today's another new day and it's 100% all in, full go.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.980]   I hope everybody's ready.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.420]   - Do you ever recall falling asleep at night
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.860]   and thinking like, well, like--
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.700]   - I had a good day.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.880]   - I had a good day, or I'm scared,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.380]   they're gonna discover I can't keep up.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.780]   - Totally. - Or I can't keep up.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.340]   - All the time. - So a lot of fear.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.180]   I mean-- - Yeah.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.060]   - Yeah, a lot of fear. - All the time.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.220]   And some of it I do, I genuinely know
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.020]   and believe in Andrew that it was well-intentioned.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.380]   Like I wanted to do a good job for the group,
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.020]   whatever group I was in, my platoon, my squad,
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.660]   in the case of the prep school.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.300]   You know, that first experience.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:14.340]   I mean, I was talking about this with my wife the other day
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.740]   just 'cause stories come up.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.860]   You know, we had a 25th reunion at the Naval Academy
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.980]   and this kind of thing.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   And I was a really good runner for my group in high school,
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.180]   like the people I was around.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.580]   I ran cross country when I was younger.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.380]   And anyway, I did, I suppose I'm going the other direction,
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.900]   I sort of did have some level of confidence in my ability.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.740]   And then I got there
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.580]   and like all these college cross country runners,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.700]   like my son is now, just crushing me.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.460]   And I think sadly, because it was just sort of in me,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.020]   that fed my fear.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.580]   Like shit, I thought I was better than this.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.860]   Clearly I suck.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.820]   I have to get to their level.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.660]   So I did have a very well-intentioned excitement around,
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.340]   just do a good job with the people you're around.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.180]   There's something fun to that and wild,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.580]   you know, as we spoke about.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.600]   But I was operating out of fear for decades.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.540]   - But there was a,
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.740]   I need to get to their level statement in there.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.860]   It wasn't, I can't keep up.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.700]   I better find a different path.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.140]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.420]   I knew I could get to their level with enough work.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.220]   - Was that something that your father or your mother
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.740]   or both had instilled in you that-
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.420]   - Oh, for sure, yeah.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.380]   And my high school wrestling coach was,
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.080]   let's call it maybe from the old school.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.020]   If you worked hard enough, you could get there.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.700]   - So this is the essence of growth mindset
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.260]   long before Charles Dweck coined the phrase
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.180]   to growth mindset.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.980]   It's there, I'm not there yet.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.020]   - When I first read her book,
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.160]   like when people teach us to shit when we were kids.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.460]   - Yeah, well, some of us got it, some of us didn't.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.940]   And it can be very context dependent, right?
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.300]   I mean, I think that's one of the more important
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.220]   and often overlooked aspects of Carol's work
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.660]   and Ali Crum's work is that we can develop growth mindset
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.600]   in one domain of life, but then another domain of life,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.900]   we get kicked in the teeth once and we're like,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.720]   I can't do that.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.860]   There's a carve out where I can't function.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.660]   Some people do that, some people don't.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.420]   And we don't understand enough about it
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.220]   to understand whether or not it's a global circuit,
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.860]   and there's a lot of context.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.180]   But okay, so you're hanging in there at least,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.860]   you're surrounded by some very impressive people.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.780]   There's a lot of structure.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.460]   So we're a long way from the pre-wrestling days.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.300]   - Oh yeah.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.540]   - Yeah, this is the opposite of chaos.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.380]   - Totally.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.380]   - This is structure.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.980]   - Yeah, you're told what to do every five minutes
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.300]   more or less.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.020]   - And this is scary feelings, fear is a scary feeling,
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.740]   but you're channeling it.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.660]   And you said the unit of the day became important.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.140]   It's like, what can I do today?
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.260]   You're not thinking about the week,
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.480]   you're not thinking about the season,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.620]   you're not thinking about becoming some war hero
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.580]   down the line, you're just 24 hours.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.420]   - Do the next day.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.140]   - Yeah, how was your self-care at that point?
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.660]   Or is that built into the system?
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.120]   - It's not built into the system and it was zero.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.140]   I mean, it really was Andrew, like it was the old school.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:15.160]   We were not doing anything sophisticated back then.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.400]   I mean, there was no, we stretched.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.720]   And in the grand scheme of things,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.700]   it's gonna sound weird because there still is a lot of
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.180]   primal nature to combat sports.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.880]   But in the grand scheme of things,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.420]   we were probably on the upper end of sophisticated,
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.020]   like wrestlers jump rope, they stretch, they do aerobics.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.380]   Been in a sauna since 1993.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.020]   It's like not purposeful,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.060]   not to cut weight in a garbage bag,
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   but there is some level of balancing out your training.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.260]   Wrestlers like to swim during the season
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.900]   because you're getting out of that hot room.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.020]   Like you end up accidentally doing some of these things,
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.460]   but there was no self-care.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.900]   - So you eventually go to the Naval Academy.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.720]   - '94.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.260]   - The actual Naval Academy,
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.540]   and that's where you met your wife.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.100]   - Yep, in '96, my sophomore year.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.580]   - So when you get there,
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.900]   what's different than the prep school?
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   - First of all, it's big in the macro,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.300]   not just geographically big
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.140]   or footprint square footage-wise, it's big.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.460]   The concept is big.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:31.500]   The superintendent of the school is a three-star Admiral.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.960]   You hear about his career, you're 19 years old, you meet.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.060]   So there's two incredibly important people in my life.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.100]   In those early years at the Naval Academy,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:50.740]   a guy named Doug Zembeck, who's dead now,
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.740]   who most people of my service time will know who he is.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:02.460]   When I was on my recruiting trip to the Naval Academy
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.980]   and I was in high school, this is complete accident.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.700]   Doug was a sophomore.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.140]   We call them youngsters at the Naval Academy.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.460]   He was a sophomore, and we're the same weight class.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.680]   So coach matched us up because it was my recruiting visit.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.600]   And my first, this is back to being wild,
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.660]   literally my first night on the grounds
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.260]   of the Naval Academy, I'm sleeping on Doug Zembeck's floor
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.980]   of his room with his other two roommates.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.580]   And sometime around three or 4 a.m., I get woken up.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.140]   It's like a bomb goes off.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.620]   There's, a bomb didn't go off,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:40.460]   but there's 12 other gorillas in the room, all wrestlers,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.380]   maybe one or two other guys.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.300]   And Doug is hustling.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.900]   I don't know any of these people, Andrew.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   Like I just met Doug the previous evening.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.120]   We just flew into town.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.380]   He wakes me up.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.140]   He's hustling me to get my shoes on.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.420]   Again, I'm just this high school kid.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.500]   And then within two to three minutes,
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.420]   all 15 of these gorillas bolt out of the room
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.420]   and Doug grabs me and I'm just following them, right?
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.020]   So we race out of Bancroft Hall.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.620]   It's maybe four in the morning, 3.34 in the morning.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.200]   We race out of Bancroft Hall, the barracks.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.540]   We run across the parking lot into Lejeune Hall.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.400]   And Lejeune Hall is the swimming facility
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.540]   and the wrestling room.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.540]   That's it.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.340]   That's the only thing that's in there, right?
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.380]   The doors, we run up to Lejeune Hall.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.180]   The doors of Lejeune Hall are locked
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.900]   with a chain on the outside.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.220]   And one of our, Doug pulls on the chain
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.540]   so that the doors open enough at the top
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.620]   that the 142-pounder can climb up
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.260]   and get inside that little gap in the doors
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.740]   and run over and open one of the doors that isn't chained.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.540]   - This is what you'll later do professionally.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.820]   - I still have, exactly.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.520]   And what I frankly did as a kid, like back in the day.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.700]   And so I'm terrified 'cause I don't know what's coming.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.300]   - You don't bother to ask, what are we doing?
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.380]   - There's no time.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.260]   There's just no time.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.420]   Like these guys are, to me, they're full-blown war heroes.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.220]   They're not, they're college kids, but I'm 17.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.580]   They're 21, all these wrestlers.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.700]   I'm hoping I'm gonna come here and be their teammate.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.880]   We run into Lejeune Hall, go to the second story.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.700]   We climb up the utility ladder where Public Works goes
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.100]   to get in the ceiling above
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.820]   the white foamy ceiling tile things.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.380]   So we're now on the catwalk
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.500]   where the HVAC guys would be working.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.100]   And I'm starting to get a sense of what's coming.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:35.900]   We go a couple of feet down the catwalk, everyone stops.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.540]   Someone reaches over the catwalk
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.900]   and pulls one chalky ceiling tile out.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.740]   So now you can look over the edge of the catwalk
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.020]   and see right through the ceiling into the diving well.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.540]   Remember the diving well has a 10 meter platform.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:57.100]   And then we're another, I don't wanna over-exaggerate this.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.580]   We have to be another 20 feet into the ceiling.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.580]   - So you're above the diving board.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.700]   - Oh, we're way above the diving board.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.180]   We're five feet above the ceiling,
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.380]   which is 20 feet above the 10 meter.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.220]   - Got it.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   - Right, and so, and now I've realized what's happening.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.100]   And two or three wrestlers,
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.240]   you climb over the catwalk, get, you know, backwards,
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.260]   get your hands all the way down
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.580]   and then very lower yourself in a reverse pull-up
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.700]   so you don't kick the ceiling tile.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.620]   And three or four guys go and you can hear 'em
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.700]   hit the water after what is a terrifyingly long time
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.180]   when you're, you know, my age.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.540]   - Just in the dark.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.760]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.420]   No one's supposed to be in there.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.820]   And then one of the guys looks over.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.380]   When you're a recruit, you're called a drag.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:49.060]   And they're like, "Drag, you're up."
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.460]   And I'm lowering myself, Andrew,
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.820]   and I kick the adjacent ceiling tile
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.780]   and it hits the dive tank
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.260]   and it turns into pancake batter
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.820]   and goes to the bottom of the pool.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.740]   - Oh, my.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.740]   - And one of my teammates is like, "You motherfucker."
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.900]   One of my future teammates, you know, he's going nuts.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.900]   I drop, I live, and this is back to Doug.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.540]   I come up, Doug clearly goes behind me,
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.720]   but I don't hear him.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.500]   And one or two guys are going nuts.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.500]   You high school piece of shit.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.940]   Like, you're gonna go down to the 15 feet
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.780]   and pick it all up.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.820]   And Doug comes up and he just blasts everybody.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.860]   He's our responsibility.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.140]   This is not his fault.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.760]   We brought him here.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.400]   Like, just totally backs me up.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:41.520]   And then the rest of the visit happens.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.700]   I end up there.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.620]   Doug's now a senior.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.460]   I'm a freshman.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:50.060]   And he's just the legend.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.540]   He was all American.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.100]   And to this day, Andrew,
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.260]   you need to hear this loud and clear.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.080]   Like, for all the people you and I both know
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.540]   and the people I've been around,
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.740]   no other human in my life have I met
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.660]   with his physical and mental toughness, not even close.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.820]   The guy was born in the wrong century,
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.980]   is the way I'd describe him.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:14.980]   And he was like my mentor and he was my guy, you know?
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.780]   And he was killed in '07.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.820]   - Marie, we'll talk about Doug.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.900]   You've written about him.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.940]   - Yeah, he's unbelievable.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.540]   - So I feel like I know him a little bit, thanks to you.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.100]   We'll get around to that for sure.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.820]   I think people are getting a sense of where we're headed.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.060]   - So to answer your question about like that,
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.660]   the bigness of the Naval Academy,
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.800]   that's how it started for me.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.100]   Like, everything was just on steroids.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.900]   You know, all these kinds of people.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.360]   - I get the impression, at least up until now,
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.760]   that you just go with what's right in front of you.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.840]   - 100%.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.320]   - Like, there isn't a lot of pause and reflect.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   Although, your rudder is not haphazard.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.280]   It's not random.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.120]   - No.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.240]   - Well, yeah, I can say right now,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.600]   you and I are as similar as we may be in certain respects.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.080]   Like, we're very different in this way.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.640]   Like, there isn't like a foraging.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.720]   You know, in biology, we call them random walks.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.480]   You know, a lot of organization that comes out of biology
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.040]   is through random walks, like animal or human,
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.720]   like finds a node and moves.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   And life is like this.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.280]   Steve Jobs talked about not being able to connect the dots,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.080]   except in retrospect, and I subscribe to that.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.600]   And his life was a bit of a random walk,
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.660]   but that we're guided by some central beam of uniqueness.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.520]   Robert Greene, when he was on the podcast,
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.560]   talks about that.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.640]   Your beam is more narrow, it seems.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   And the propeller behind that beam is high RPM.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.120]   That's very clear.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   And what I'm not hearing here is like,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.560]   yeah, you know, at one point I paused
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.800]   and wondered whether or not I wanted to, you know,
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.640]   be here wrestling in the Naval Academy,
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.560]   or even like what I might do when I get out.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.880]   Am I gonna work for an investment firm?
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.860]   What am I gonna do?
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   Your horizon, it seems to be about 24 hours at that point.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.320]   - Yeah, I hope not anymore, but at that point.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.600]   - No, at that point, at that point.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.400]   I mean, I'm no psychologist,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.500]   but it just seems like you're,
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.240]   it's not like you're playing checkers,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   but you're optimizing for a fairly short horizon.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.300]   - There's no question that's right.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.100]   And the other part that was probably
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.400]   the most important to me, Andrew,
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.920]   was the person or the group.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.620]   Because this is gonna sound very arrogant,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.200]   but when I got to, I'm going to this prep school,
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.120]   I'm going to the Naval Academy.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.440]   I think on day one, I'm gonna literally meet
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.720]   the cream of the crop in the country.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.080]   And that was not the case.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.600]   And it was not the case at the Naval Academy.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.640]   And frankly, it wasn't the case in the teams either.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.160]   Like, I'm not saying I'm better than anybody,
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.420]   but I thought every single person,
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.180]   when I got to the Naval Academy,
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:00.320]   was gonna be entirely focused on whatever our mission was.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.120]   And I didn't even know what my mission was there, right?
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:06.640]   I just knew I was gonna be told what Wright looks like.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.800]   And Doug, not only did I meet him in high school
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.240]   and have the luck of having him as a teammate and a mentor,
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.520]   for me, he is what Wright looked like.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:21.240]   So a focused beam and a propeller running at high RPM
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.840]   with the right, quote unquote, swim buddy, so to speak,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.960]   was literally all I cared about.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.920]   That was it.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.680]   Everything else was white noise.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.200]   - Were there other interests at the time?
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.780]   I mean, presumably you listened to music
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.080]   every once in a while, but-
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.200]   - I mean, I would, whatever.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.840]   - But didn't fall in love with it?
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.960]   Didn't feel the need to pursue anything else,
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.560]   learn an instrument, do anything else?
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.160]   It was that narrow beam.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   - So you met your wife in '96?
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.800]   - Sophomore year at the Naval Academy, yeah.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.720]   - And was she as driven?
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.760]   Is she as driven?
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.240]   I mean, she's obviously a very talented swimmer,
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.800]   presumably works hard as well.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.120]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.520]   I didn't realize until a few years ago
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   that the both of you were military.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.000]   - Yeah, she definitely just different, different driven,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.840]   way smarter, way more,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.880]   you know, it's obviously not one-to-one for men and women,
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.640]   but way more successful by gradient standards.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.800]   She's in the Navy Hall of Fame.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.280]   She was Patriot League swimming champ.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.520]   She was on junior national triathlon team
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.880]   when she was 20, I think.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.600]   Really talented in every regard.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.400]   Ninth in our class, I think.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.160]   First female graduate, number one female graduate, our class.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.000]   - Tell me more about that.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.080]   How's that work?
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.280]   - You have a, I don't even know exactly how the grading,
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.440]   first of all, her grades are,
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.200]   her academic success is just remarkable.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.280]   And then you get a military grade
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.640]   and you get a physical grade, not for your athletics,
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.080]   I don't think, but it's like your PRT scores,
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.360]   which is your physical readiness test,
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.120]   all this military stuff you do.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   You get this other cluster of a grade
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.320]   that goes along with your academic grades.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.960]   And she was number nine in the class
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.240]   and the first female graduate based on that
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.120]   cluster of grading.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.760]   And I mean, she's an amazing person.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.120]   - Was her success in academics and swimming,
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.040]   was that part of what drew you to her?
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.160]   No.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.720]   - No, no, she was just nice and, you know.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.000]   I didn't really care about the achievement.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.360]   It certainly sounds like I care about achievement
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.200]   'cause of the narrow focus, but it wasn't really that.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.520]   You know, she was just really normal
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.240]   in a group of a lot of abnormal people, frankly.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.000]   Like there's some kooks at these schools, you know.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And I'm probably in that category, I don't know,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.920]   but everybody's just really different there.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.480]   You have this athlete group, you have, I mean,
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.800]   you know, Andrew, I mean, you went to Stanford.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.920]   I mean, some of the, you know,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.560]   the group of Naval Academy in West Point,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.120]   like these schools who produce
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.160]   like the Rhodes Scholar level person,
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.960]   like that cluster of group, like at Navy,
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.080]   I remember, they're super impressive.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.360]   I mean, and then there's the rest of us like doing our best,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.720]   getting pretty good grades and stuff,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.200]   but there's very different groups inside, you know,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.040]   the school.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.480]   - Yeah, yeah, I looked at some of my colleagues,
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.520]   like a former guest on this podcast, Allie Crum.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.760]   You know, she's incredible scientist,
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.920]   was a division one gymnast
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   and is a licensed clinical psychologist.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.720]   Also maintains a healthy relationship
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.000]   with children in the home.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.240]   Like, I just go, who are these people?
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.280]   You know, I mean, you know, every once in a while,
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.200]   we talk about the person with the quote unquote extra gear,
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.320]   you know, like some people just seem to have that extra gear
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.000]   and I don't want to take anything away from Allie
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.520]   or anyone else's incredible work ethic
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.840]   that goes with what people perceive as an extra gear.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   Who knows if they have an extra gear or not.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   I always just want to know what their parents did.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.120]   And it turns out Allie's parents,
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.240]   I hope I have this right,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:03.080]   but recollection of this is that her mother
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.120]   ran a theater group
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.560]   and her father was a martial arts teacher.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   So, you know, there's nothing that speaks
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.600]   to academics per se.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.560]   And I find that really important to me and to highlight
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.600]   because I think people hearing this conversation
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.760]   and hear about people like Allie's
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.440]   and other examples like that,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.720]   you think, oh yeah, you got to come from an academic family
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.480]   to end up at a top tier institution
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.080]   or to win a Nobel prize.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.160]   In fact, there are so many exceptions to that.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.960]   Or you have to be a natural athlete
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.440]   or be born with some genetic gift
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   or some extra gear, as it were, in order to succeed.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.160]   But I think so much of success
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.280]   is the thing that you seem to operationalize really quickly,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.040]   which is to really focus on that 24 hour horizon
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.720]   and where one has seen failure to just keep going.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.800]   I mean, a big part of it is just to keep going,
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.280]   but also to make sure that you're continuing to go
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.640]   in a direction that is adaptive and functional.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.600]   Because imagine had you not found wrestling
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.200]   and you had gotten into some group
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   where the metrics of success were around dealing weed
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.720]   or doing something, which back then was highly illegal,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.360]   now is varying levels of legality,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.120]   but where the points came back for effort
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.520]   in domains of life that could take you down into the gutter.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.520]   And you see this.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.640]   So I'm convinced that the work ethic
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.240]   is the fundamental piece, but there has to be that rudder.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.480]   And your rudder has to be pointed in the right direction.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   So along those lines, you meet Bridget.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.600]   - And was it instantaneous?
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.960]   - No, we kind of had a friendship first.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.800]   I felt like at least, we've discussed this.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.280]   I mean, I instantaneously enjoyed her company.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.760]   So I met Bridget in February of sophomore year.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.160]   I was on the campus of Naval Academy, it's called The Yard.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.880]   I was on The Yard all winter
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.920]   because the wrestling season is the shittiest time ever.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.040]   It crosses over the holidays.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.440]   You have to make weight during Thanksgiving.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.240]   You have to make weight during Christmas.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.360]   We were on campus, on The Yard,
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.640]   and it was easily waist deep snow.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.360]   And we were doing two a day practices.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.120]   Everybody else is home on vacation.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:17.040]   That winter, I considered leaving
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.600]   and thank goodness for no cell phones and stuff,
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.880]   because I didn't know how to leave.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.720]   It was like-
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.400]   - You considered leaving like leaving the Naval Academy.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.800]   - I was just, but it didn't have anything to do
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.280]   with the Naval Academy, really.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.480]   It had everything to do with that moment.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.600]   I was miserable.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.320]   Like I was making, I wrestled 190 my freshman year
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   and Doug graduated.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.680]   He was the 177 pounder.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.400]   So sophomore year, I dropped into his spot.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.560]   I went down to 177.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.720]   Fighting weight for me is like 193.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.000]   But back then, Andrew, I'm lifting a lot.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.600]   I was 210 to 215 in the off season
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.360]   and I cut to 177 sophomore year.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.600]   And I was just generally miserable.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.880]   And if it was easy to leave, I probably would have.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.320]   And then I met Bridget in February
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.880]   and I was like, "Fuck it, I'll stay."
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.680]   She's better than this place anyway.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.640]   - Having followed my high school girlfriend off to college
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.080]   and not gone to college when I got there,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.920]   I just lived in the parking lot outside her dorm room.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.760]   I can relate.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.880]   I probably wouldn't be sitting here today
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.920]   were it not for Eleni.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.120]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.680]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Plunge.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.880]   Plunge makes what I believe
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.680]   is the best self-cooling cold water plunge.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.760]   Over the last decade,
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.800]   and especially in the last five years,
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.080]   there's been an increasing amount of excitement
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.000]   about cold water plunging
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.840]   for sake of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.760]   And that's in large part
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.720]   because one of the most robust effects
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.520]   of cold water exposure are big increases in adrenaline,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.520]   also called epinephrine, and dopamine.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.280]   So while some people do cold water plunging
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.320]   in pursuit of increasing metabolism
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.840]   or reducing inflammation,
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.480]   it's really those big increases in adrenaline and dopamine
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   that lead to those long-lasting increases
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.520]   in alertness and feelings of wellbeing,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.240]   not just in the seconds or minutes after the cold plunge,
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.440]   but indeed for several hours afterwards.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.200]   I've been using a plunge for several years now,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.900]   typically first thing in the morning
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.920]   or after cardiovascular training.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.960]   I do agree that doing cold water plunging
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.760]   after a workout designed to generate hypertrophy
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.760]   or strength gains is not a good idea,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.920]   but doing cold plunging at the other times of day
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.840]   can be tremendously beneficial.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.720]   I use the version of plunge called the all-in ice bath,
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.520]   and plunge now also makes saunas
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.320]   that get up to 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.200]   I love how the plunge ice bath and sauna
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.920]   can both be controlled from an app on my phone
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.000]   so that if I'm headed home, I can turn on the sauna
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   and it'll be hot when I arrive.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.560]   So if you would like to try a plunge ice bath or sauna,
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.360]   you can go to plunge.com/huberman
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.880]   to get $150 off either product.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.900]   Again, that's plunge.com/huberman.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.660]   - So at what point did you decide
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.860]   you wanted to aim for the SEAL teams?
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.700]   - It's a great question.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.640]   I mean, things, you know, as compared to,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.160]   at a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps at prep school,
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.440]   who I thought, these are back to the first people
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.400]   you meet in this environment, Gunny Flynn.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.340]   And he was great, like he was super hard on us,
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.960]   but I obviously kind of love that.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.760]   And I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps,
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.840]   and Doug wanted to go into the Marine Corps.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.160]   I'm a freshman at the Naval Academy.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.600]   He's my wrestling partner.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.760]   Doug could literally tell me to jump off of a building.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   As long as he came with me, I'd do it, no problem,
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.520]   and enjoy it all the way down.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.860]   Doug was going into the Marine Corps.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.360]   I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.940]   And I did a summer training in Quantico
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.320]   between freshman and sophomore year.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.520]   And it was okay.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.580]   It was good, but I didn't love it.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.440]   And I met a couple other guys who were gonna compete
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.220]   for spots in the SEAL teams who were years ahead of me.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.460]   But to answer your question, junior year,
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.960]   you can sign up and say,
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.280]   "I wanna start competing for a billet."
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.640]   We had 16 spots in my class.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.680]   I think there's 32 spots these days.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.880]   You know, the force has grown since 9/11, obviously.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:09.540]   And I wanna say maybe 150 or so people,
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.440]   they put you through this weekend,
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.620]   overnight, two-day, hell two-day things at Navy.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:17.660]   Some people quit.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.520]   I don't know how many go to what we used to call mini-BUD/S
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.420]   in the summer between junior and senior year.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.760]   You go out to Coronado and BUD/S instructors,
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.600]   they still have it.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.960]   It's called something different.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.720]   You spend two weeks at the BUD/S compound
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.400]   and they run you through a mini-program.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.560]   - And say BUD/S for the,
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.480]   some folks listening to this won't know the acronym.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.240]   - The acronym is Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL School.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.080]   That's our school in Coronado.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.440]   - It's a screening process for who gets in, who doesn't.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.200]   - Yeah, and when you're at the Naval Academy,
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.800]   it's obviously different than guys coming
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.640]   into the enlisted ranks.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   You have this pool of people,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.340]   150-ish guys say they wanna go.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.240]   Sometime junior year, they run you through this weekend,
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.860]   pretty hard, at Navy,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.660]   'cause we have SEALs stationed at the Naval Academy.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.380]   And then, I'm just gonna guess, that goes from 150 to 80.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:08.320]   Maybe 80 guys go to the summer program in Coronado
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.040]   when you're still a midshipman at the Naval Academy.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.240]   I've never, maybe people have quit mini-BUD/S, I don't know.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.440]   But I don't know if I really saw anybody quit
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.560]   the two weeks we were out in Coronado.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.160]   And then you get graded on your performance and stuff.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.300]   And then you come back for senior year,
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.560]   and you go through a series of interviews
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.600]   with a bunch of SEALs who come out and do interviews,
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.640]   and you don't really know what you're doing.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.800]   And then they select down, I don't wanna, again, overdo it,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.640]   but it's probably seven, I don't know,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.560]   maybe 50 or 60 qualified guys.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.280]   They select you down to 16.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.960]   And so, to answer your question
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.420]   about when I got interested was,
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.480]   when I knew I didn't wanna go in the Marine Corps,
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.040]   I never, ever had the Top Gun fever thing.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.600]   I wasn't interested in flying.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.280]   I just wasn't interested in anything else,
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.620]   but something super physical.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.600]   And that seemed like the next best thing.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.160]   And because I grew up in New Orleans
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.880]   and spent a lot of time in the water,
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.140]   that wasn't intimidating.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.060]   That screens a lot of people out, obviously.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.440]   Yeah, and got selected in the group of 16,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.680]   and was at Bud's after graduation,
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.320]   a couple of months after graduation.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.880]   - There's been a lot put out into the world around Bud's.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.400]   People have seen the log carrying, and the boat carrying,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.360]   and the screaming of the instructors,
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.360]   and the running, and the clasped arms in the water,
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.160]   and hell week, no sleep, and on and on.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.280]   It's obviously tough.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.240]   It calls 85% of the people that go out there
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.040]   thinking that they are the absolute last person
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.400]   who would ever quit, ring the bell so to speak.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.220]   You obviously got through.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.740]   A while back, you mentioned to me three things
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.180]   that you think predict whether or not
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.520]   somebody's gonna get through Bud's.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.840]   And before you tell us what these are,
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.640]   I just will just tell people that yes, of course,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.360]   you made it through Bud's successfully
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.840]   and went into the teams.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.920]   Very successful career in the teams.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.280]   But you've also been a Bud's instructor.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.360]   So you've been on the other side of the equation too.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.520]   What are those three things?
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.340]   - Yeah, this was, as you know, this was very anecdotal,
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.420]   but it lined up.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:29.160]   When I was back there in '05 as an instructor,
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.680]   I feel like, we're not scientists, right?
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.680]   But I feel like we tried every correlating data poll
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.440]   that we could pull from pull-ups, to run times,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.320]   to you name it, to regions of the country
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.460]   that people grow up near water.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.040]   At least back then, nothing correlated.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.720]   And so I was a first phase OIC officer in charge.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.640]   And so our team in first phase,
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.520]   we can talk about what that is in detail if you want to,
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520]   but first phase is in charge of Hell Week.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.600]   You know, Hell Week's in the first two months of training.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.120]   And a couple of the guys said all this bullshit
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.980]   about this can get you through, that can get you through.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.840]   I bet that every single person we talked to
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.720]   out here on the Grindr has one of these three things.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.080]   They were a varsity athlete in high school or college,
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.400]   their parents are divorced,
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.160]   or they got suspended from school.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.480]   I guarantee it.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.440]   And we would walk around the Grindr and ask.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.600]   And I mean, you know, this isn't gonna pass
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.440]   an independent review board, but it's gotta be 90 to 95%.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.240]   - So that's incredible because, you know,
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.520]   so much has been made of BUD/S and Hell Week.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.840]   And just to just fill in a few of the blanks
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:37.920]   for those that aren't familiar,
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.720]   Hell Week is what, it's five nights, no sleep.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.440]   You get an hour or a couple minutes on one day,
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.000]   but you're basically in constant movement for about a week.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.840]   - You are.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.200]   - And that's when most people voluntarily ring the bell.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.240]   - And most of them do it before Wednesday.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.080]   - Okay.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.480]   And I know it's got chaotic components,
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.760]   guns going off, blasts.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.480]   It's got hard work, boring components,
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.320]   people trying to make it through it
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.520]   who have no sense of how long the run is gonna last
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.960]   or what's gonna happen.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.360]   And you hear all this stuff like, okay,
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.600]   you just don't quit or you just go meal-to-meal.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.160]   But what you just described is really interesting.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.560]   Let's break those three things down
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.640]   because playing a varsity sport has certain elements.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.480]   Having divorced parents has certain elements
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.360]   and getting suspended in school has certain elements.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:33.120]   Let's start with divorced parents first.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.640]   As varsity sport, I think we can probably just quickly say,
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.760]   okay, there's structure.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.880]   You have to listen to somebody.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.080]   You have to be able to push yourself.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.160]   You have to have some level of physical competence.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.000]   - Coachable.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.080]   - Coachable, mental competence, work with others.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.800]   So there's something there, right?
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.760]   And you presumably have to go through junior varsity
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.600]   to get there.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.920]   So there's some oomph and required in any event.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.040]   But the divorced parents pieces was surprising to me.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.960]   Still is.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.200]   What, you have divorced parents.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.040]   So do I.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.840]   Divorces occur for any number of different reasons.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.840]   - What in the world do you think is the consequence of,
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:15.520]   or of a divorced household that would predict so well,
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.680]   at least in this back of the envelope measurement
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.920]   that you made, but as an instructor,
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.040]   that people would get through
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.120]   this excruciatingly difficult period of time?
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.240]   - For me, it was one thing specifically.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.180]   I felt like I was alone if I didn't have the team.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.760]   So I don't know what it would be for other people,
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.920]   but I was like, if I don't have this team,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.360]   then what team do I have?
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.440]   So I'm not leaving.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.760]   You could crank up the cold and misery
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.240]   as high as you fucking want, but I'm not leaving.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.360]   - Yeah, that hits deep.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.240]   I didn't do buds.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.440]   I didn't even know what the SEAL teams were,
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.880]   but I certainly know the feeling of looking outside
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.960]   of the household for a sense of family and belonging
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.280]   and the feeling that like, I'd much rather,
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.720]   like from almost from a place of joy,
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.480]   like I'd much rather die for these people,
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.840]   hopefully not with these people,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.920]   but much rather die trying to save others
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.080]   and to do well in that than to quit.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.920]   - Yeah.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.640]   - Yeah, that's a powerful thing
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.120]   that you just shine light on.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.560]   I don't think of the hundreds of interviews
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.120]   with team guys, ex team guys, buds, instructors, et cetera,
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:32.960]   that are out there.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.080]   I don't think anyone's ever highlighted that.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.040]   - I don't think I was aware of it then, Andrew,
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.680]   but I just, again, it's in retrospect.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.520]   - Well, the retrospect is in large part
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   what we're here for.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.000]   To go a little deeper on that,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.400]   I think that a lot of people have challenging homes.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.920]   The parents aren't necessarily divorced.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.560]   And we're talking, of course,
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   about trying to understand the human spirit,
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.680]   certainly not accomplishments per se,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.880]   but the human spirit.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.720]   So I think that a lot of people, especially nowadays,
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.800]   they look to their home life.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.040]   And if, God willing, they had a great home life,
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.440]   that is the basis.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.240]   It's the touchstone for them that they can return to.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.200]   But for a lot of people,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.320]   even people who go home for the holidays
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.680]   or who touch in with their parents,
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.920]   whether or not they're divorced or not,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.880]   that they don't feel like that family unit
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.720]   is really a solid thing.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.880]   Maybe they're in a place, I see this a lot,
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.000]   where they're the parent.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.080]   They had to grow up taking care of the parents.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.440]   I see that a lot on both the male side and the female side.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.280]   I see that.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.800]   So you're saying that one strong predictor
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.040]   of getting through is a feeling of people want,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.880]   essentially making it their almost biological identity
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   to get through.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.120]   - It was certainly the case for me.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.160]   I mean, when I got, again,
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.680]   I don't really like to overdo these things
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.440]   because it tends to feed the mythos a little.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.040]   But when I got to Bud's, Andrew,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.160]   when I got to the Naval Academy,
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.560]   I had a very strong sense of this is my chance.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.200]   And you develop over the years
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.080]   and you spend time thinking about this and having mentors.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.040]   When I got there, that was very much my first time of,
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:19.160]   you better bring the nastiest shit on the planet
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.440]   because I'm not leaving here.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.200]   Like, it's just not, I'm just not going.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.320]   And there's a Navy bit to it too.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.520]   Like, I didn't want to do anything else in the Navy.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.280]   So back to fear, I was afraid I would get stuck
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.160]   doing a job I didn't like.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.720]   But there's some, people are not wrong about Bud's.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.680]   There's some very difficult days
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.440]   where you do start to wonder, like, is this really worth it?
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.280]   And I never once thought about quitting.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.200]   It never crossed my mind because I just had
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.280]   these other things that I really had to do
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.640]   for myself and my life,
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.600]   or else I felt like I was going to have nothing.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.320]   And so, again, I don't think operating out of fear
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.520]   is particularly adaptive, but sometimes it,
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.760]   you know, the bit in your teeth is useful.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.440]   - Yeah, certainly in my own life,
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.560]   I could say, you know, getting real scared about being 19
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.360]   and essentially realizing I'm not good at anything.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.280]   I'm not good at anything.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.800]   And I was terrible at a lot of things.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.200]   And some of those things were taking me down
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.120]   a dangerous path.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.160]   That was the fear, I'm grateful for the fear piece.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.880]   It would, it scruffed me.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.680]   And let's talk about the suspended in school.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.520]   - Yep.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.480]   - First of all, that implies getting caught.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.000]   - Yes.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.160]   - Not just misbehaving, but getting caught.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.080]   Yeah, what do you think that's about?
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.120]   So we're really talking about a sense of rebellion
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.360]   against authority or the system
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.240]   that one finds themselves in.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.200]   - Which is super important for our line of work.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.840]   Like for me, again, I can only speak for myself.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.120]   For me, it was the wild fuck you factor.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.560]   Like you have to,
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.720]   there's just a nasty reality of the work we had to do.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.840]   You know, I was in from '98 until 2011.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.680]   - In the SEAL teams.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.480]   - In the SEAL teams from '98 until 2011.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.320]   Everybody knows what was happening between 9/11 and then.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.280]   It's not that it didn't stop happening.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.080]   I know, you know, from my own experience,
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   from '03 through 2010 was extremely intense.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:29.240]   Obviously the military has rules and we need rules
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.360]   and you follow the laws of armed conflict
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.720]   and you follow the rules of engagement.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.360]   There's no question about that ever.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.520]   But the shit that happens to you out in the field for real
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.200]   does not follow any pattern.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.080]   And so if you are a complete, you know,
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.720]   non-suspended from school rule follower,
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.000]   I'm not saying you won't be successful.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   I'm sure plenty of people are.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   But in our line of work, if you ask people,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.840]   most of them had a weird streak as they were coming up.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.640]   Like they have a little bit of a side eye
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.080]   when somebody tells them this is how stuff is.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.120]   Like, hmm, maybe it's like that, but you don't know that.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.400]   And where it really became clear for me, Andrew,
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.040]   was like at every stage in your development,
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.160]   you're still looking for what right looks like.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.840]   And when I was a, I'm now a Naval Academy graduate,
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.840]   not that that means anything special, but I'm smart enough.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.040]   I'm now in my twenties, I'm at BUD/S
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.160]   and I have this recollection later,
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.000]   like people are always telling stories about the teams.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.160]   And when you're a new student at BUD/S,
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.840]   you kind of believe everything the instructors tell you
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.880]   because it's pretty impressive shit.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.320]   And then you find out later when you,
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.240]   when I checked into SEAL Team 3,
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.680]   you actually start to understand the arc of the job.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.440]   It's like, all these guys were telling training stories.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.880]   Those weren't real combat stories.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.960]   Those, they never said that that was a story from training.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.320]   And so my point is like,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.360]   what you hope guys are getting it now,
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.920]   but what we didn't get a lot of
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.800]   was the real story in a sense.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.160]   Meaning, I will say definitively,
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.680]   my first combat deployment was '03 when we invaded Iraq.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.160]   I was a platoon commander when we invaded Iraq.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.280]   And I remember within a week of being in that situation,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.440]   thinking not one single instructor had the experience
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.560]   to mentor and coach me on this, not one.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.560]   And so you have to go back to that wild,
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.880]   suspended, fuck you factor mindset.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.320]   Like all your silly rules about how the military works,
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.040]   none of that shit's happening out here.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.080]   Like all this other stuff is happening
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.200]   that doesn't have anything to do with your training manuals
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.320]   except for the things you don't violate,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.400]   which is to your best of your ability, stuff happens,
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.080]   but the rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict,
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.000]   everything else is a toss up.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.680]   The tactics aren't, that's not a toss up,
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.520]   but you know what I mean?
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.280]   Like the environment is completely chaotic.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.760]   - It's a new sport.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.800]   - It's a brand new sport that no one coached you on.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.240]   - And it's high risk, high consequence
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.080]   for you and your teammates, but also for the other side.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.040]   - I mean, every 15 seconds is a new consequential decision.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.680]   - Yeah, 'cause you obviously don't want to kill civilians
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.040]   on the other side either.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:27.880]   - Of course not.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   - So you obviously get through buds.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.240]   You probably weren't surprised given your mindset,
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.080]   probably weren't surprised.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.560]   - No, I wasn't surprised.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.320]   At this point, I'm maybe building a little self-confidence
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.680]   and just operate out of fear.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.720]   - But happy, presumably.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.640]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.880]   - And I feel obligated to ask,
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.240]   well, I'm just curious to ask that you've been in a system
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.480]   of military for a long time.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.560]   Is there a bigger pull of patriotism there
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.280]   or that's just, it's there,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.680]   but I mean, are you thinking about country
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.400]   or are you thinking about team?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.760]   You think about the day.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.000]   - Yeah, I mean, at this point,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.320]   I'm fully indoctrinated in a sense.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.680]   The Naval Academy really does give you a sense of,
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.800]   again, bigness and you meet people from World War II
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.560]   and Vietnam and an amazing guy,
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.560]   which we can cover later.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.160]   I wasn't around when he was coming up,
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.520]   but Colonel John Ripley is a guy
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.880]   who won the Navy Cross in Vietnam.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.080]   The book, "The Bridge at Dong Ha" is about him.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.720]   He knew my, this is back to my uncle, Jim,
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.640]   who introduced, he and my uncle Jim were buddies
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.000]   and I met him, he's since passed away.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.480]   I met Colonel Ripley when I was a plebe
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.080]   at the Naval Academy.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   I work with one of his sons now, friend, teammate, mentor.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.160]   He's a great guy.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.240]   Colonel Ripley, he's a legend.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.640]   Like this guy's a Navy Cross winner,
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.120]   should've won the Congressional Medal of Honor
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.800]   by all accounts.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.720]   If you read the book, "The Bridge at Dong Ha,"
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.240]   you are gonna have no ability to understand
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.880]   why he's not dead.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.360]   And these are the kind of people you meet.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.440]   So back to the patriotism thing,
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.280]   by the time I was in the teams,
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.960]   I knew where I was sort of in this ecosystem.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.480]   Admittedly though, what I didn't really have, Andrew,
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.200]   because it, I mean, I love the country, of course,
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.360]   but it wasn't, again, I didn't grow up with a dad
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.120]   who was like, this was always in our house
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.360]   or it just wasn't that big of a thing.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.120]   This came for me after 9/11, obviously.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.000]   But yes, the patriotism and the importance of the jobs there
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.840]   but when I remember checking into SEAL Team 3,
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.440]   what emerged very quickly for me
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.600]   because we had Vietnam vets in the training cell
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.960]   at SEAL Team 3 and just some amazing people,
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.720]   what I realized right away was,
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.200]   okay, playtime is completely over.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.280]   And that was very useful, like early lesson,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.360]   not that anyone was fucking around in buds,
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.880]   like you know it's serious,
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.760]   but you meet a guy like Master Chief Martin
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.520]   who's got a hundred combat missions from Vietnam,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.920]   he's about to retire.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.560]   He was like the third person I met
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.680]   when I checked into the team
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.480]   and you suddenly are like a kid again
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.600]   where there's just no fucking around.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:26.080]   - So you're in the teams, presumably liking the work.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.360]   - Loved it.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.040]   - Loving the team component.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.000]   It's hard, it's unpredictable
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   and that's part of the fun.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.520]   - It's amazing, yeah.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.480]   The job's amazing.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.680]   - You do a number of different deployments
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.000]   and at some point you get called to try out
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   for the Tier 1 division within the SEAL Teams.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.480]   Maybe just explain a little bit of what Tier 1 means
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.840]   and we don't wanna speak in code here
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.680]   but we just gotta inform people
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.800]   that there are levels within the teams
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.160]   and that, yeah, tell us what Tier 1 is.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.880]   - Yeah, well, I'll just refer to it,
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.640]   Special Mission Unit, it's probably the easiest.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.200]   We have a bunch of teams on the East and West Coast
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.640]   as a lot of people know nowadays,
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.840]   this shit was not public knowledge years ago.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.280]   - Yeah, so you've got these different units
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.160]   within the SEAL Teams.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.960]   - Yeah, so you have to raise your hand.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.240]   You know, I was 10 years in, Andrew,
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.320]   I had been platoon commander during the invasion of Iraq.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.640]   We came to Monterey, I went to school,
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.840]   I went back to be a budget instructor.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.280]   It was 10 years, I felt like it was time to take my shot.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.080]   It's a little risky because it's hard to make it through,
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.280]   you know, Green Team and stuff at the Special Mission Unit.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.160]   It's a nine-month advanced training program.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.840]   You're 10 years into your career, you're not 22 anymore.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.560]   - And not everyone gets called to Green Team.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.400]   Not everyone can go.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.520]   You can't say, "I wanna go, I wanna try out."
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.920]   - You can say you wanna try out
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.680]   and you do a pre-screener.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.520]   So the command training staff,
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.680]   I'll call it the command for purposes of this conversation
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.800]   'cause I'm familiar with that term for us.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.440]   The command training staff comes out,
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.800]   they put you through all this stuff.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.200]   Some of it's psychological, some of it's physiological.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.480]   I don't think we did a blood test, but they checked.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.120]   The trainers checked everything on me,
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.600]   which I thought, this is actually a description
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.000]   of why the unit's Tier 1.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.760]   I was, even in the pre-screening,
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.920]   it was the first time, the way I joke about it
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.440]   is like I really felt like I was doing
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.160]   what was in the brochure.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.280]   Like it was real varsity stuff.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.720]   - I'm presaging a later conversation that we'll get to,
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.320]   but at this point, have you ever sat down
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.200]   with a psychologist and done a therapy session?
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.040]   - That was no therapy, but I sat down with a psychologist
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.400]   'cause they put us through the battery,
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.760]   the Neo-PIR, the RAVEN, stuff like that.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.120]   - They're asking you, how do you sleep at night?
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   How do you feel? - All of it, yeah.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.240]   - What do you dream about?
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.080]   - How much do you drink?
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.200]   And you say, "Two beers a week," and--
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.560]   - And you're lying at that point.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.440]   - I was lying. - Yeah.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.760]   But now it might be two beers a week.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.520]   Now it's zero. - Zero, right.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.080]   - But yeah, so it was good screening process.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.280]   I was like, oh shit, these guys are not messing around.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.440]   This is exactly what I wanted to do.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.060]   And the physical tests ramp up,
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.320]   and coincidentally, I worked for him later,
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.820]   still friends with him now.
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.000]   On my interview board was Britt Slabinski,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.560]   who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.320]   Britt was on my interview board, and he's a great guy.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.200]   And so yeah, then you just wait.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.400]   And if you get picked up, you go out to the East Coast,
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.480]   and you're really rolling the dice,
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.240]   because I was on the West Coast.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.800]   You move your whole family, sell your house,
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.720]   you may not have to sell your house, but we did.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.120]   And you move, and you're gonna do
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:34.280]   a nine-month advanced training program at the command
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.240]   just to get into a tactical unit,
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.560]   which we call squadrons.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.840]   And the best way, tactically,
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.200]   for me to describe the difference,
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.240]   and look, my time at Team 3 was amazing.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.600]   I'm not diminishing it.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.120]   But let me just use free fall, military free fall,
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.480]   for anybody who's even done civilian free fall.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.520]   - It's jumping airplanes. - Jumping.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.400]   So if we go to the drop zone, and we go jumping,
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.640]   FAA regulations have you jump at 12,999 feet,
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.400]   'cause as soon as you go above 13,000,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.800]   you have to use supplemental oxygen,
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.720]   which is not a huge deal,
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.240]   but it's a pain in the ass for the airplane to have it.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.640]   And so 99% of all your jumps,
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.560]   well, at any standard drop zone,
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.780]   your civilian jumps are gonna be below 13 grand.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:19.400]   For all of our jumping at SEAL Team 3 is below 13 grand.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.200]   It just makes the training more efficient.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.920]   And you'll jump during the daytime,
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.520]   maybe a little night jumping.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.720]   You'll probably have some lights for safety.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.060]   And if you look out of the airplane,
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.200]   you would be able to see the orange T on the drop zone.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.000]   All right, that's your standard jump profile.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.240]   Maybe you'll jump with some weight.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.520]   You'll certainly jump with your weapon,
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.600]   probably your helmet, but not all your jumps,
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.760]   'cause you're bringing guys from zero
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.060]   to be able to do tactical military free fall as a group.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:51.760]   When you go to the command,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   your jumps are from 25,000 feet.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.300]   You do 30 minutes of pre-breathing on oxygen,
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.200]   helmet, night vision, zero lights,
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.960]   an attack board that has your navigation system on it,
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:09.100]   100 pounds of gear, your weapon, your oxygen,
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.700]   all your shit, and 45 dudes piled up in a C-17.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.760]   And you drop miles away from the drop zone
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.320]   because your over ground speed at 25,000 feet
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   is hauling ass because of the wind.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.560]   And if you take your hands out of your gloves
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.480]   at 25,000 feet, it's curtains.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.080]   Like you're not gonna be able to use your fingers
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.080]   'cause it's so cold.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.840]   And you jump from way away, obviously,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.400]   and all your jump is completely blacked out.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.520]   Everybody turns IR lights on,
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.360]   their helmets and their infrared lights
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.160]   so you can see through night vision.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.840]   And you gotta fly that canopy multiple, multiple miles
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.840]   and land everybody on a drop zone.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.920]   That's, if you take every tactical thing we do
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.500]   and expand the same way you would expand free fall,
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.240]   that's the difference at the command.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.180]   Which is, look, I was, I wanna own this.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.040]   When I was at team three, because you think about this,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.140]   I had many, many moments where I was thinking,
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:08.040]   oh, fuck it, man, those guys aren't that much different.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   Like we're super high end, right?
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.220]   And we are.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.880]   And then when I got there, I was like,
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.440]   this is another level.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.360]   - What percentage of people that go to green team
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.600]   get through and get sort of--
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.860]   - I think I had 65 in my class.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.040]   You don't drop that many.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.720]   Maybe 10 guys didn't make it or something, maybe 15-ish.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.360]   - So then you were, why do they call it tier one?
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.780]   - No idea.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.720]   It must have some official reason.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.240]   'Cause if you go into like real documentation,
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.480]   Andrew, like there's echelons in,
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.120]   this command is echelon this,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.480]   this command is echelon this.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.020]   In the military, Congress sets end strength numbers.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.680]   It says the Navy, you get, at the one time,
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.920]   'cause it took some class,
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.040]   the Navy had like 355,000 people.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.600]   And that's the Navy's end strength.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.880]   And they have to distribute those numbers
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.280]   across everybody in the Navy.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.120]   So I don't know why it's called tier one,
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   but I think it has a reason.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.060]   - So you got through, you were accepted,
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.840]   and then you're doing very different sorts of things
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.000]   than you were doing previously.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.960]   - Very.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.400]   - So my understanding is
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.300]   this is largely counter-terrorist work.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:29.760]   So all the work in the military and SEAL teams
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.700]   is high risk, high consequence,
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.700]   but now it's special operations, as the name implies,
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.080]   where things have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.400]   It's highly unusual.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.320]   It was unusual before,
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.500]   but now it's highly unusual circumstances.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.960]   What was it like to be there?
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.400]   Did you like that family?
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.240]   - I loved it.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.640]   It was the best place to work.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:02.120]   - And this is 2000?
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.160]   - This is '06 through 2011 for me.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.400]   - Okay, so it's post 9/11 through 2011.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.640]   - Yep. - Okay.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.720]   So I'm sure a lot happened,
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.920]   and most of which we can't and won't discuss,
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.680]   and that's not what's important here,
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.640]   but clearly you met and worked
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.160]   with some amazing individuals.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.140]   I happen to know, because we've spoken before,
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:32.400]   and we have some common friends in that arena,
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.880]   that you had both the privilege of doing this work
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.860]   in this really important wartime,
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   but also the unfortunate experience of being close to
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.460]   and working with quite a lot of people that were killed.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.300]   - Yep.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.600]   - How many?
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.200]   - So, I mean, I don't know why I did this
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.560]   or why anyone does it.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.220]   It's way over 40,
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:01.200]   but I try not to over-affiliate myself
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.340]   with a larger group than I actually knew.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.680]   But the people that I personally knew, Andrew,
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.060]   it's exactly 40.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:12.560]   - And we could spend probably weeks
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   detailing how impressive each and every one of those people
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.580]   was in their individual cases.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.820]   This is perhaps an opportunity to put a call out.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.980]   There's a wonderful book, I think an important book,
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.020]   that isn't so well-known in the array
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.460]   of quote-unquote military and SEAL books,
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:36.780]   which is the book about Adam Brown, a fearless book.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.800]   I heard they're gonna make it into a movie.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.620]   But what I like about the book
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.300]   is actually has very little to do with the SEAL team.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:45.640]   - Totally, that's the best thing.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   - Is that Adam had a serious, serious problem with addiction
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.420]   that he masked at times,
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.980]   and it came back to pull him under various times
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.140]   while he was in the teams.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:59.900]   And I know you worked with Adam and you're close.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:00.940]   - He was on my green team, yeah.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.760]   - Yeah, so that's a great book
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.620]   for anyone that wants a different sort of book.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.420]   It's really about addiction and family
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.820]   and his discovery of the path out of all that.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.460]   - His tenacity is incredible.
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.760]   - It was an awesome, awesome book.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.420]   Human, about an awesome, awesome human.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.040]   So you do those years.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:29.100]   And then what happens when 40 people close to you die?
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.340]   I have to imagine involves that
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.360]   you get pretty good, unfortunately,
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:42.360]   at taking what each and every one of those is a tragedy
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.020]   and just continuing.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:48.900]   So let's just talk about that for a bit, if you're willing.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.380]   So guys are getting shot and blown up
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.180]   and you're close with them to say the least.
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:00.420]   And what was your role in the aftermath?
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.900]   Like, what do you do?
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:07.700]   You go to a funeral, you toast a few beers,
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.260]   and then you go back to work?
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.160]   - I mean, that's kind of,
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.620]   in the most simplistic terms, Andrew,
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.360]   that is exactly what happens.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:24.500]   There's obviously a lot more that goes on,
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.580]   but if you script the diary, so to speak,
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.160]   it wasn't a funeral every three months,
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.880]   but on average, if I average it out,
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:39.880]   'cause I've done this in excavating the last few years,
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.240]   we were at a funeral or memorial effectively every 90 days
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.800]   and in that time period.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:53.240]   But it wasn't obviously that simple.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.820]   Like for me and our family,
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.160]   Doug was my first super close teammate killed
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.240]   and it wasn't in the teams, right?
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.740]   I'm now at the command.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.400]   I was back from Afghanistan, from Kandahar.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.160]   This is way before the Marines built up
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.760]   a hundred kilometers west of Kandahar.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   We were operating six of us with like 180 Afghans,
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.560]   kind of the wild west back then.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.880]   And Doug was killed that summer of '07.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.520]   And I got a phone call from a friend.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.840]   I was standing in my kitchen in Virginia Beach
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.760]   and it was like,
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:38.240]   like the whole scaffolding of the world was just gone.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:43.640]   Because at that age, and here I am, like I'm some kid.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.080]   I was in my thirties, but I'm thinking,
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:51.840]   you know, things get more and more serious as you go,
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.120]   like at that time.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.440]   But when Doug was killed
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.840]   and I was a pallbearer in his funeral.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.720]   And, you know, we came up to Annapolis.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.640]   He was living in Annapolis 'cause he was working.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.560]   It's now been publicly released, which is nice for Pam
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.880]   because she can talk about it more.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.320]   He was working at the agency.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:13.400]   And when after his funeral and just the days around that,
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.520]   and then I go back to work.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.600]   And what I mentioned earlier about Doug
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.200]   and what I knew about him just as an operator,
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.920]   he had been a company commander in Fallujah.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.000]   He was on the front page of the LA Times.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.640]   Like Tony Perry is a reporter in San Diego.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.600]   He was in Fallujah following Doug.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:33.720]   The guy was, and Doug is not like a public people.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.120]   People were just attracted to him to tell his story.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   I have so many stories that I heard later from his bosses,
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.280]   his regimental commander, you know,
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.880]   told stories about his unit in Fallujah,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.000]   his Sergeant Major and his amazing guy.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.240]   I've talked to him about like what went on in Fallujah.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.760]   Doug's just a fucking legend.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.080]   I mean, he was awesome.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.640]   And the dominant thought after his funeral was,
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.600]   if things, it's not that you don't think they're serious.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.440]   And I mean, just about life, Andrew.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.880]   It wasn't just about combat action and hard deployments.
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:08.360]   It was about if Doug can be killed,
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.840]   all fucking bets are off.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.920]   They're all off.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.240]   Like if I didn't respect the rules before
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.400]   and didn't think society was particularly ordered
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.000]   in a way that I respected, you know,
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.560]   shit that I think is made up.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.560]   I knew when Doug was killed that it's all fucking made up.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.560]   Like he was supposed to be the immortal one.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:36.000]   And if he's not, none of us are.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.400]   Like everything has to be reevaluated.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.240]   You know, how old was I?
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.560]   I was 32.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.720]   - And you've got kids at this point.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.160]   - Mm-hmm, yeah, yep.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.360]   Yeah, Ollie wasn't born yet, my youngest.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.040]   - 'Cause you now have three boys.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.680]   - Yep, three boys, 21, 18, and 14.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.320]   And the older two were born.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.080]   My middle son was two at the time.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.200]   - And did it occur to you at the point when Doug was killed
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.560]   or maybe some other point that, you know,
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.000]   at some point you could die?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.600]   - Oh, I mean, that's what I mean, Andrew.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:12.880]   Like I, you know, personal work and therapy afterwards,
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.240]   it was then that I started looking over my shoulder,
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.280]   just in general.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.840]   Like everything was suddenly,
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:24.760]   like has to be watched with a vigilant eye.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.480]   - Something that close friends,
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.600]   close male friends of mine have told me,
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.440]   these are friends that are married with kids.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.760]   And I've heard this from people that were in the military
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.240]   and as well as those that weren't,
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.360]   was that it was very important to them
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   to marry somebody who, were they to die,
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.440]   they knew their kids would be well taken care of.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.000]   - Oh, that one's not even, there's no question about that.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   - Yeah, so that was like a primary criteria.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.520]   And I think in your line of work, I mean,
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.240]   that must be especially important
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:04.920]   because the probability of dying is,
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.560]   well, let's face it, is much higher.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.160]   As my sister who doesn't like sharks once told me,
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.760]   she said, you know, the best way to not get eaten by a shark
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.080]   is never go in the ocean.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.560]   You know, there is a way to limiting probabilities.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.480]   She'll swim in the ocean a little bit,
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.480]   but the point being that when you're in the military
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:23.120]   and your shoot, move and communicate
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.280]   is a big part of the job description.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.560]   And the enemy is also taught to shoot, move and communicate
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.640]   that there's a decent probability that you could die.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.640]   So did you ever think, okay, well, if I die,
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.680]   my kids are okay because Bridget's solid,
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:44.560]   or were you still just operating on this 24 hour schedule
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.680]   that you had adopted way back in the seventh grade?
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.840]   - No, I think, well, maybe,
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.560]   I'd have to ask her that question.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.480]   I think I was backed away
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.740]   from the 24 hour ledge a little bit.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:02.080]   I knew that the boys obviously would be taken care of
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.600]   with my wife, like that was never,
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.000]   and never crossed my mind probably
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.040]   until you just asked the question.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.000]   That was almost just like table stakes.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.620]   Back to this adaptive but maladaptive behavior.
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:17.240]   When Doug was killed,
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.640]   I just realized I had to work even harder
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.960]   to try to stay alive.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.360]   'Cause if you met the guy, there is,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.640]   I'm gonna say it probably multiple,
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.440]   there is not a fucking human on the planet
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:36.440]   that was as tough and as focused and as hyper dialed in
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.680]   to how to do the job 100% effectively as he was.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:49.480]   And it happened to him.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.680]   It's almost embarrassing, Andrew,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.080]   to say I never thought about it like that
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.240]   until Doug was killed.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.320]   - And yet, and I'm not challenging that at all, of course,
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.360]   I mean, life, circumstances,
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.360]   the other team gets a vote too.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.200]   - Totally.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.600]   - I mean, somebody can be seemingly indestructible,
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.680]   oh so capable and talented,
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.560]   and get T-boned in an intersection and die.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.960]   Right, like that.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.600]   We've known people like that.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.240]   All of us, you hear these things,
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.920]   that's why they're called tragedies.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.080]   - Yeah, we just, like to put it in context,
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.560]   we have to remember is part of the beauty
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.560]   of taking a young person
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.940]   and taking all the ingredients
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:34.020]   that a person comes into special operations,
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.480]   pick your service, I'm not, I'm agnostic.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.360]   I mean, some of my best buddies are Army and Marine Corps,
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.520]   like I'm agnostic to the service head,
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.560]   is when you end up at a certain point,
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.360]   like and you look back, you realize for 10 or 15 years,
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.720]   I've been indoctrinated in a very adaptive way
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.220]   to believe that I'm immortal.
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:57.400]   Because if you didn't,
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.480]   you certainly wouldn't jump out of aircraft
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.280]   at 25,000 feet with no lights,
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.680]   and you for hell for sure wouldn't go
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.000]   into some of these fucking towns we go into
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.080]   and end up in these firefights.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.760]   Like you have some weird, I'll speak for myself,
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:13.320]   I was entirely convinced that I couldn't be killed.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.840]   And I, just because I was in some way, Andrew,
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.080]   convinced that our training was so good,
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:25.280]   that that shit wouldn't happen to us.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.080]   - Let's take a step back for a second
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.320]   and acknowledge the truth all around
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.080]   that set of statements,
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.480]   which is that I think most people can think
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.320]   of the government and the training programs
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.120]   as honing the body,
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.760]   but it's probably not lost on you
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.320]   at this point in your life, that you were, you're a weapon.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.240]   Your mind became a weapon, right?
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.680]   Your body became a weapon.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:57.060]   You were a weapon of the military from the inside out.
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.720]   And in the statement you just made encapsulates that.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:05.200]   And that weapon honed itself for a long time,
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.320]   but then that's what the military is.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.600]   It creates weapons out of humans.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.800]   And I'm not demonizing the military whatsoever.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.960]   I wanna be very clear.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.880]   I realized that statement could be construed differently,
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.960]   but that mindset encapsulates that.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.400]   So-
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.280]   - So with the other guys,
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.880]   I wanna make sure I finish your question.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.000]   So it started with Doug and then, you know,
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.960]   I don't know what direction you wanna go here specifically,
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.760]   but then it just kept going, Andrew, right?
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.040]   Like at that time, Doug was '07,
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.720]   and then we went to Iraq in the winter of '07, '08,
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.000]   which was complete mayhem.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.400]   And the troop was,
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.680]   I mean, my troop in the winter of '07, '08
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.480]   were like fucking superheroes.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:52.520]   And a guy named Tommy Valentine was the troop chief.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.600]   And we got home and he was killed in a parachute accident.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.540]   After all that shit we went through.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:00.520]   Badger, a guy named Mark Carter
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.420]   was killed in that deployment.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.040]   We got home and Tommy was killed in a parachute accident.
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.960]   And me and a guy named Dutch,
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.440]   we went up to Minnesota to notify Tommy's parents
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.120]   and his sister and his brother.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.000]   And we're not, the Navy calls them CACOs,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.640]   like casualty assistance officers.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.260]   These are jobs in the military
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:21.720]   where you're trained to do this stuff.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.360]   You know, one of the things that's amazing about us
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.040]   is if a guy gets killed, we send a team guy there.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.400]   But think about the team guy.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.400]   Like it's great for the family that you send the team guy,
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.100]   but we don't know shit about sitting with a family
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.240]   who's about to be notified that their son,
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.820]   in this case of Tommy, was killed.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.820]   Britt went to Christina's house.
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.820]   Slab, Britt Slabinski.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:43.940]   He went to Christina's house
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.220]   and me and Dutch went up to Minnesota.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:50.460]   And I'm shaking right now.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.500]   Like I was shaking the whole drive.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.900]   We had to get to International Falls all the way up north.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.060]   The Valentines are incredible people.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   And I mean, notifying a family was just, it was brutal.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.900]   And so this is '08, and then it just keeps coming.
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:13.380]   It's Nate and it's Mike and it's Lance
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.320]   and it's extortion in 2011.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.140]   And in the middle of that, Adam gets killed, right?
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.620]   Like tons of people know about extortion
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.360]   'cause it was one helicopter, obviously four.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.340]   - Well, maybe we just briefly want to mention
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.420]   that was August 2011, as I recall.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.420]   - Yes, yeah, August of '11, yeah.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.780]   But in 2010, Adam is killed.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:41.660]   And I got a phone call and I wasn't best friends.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:44.180]   I mean, Adam had some very close friends as a command
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.540]   that I don't want to make anybody give the impression
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.780]   that like me and Adam were boys.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.860]   We knew each other well, right?
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:50.740]   We went through green team together.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.800]   He was in a different squadron though,
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.740]   so you sort of get separated a little.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:58.060]   And I got a phone call in the middle of the night
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.620]   from one of my buddies who's still in,
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.060]   who is another legend.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:06.260]   And I answered the phone and it's midnight.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.760]   I knew something was wrong.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.860]   And we were kind of in this pattern then,
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:13.260]   and you're like, actually a few of the commands were,
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:15.100]   like our partner command and a bunch of other guys
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.180]   we work with in other units.
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.580]   It was a hard time, like guys were fighting hard overseas.
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.100]   And that just comes with the consequences we know,
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.580]   you know, and I get the phone call in the middle of night.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.420]   I'm like, phew.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:31.900]   And so this guy tells me, you know, get your uniform.
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.740]   You need to come in.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.100]   Something happened.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.460]   I'm like, I fucking know what happened.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.420]   Like, tell me who it is.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.340]   And they, you know, didn't want to say it over the phone,
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:39.180]   which I get.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:45.860]   And I had like one of those moments where I told him, no,
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:49.400]   I can't, I can't do that again.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.900]   Like you have to get somebody who knows
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.340]   what the fuck they're doing.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:56.140]   And he just didn't let me off the hook, you know,
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.620]   get your shit and come into the command
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.020]   'cause you got to do all this prep stuff.
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:04.440]   And I walked into the conference room.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.980]   I mean, I remember it clear as day.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.340]   And I walked into the conference room
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.740]   and I could see it on everybody's face.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.260]   Again, this is 2010 now.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:17.220]   They were more terrified than I was.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.260]   And these are, you know, civilian guys,
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:20.660]   guys who retired who are now civilians.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.160]   They work at the command and amazing people.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.260]   And they looked like,
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.620]   I don't know if you've seen Peter Jackson's remake,
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.420]   They Shall Not Grow Old.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.000]   Oh, you have to watch it.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.880]   They Shall Not Grow Old is,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.980]   Peter Jackson took real World War I footage.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:38.820]   - Oh, I did see that, yes.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.660]   - Yeah, and he put the color and the lip reading.
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:43.420]   And there's a scene,
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.760]   I don't know if it's a Battle of the Bulge or exactly,
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.980]   there's a scene where
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:52.940]   this young unit, army unit is about to go up
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.380]   over the top and, you know, run across an open field.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:44:00.380]   And the camera pans over and there's a young kid
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.540]   with his rifle in front of him,
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:05.680]   the bayonet affixed to it, his helmet on,
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.420]   his lips are sort of flat and pursed.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.380]   And he, everybody in that conference room looked like him.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:13.360]   When I saw that movie later,
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.720]   I'm like, every single person looked like him.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:16.820]   And they told me it was Adam
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.720]   and we were gonna go notify Kelly, his wife.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.860]   - And he had little ones at that point.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.860]   - Savannah and Nathan, yeah, they were small.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.660]   And we knocked on,
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:34.340]   she had a sort of a stained glass like window
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.860]   and I could see her at the top of the stairs.
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:44.820]   That was the worst, man.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.860]   It was the worst.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:54.580]   So we sat with Kelly and a bunch of other guys were there,
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.080]   of course, it wasn't just me and we did our best.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.540]   And I learned later and, you know,
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:05.220]   reading Paul's work, Dr. Conte and other people,
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:07.380]   and like, that was it, dude.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.540]   I was like a, I don't know if it's a locust
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.580]   or whatever that sheds their skin.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.140]   I literally like left a shell of myself
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.960]   on Kelly's front porch and walked out of my skin.
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.140]   It was, that was tough.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.700]   That was tough.
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:29.280]   And so that was kind of the tempo to answer your question.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.640]   Like it wasn't exactly every 90 days,
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.640]   but almost every 90 days from '06 to 2011 for me,
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.500]   I got out in the fall of 2011,
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.660]   it was Memorial at the Theater,
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:45.100]   Memorial at the People's House, you know.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.780]   And our neighbor across the street in Virginia Beach,
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.020]   she lost her husband in '07.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.180]   So one house over, so she was best friends with us,
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:55.960]   you know, and so you are trying to live two lives.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:02.020]   You have this military life with all these consequences
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:06.460]   where every bone in your body
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:09.900]   is telling you to go full Spartan.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:12.100]   Like, no, not that the Spartans didn't have families
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.820]   'cause they did, whatever, nothing else.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:17.980]   Like just cut off every other thing in your life completely.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.700]   You have to go do this and you have to do it full on
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.420]   because clearly all bets are off.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.220]   Like we're barely making it through.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.380]   We're losing our best guys.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:31.780]   And how the fuck do I survive at this pace?
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:35.140]   And so, because we're all in the same community
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:37.620]   in Virginia Beach, you're around it all the time
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:39.500]   when you're home, you know, and you should be
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:42.060]   because you're supporting your teammates' families
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.780]   and that's important.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:47.060]   But it was just, it's almost like a dream, you know,
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.820]   when I think about it now, how do,
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:50.960]   how did we live like that?
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.580]   How does anyone live like that?
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.820]   And I know, you know, my experience as a military,
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:57.540]   people go through, you know, all sorts of tough situations
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.180]   and different walks of life,
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.020]   but I have so much compassion for anybody
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.540]   who's trying to live in an environment like that
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:08.400]   where, you know, you are going on the next deployment
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.980]   and you know, I mean, look, Andrew, we left Bakuban
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:13.540]   in '08 before Tommy was killed.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.240]   Three fucking weeks later, guys are getting blown up
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.140]   in the same area, like, and they got all the debrief from us.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.200]   They knew exactly where to go,
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.580]   but it was just such a kinetic environment.
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:29.820]   We just, it was almost like you couldn't stop it, you know?
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.340]   It was just like the ball's rolling.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:34.660]   And when I think about people overseas
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.260]   and, you know, different situations
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.520]   that countries find themselves in right now,
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:44.100]   I can feel it for them, you know, what they're,
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:44.940]   what it takes.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:48.440]   It's an intense environment.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:53.600]   - Yeah, certainly that comes through.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.520]   I think years ago, you said to me,
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:02.040]   and this will be an important way of setting aside
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.900]   which side people are on, you know,
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.760]   whether or not you side with one group
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.940]   in the Middle East or the other,
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.680]   or you feel for everybody that one of the things
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.860]   that you said that really rung in my ears for a long time
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.860]   is that the warriors on both sides in their own minds,
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:23.160]   each and all of them are just doing
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.720]   what they think is right for them and their families.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.680]   Like, you cannot erase that fact.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:30.800]   Like, whether or not the government of this country
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.200]   or the government of that country or group
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:33.360]   was correct or incorrect,
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.960]   whether or not you're even talking about a terrorist cell
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:38.600]   versus a military, a formal military group
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.780]   or special operations group,
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:41.940]   that in the minds of the warriors,
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.700]   they're doing what they truly believe
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.740]   is right for them and their families,
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.320]   and sometimes country as well.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.240]   And when I heard that, it was sort of a,
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.340]   you know, it's sort of an obvious statement on the one hand,
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.540]   but it's a very important one, I think,
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.680]   to the psychology that, you know,
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.980]   everyone's fighting tooth and nail
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.780]   because they believe that they are right,
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:05.940]   or they're just fighting tooth and nail for whatever reason.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.820]   And that was an important thing for me to hear.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.260]   And I think about that a lot when I see any news stories
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:14.280]   about international conflict or terrorist military conflict,
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.640]   terrorist civilian stuff, even, you know, people,
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.640]   there's something about the human brain.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.440]   People get this into their mind, like, this is my job,
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.280]   and they're doing it.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.720]   It doesn't justify it,
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.180]   but going back to this thing of being a weapon,
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.720]   humans can be trained as weapons,
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.260]   and it's often not the weapons themselves
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.960]   that are making the decisions about where to go
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.780]   and what to do.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:35.620]   Sometimes it is.
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.700]   - At this time, Coleman,
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.500]   what's going on with the three boys, with Bridget?
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.980]   I mean, your boys have turned out really well.
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.820]   - They're amazing.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:49.340]   - They're amazing.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.260]   And there's no coincidence there.
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.780]   And obviously it was a team effort with you and Bridget.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.380]   But, you know, there are a lot of things
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.380]   about the way the scenario you're describing here
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:02.600]   that speaks to like, how can a home function?
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.700]   But obviously it functioned well.
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:09.880]   And, you know, it's remarkable,
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.040]   but it can't be due to chance.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.280]   So were you able to compartmentalize,
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:16.040]   like, the moment you hit your front door,
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.360]   your dad at home, your husband,
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:23.000]   and was that a pause in a conversation with yourself
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:23.840]   at the front door,
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.840]   or that's just something that becomes reflexive?
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.800]   - I mean, I...
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:34.160]   I think it was just reflexive.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.740]   It wasn't really a pause at the front door.
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:40.100]   And admittedly, the story I would like to tell
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.180]   is that I was super Zen about it.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:46.380]   And I had this process and I would come home
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.120]   and I would take this off and put on regular dad things.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:54.120]   And I think I was just by the same level of effort
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.260]   that we put into what we were doing,
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:01.360]   Bridget and every other wife, mom,
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:04.920]   at least the ones that I knew,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.320]   they put that level effort in as well.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:14.320]   It made our home life just very comfortable.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.040]   So it was easy.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:18.080]   Like, I didn't have to go through some process, right?
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.600]   It was, this is how I remember it.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.320]   It was easy for me.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.840]   I don't know if it was easy for Bridget.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.060]   She would have to answer that question.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:25.320]   It was easy for me.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.720]   And so I felt like for the most part,
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:33.040]   like I wasn't like platoon commander dad, you know,
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:37.260]   some movie, you know, the great Santini type dad.
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:40.060]   You know, I think Pat Conroy wrote "The Great Santini."
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.160]   His dad was crazy, apparently,
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.680]   or it's like, that's what he writes about.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.800]   It wasn't like that.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.640]   It was more of this home is such a relief
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:52.980]   and Bridget is so dialed that I don't have to,
[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:54.860]   unfortunately, hard for Bridget,
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:56.920]   I don't have to do anything.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.340]   You know, the time that I'm here, I can be here
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.860]   and then, you know, go away again.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:06.600]   And so it's, as we know, what trauma does to the mind,
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.800]   like there are many, many stretches of that time period
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.320]   that I just don't remember.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.900]   And what I do remember is mostly,
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:22.100]   obviously the fun times, the front yard, the whatever,
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:25.300]   playing with the boys, doing rough housing
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.540]   and going on vacation and stuff.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.660]   But the, when I was in the grind,
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:30.580]   when we were in the training cycle of our cycle
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.180]   of deployment or whatever,
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:35.540]   I don't really remember sections of it.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:41.460]   - So a lot, far too many,
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:44.860]   I guess even one would be far too many doorbells,
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:45.900]   ringing on doorbells.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:49.260]   You decided to get out.
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:54.220]   Was that a conscious decision based on time,
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.280]   conscious decision based on like,
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.720]   I would like to have the rest of my life?
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:52:59.560]   You're done.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.780]   I don't like to call it a regret, you know,
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:04.300]   but it's just kind of emblematic of where I was.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:06.280]   It was the right decision.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.740]   I do not regret getting out at the 13 year mark,
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:09.700]   not for a second.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:12.640]   I needed it.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.080]   We needed it as a family.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.520]   It was a snap.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.740]   It was a snap decision.
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:20.700]   It was like a, what do we say?
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.540]   24 hour decision.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.500]   - A 24 hour horizon.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.420]   - I was standing on the ledge of the 24 hour horizon.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.260]   - Right.
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:29.340]   And you said, what year was that again?
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.260]   - That was the fall of 2011.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.100]   - 2011.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:32.920]   - Yeah.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.760]   - Okay, so that's about four or five years
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.600]   before you and I met.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.440]   - Yeah.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.260]   - Yeah, so extortion, we can just,
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.600]   we don't have to touch into it too deeply
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.520]   'cause people can look it up,
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.640]   but this was a massive loss of special operations,
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:43.960]   including a lot of SEALs.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:47.000]   It was basically a helicopter shot out of the sky
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.120]   with a rap, with a grenade, right?
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.080]   - Yeah, RPG.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:52.920]   - RPG.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.480]   People can look it up if they want to.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:58.880]   And there's a lot of material out there about it.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.260]   And it's just, can only be described as a tragedy.
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:04.140]   So, and I'm not trying to make light of it.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.660]   I just think that we could do,
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:08.460]   there's a lot to explore there in a different discussion.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:12.260]   In case you're out, now the probability
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:15.300]   that you're gonna die is much lower, provided.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:16.940]   - It's not in my nervous system, so.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:18.740]   - Right, but you're out.
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:22.980]   And what do you do?
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.500]   Meaning, what do you do with all that energy?
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   The energy of the way you've been operating up until now,
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:36.600]   these intense battle rhythms, vampire schedules,
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:37.580]   as you call them.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.600]   But also, what do you do with all the energy
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.120]   of what happened?
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.600]   You know, I think this is where I think our conversation
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.240]   really hopefully has been related to other people
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.080]   as we've been going.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:53.240]   But that, you know, sometimes I stop and I'm like,
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.920]   I know I'm supposed to process all this stuff, you know,
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.120]   that's happened.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.840]   But it's like, what do you do when so much has happened?
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.480]   Or when something's happened that,
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.680]   you know you have to move on from,
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.860]   you know you need to compartmentalize,
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:07.580]   but that lives in our nervous system.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:09.760]   So are you thinking about that?
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.760]   No, you're Coleman Ruiz at that point.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:14.240]   You're just going forward.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.400]   - It's just fucking crazy.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.040]   I mean, I just didn't know, you know.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.160]   It's 2011, it doesn't sound like that long ago,
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:26.160]   but still in 2011, this was not a topic for conversation.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:32.160]   You know, and I took maybe one week to process out.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:35.960]   I turned in my gear, I turned in my badge,
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.480]   and my next visit to the command years later,
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.660]   I had to be escorted on by people I worked with
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.120]   in the same fucking squadron.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.160]   Like, so within a matter of one week, I'm a stranger.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.000]   Like I can't get on the base.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.440]   There's reasons for that, I get that,
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.760]   but I'm just using it as a, I mean, to make the point.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.880]   - There was nothing dishonorable about how you went.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.720]   It's just that there's security reasons.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.500]   - You can't just drive on the base anymore, you know?
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:03.080]   And this is like emblematic of,
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:04.480]   of course I didn't talk to anybody about it,
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:07.120]   not even Bridget, but at the time,
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.360]   in those first, call it couple of years
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.280]   or even couple of months, I don't know.
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:15.560]   The question you just asked me is a question I was asked,
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.480]   like, what do I do?
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.840]   Like, not with work.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:21.720]   Like, what do I do, period, with life?
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.360]   Like, how do I manage my time?
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:24.680]   And I'm not some bumbling idiot.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.360]   It's not like I was walking around the neighborhood,
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.040]   like trying to figure out where my house was.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:33.760]   I had just been in that environment for so long,
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:38.760]   to your point, that I didn't know what to do.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.320]   I didn't know what to do with my thoughts, my feelings,
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.800]   my, you know, I could go to the Buddhist five aggregates,
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.200]   my thoughts, feelings, perceptions, physical form,
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.640]   like all these things I've learned about
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.440]   and thought about later that have helped so much,
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.320]   I didn't know what to do with any of it.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:55.600]   Like, I didn't know what to do with night sweats.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:56.940]   I didn't know what to do with,
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:00.320]   I thought the term PTSD was the biggest fucking joke
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.080]   on the planet until I read all the symptoms.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:05.040]   And I'm like, wait, wait a minute.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.040]   - It sounds familiar.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.920]   - And so it's that, and it was just like,
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.960]   and so I remember like even the little things
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.720]   that kind of make the point of the big things.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.920]   I didn't know how to get a dentist.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:19.880]   I could just go to the dentist in the military.
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.280]   You know, I thought when I was walking around the food line
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.640]   that somebody was gonna call me and say,
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.320]   "Come back to the base," because like the bubble went up.
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:32.320]   You just, I had zero context and didn't have the courage,
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.520]   or not even just the courage, but know who to ask.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.240]   Right, it wasn't the mentoring.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.360]   One of the most important books in my life
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:42.760]   in the last 12 years has been
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.400]   Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces"
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.940]   for the back end of the hero's journey.
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:48.780]   And--
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.600]   - I haven't read it.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.440]   I know I should.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:51.280]   I know I should.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.100]   - You should actually listen to it.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:52.940]   - I should listen to it.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:53.780]   It's better to,
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.000]   I've probably only listened to five audio books in my life.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.860]   I prefer to read in paper because I can take notes.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:02.040]   In the margin, that book is better listened to.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.360]   - "Hero with a Thousand Faces."
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.680]   - "The Hero with a Thousand Faces."
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:06.600]   - Could you just highlight a couple of the things
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:09.000]   that you took from the back end of that
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.080]   that somehow shifted your mind toward like, like cued you.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.400]   I'm thinking Coleman Rui's "Circuit 2011"
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.520]   is like, like, what do I do now?
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.680]   And then something cues you.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.440]   There's like a beacon someplace.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.640]   It's like, I always think of this like a texture
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:24.480]   of something and you're like,
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.380]   oh, I want to, you know, you want to feel it more
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.220]   to get a sense of what it is.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.600]   Is that about right?
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.200]   - It was in that case, for sure.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.520]   So Joseph Campbell wrote that book in 1949
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.440]   and "The Hero with a Thousand Faces"
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:39.040]   is effectively the 17 stage hero journey,
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.400]   which by the way, George Lucas says
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.440]   and has said many times publicly,
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:45.720]   he built the arc of "Star Wars"
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:47.680]   around the 17 stage hero's journey.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:51.160]   He credits Joseph Campbell's book for helping him.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:54.400]   And if you ever read it or you go through the 17 stages
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.720]   or you see it or watch a short video, anybody,
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.760]   you'll see how damn near everybody's life,
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.960]   which is why it's called the monomyth.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:04.120]   He describes it as the monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.960]   There's a little weirder term for it.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:11.080]   But what he lays out in the book is, I don't know,
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:14.200]   maybe supposedly 2000 years of culture
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.500]   across multiple cultures.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.840]   Book is incredibly complicated in that sense.
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:22.400]   Angie, when I, so I listened to it audio first
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.480]   and then went back to it and listened to it in paper.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.880]   I could not believe how a human
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:28.200]   could put this narrative together, honestly.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.680]   And so, but the summary,
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.400]   I struggled with the first 10 stages a little bit,
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.000]   but I'll try to come back to them.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.600]   If you look at the image, when you lay out the 17 stages,
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:44.680]   the way it's in a circle is the ordinary world
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.320]   and the extraordinary world is on the bottom of the page.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.760]   And there's a horizontal line,
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.080]   the diameter of that circle goes horizontally across
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.520]   and the extraordinary world's on the bottom,
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:54.280]   the ordinary world's on the top.
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.120]   Okay, and so let me talk about
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.280]   the back end of the journey first,
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.840]   'cause what I was mostly concerned about
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.440]   with when a friend pointed me to that book
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.840]   was my return to the ordinary world.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.760]   And he told me, "Coleman, you gotta read this book."
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.120]   And so the back end of the hero's journey
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:14.120]   in the return section is seven stages of the 17.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.840]   It's the ultimate boon,
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:22.280]   which is you learned something big in life.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.240]   It depended on, everybody learns something
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:27.880]   where you sort of realize that something big happened to me.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:28.880]   That's the ultimate boon.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.880]   And you have this incredible desire to do something with it.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.520]   It's either knowledge or it's experience or whatever.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.120]   And the ultimate boon you have
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.320]   and you feel like this life thing.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.960]   And then the next stage is typically refusal of the return.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.520]   You really don't wanna come back to the ordinary world
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:51.880]   'cause you feel that there is some level of consequence
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:54.120]   that maybe you can't handle
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:56.920]   or somebody won't understand, you know?
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.720]   - Or maybe it's too mundane, you'll be--
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.200]   - Maybe. - You'll feel adrift.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:03.280]   - Totally, yeah, and this is in the description
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.520]   of the stages, what you just described
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.920]   as part of that description.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.120]   The next stage, you're coming up back
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.840]   into the ordinary world and this return is magic flight.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.240]   And the way it's described in myths or in real life
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:22.320]   is you have to escape that extraordinary world
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:27.080]   and take one more dangerous flight or sneak away
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.440]   or something is catapulting you to take that ultimate boon
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:33.480]   and fight against that refusal.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.000]   You're taking magic flight.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.200]   - Amazing.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.400]   - And then there is, is it,
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:46.040]   it's assistance, I think.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.720]   Yeah, it's like assistance from a,
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:51.200]   like a special power or something,
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.040]   which could be your own or somebody else.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.360]   Right, and then suddenly you're into the last three,
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.320]   which is crossing the return threshold
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.320]   into the ordinary world, master of two worlds,
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:09.320]   where you finally realize, through help and/or process,
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:12.760]   where you can hold these two opposing life experiences
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.080]   in place.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.800]   And then the very last stage, 17, is freedom to live.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.280]   And when you can, I'm gonna give you
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.600]   my little pet theory in a second.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:25.760]   When you can work your way through those stages,
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.560]   you can have the freedom to live.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:32.480]   What I realized potentially happened to me,
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.320]   just my internal feelings about, you know,
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:37.920]   my coming out of the military and back,
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:42.920]   is if you skip or you don't figure out
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:46.080]   how to deal with the refusal to return,
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.600]   and you just pick, I'm gonna call it the next big thing,
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:54.000]   you catapult yourself into a new cycle,
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.920]   and you never finish.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:57.640]   And one of two things has happened.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.880]   You're either two people trapped in the ordinary world,
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:02.480]   or you're one person trapped in two worlds.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.520]   I don't know which it is.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:05.440]   Like it's either two worlds in one person,
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:07.440]   or it's two people trying to live in one world,
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.280]   but shit gets crazy, right?
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.880]   Because you just haven't done the cycle.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.960]   And it sounds very miscellaneous,
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.480]   but if you read "A Hero with a Thousand Faces,"
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480]   you're like, this journey is not new.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.000]   Like this is thousands of years
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.720]   of very typical human cycle.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.040]   Now, if we go back to the top of the circle,
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.960]   let me try to scream through the first 10,
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:29.280]   which will be very obvious for "Star Wars" fans.
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.960]   Just think about what Luke does.
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:33.400]   And I'm not like a super "Star Wars" person.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.400]   I've seen the movies, but it's a call to adventure.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.120]   Most of us have a call to adventure
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.760]   of some sort in our life.
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:41.200]   Refuse the call.
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.360]   Help from a mentor.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:45.160]   Crossing the first threshold.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.520]   The belly of the whale,
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.120]   which is described as when you first truly separate.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.680]   This was me leaving for college.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.200]   When you first truly separate from the ordinary world.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:57.440]   Road of trials.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.520]   Meeting the goddess.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:03.920]   Temptations.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.080]   Atonement with the father.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.480]   Apostasis, which is kind of like dying a death
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.600]   while you're still alive.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:12.760]   And then you're into those return stages.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.200]   And when I first read that book, Andrew,
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.120]   I was like, I'm trapped in the return.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:19.720]   I'm trapped somewhere in the return.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:23.040]   Just emotionally.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.000]   And one of the places
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.400]   that I was absolutely trapped in the return
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:31.640]   was I didn't have the mentor
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:34.120]   to help me cross the threshold.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:37.040]   I knew I had to move on in my life.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:41.280]   I knew I had learned something extremely valuable.
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:43.720]   I knew that there was a way through
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:45.960]   'cause people across thousands of years of humanity
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:46.800]   have done it.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.840]   I don't think I'm special.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.760]   And I never had the mentor.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:54.000]   I got mentors later, a couple of years out.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:00.000]   And it reminds me that in the,
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.400]   so I got out in the fall of 2011.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.960]   In the summer, one of my very good friends
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:06.480]   who lives in Connecticut, he works in New York.
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.480]   He brought me to a lunch at some fancy club in New York
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.120]   with a guy named Buddy Buca.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.240]   Paul "Buddy" Buca,
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.640]   who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:16.480]   He's a West Point grad.
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:18.160]   He won the CMH in Vietnam.
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:22.360]   I'd been around a lot of famous military people.
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.880]   Lunch was very normal, but Buddy was amazing.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:25.760]   It was a normal lunch.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.440]   We didn't talk about much, like impact.
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.800]   We didn't talk about combat action or whatever.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:33.600]   There was a green velvet set of stairs.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.640]   We were leaving the club, the upstairs.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.440]   We were coming down the green set of stairs.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.840]   If I remember, Buddy's a little bit shorter than I am.
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:42.560]   He reached out, I was on his left.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.920]   He reached out his left arm.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:46.720]   I was a stair, one stair below him.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.360]   He stopped me.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.800]   I turned to my right to look at him.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.800]   He looked at me.
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:52.200]   He said, "Son, you have it.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.360]   "You know that?
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.760]   "You have it, PTS.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.960]   "And you're gonna have to deal with it."
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.800]   And we left.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:05:59.640]   I got in a cab and I left.
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:04.400]   And I remember thinking, "You might have it, but I don't."
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:07.200]   Because that's the old days.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.560]   Like we were prepared for this shit.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:13.600]   I was still convinced that I'm good.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:15.320]   Like nothing happened to me.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.600]   Nothing in the military happened to me.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.760]   That's just normal stuff.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.880]   And all of our training, it's a story I told myself.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.960]   All of our training prepared me for that.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:25.880]   Like this, the rest of my life is just gonna,
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:29.840]   nothing bad's gonna happen because I'm good,
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.560]   whatever that meant.
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.240]   And when I started to learn more and read more
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:36.800]   and talk to people who were helping me,
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.720]   I remembered Buddy telling me that.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:42.160]   And back to those return stages, Andrew,
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.960]   it's just incredibly important for me
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.120]   to understand that my journey is not special.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.160]   We are part of a long history of evolution
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:53.800]   that people who go through very challenging.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.440]   I mean, the 17 stages in Joseph
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:00.080]   could not be more accurate to my life,
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:01.320]   particularly the return.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:05.680]   - And of course, if one looked from the outside,
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.960]   they would agree with your mindset then and say,
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.840]   "You're alive.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.760]   You certainly done very hard things, extraordinary things.
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:17.720]   You're married, you got three kids, they're thriving."
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:22.200]   PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder,
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.440]   and things like it.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.080]   'Cause I don't think any single acronym
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:27.600]   or diagnosis can capture anything.
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.480]   I think Paul Conti made that very clear to us
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.920]   in the mental health series.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:34.000]   These are names by necessity, but-
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:34.840]   - It's a framework.
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:36.520]   It certainly taught me something.
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:37.360]   - Absolutely.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.400]   And certainly those who haven't been in the military,
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:43.280]   maybe had a seed event of something challenging
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:44.800]   or whatever it is.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.920]   Many people struggle with these kinds of things
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:52.240]   that live inside them, in their nervous system.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.360]   They pack it down, maybe they don't,
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:58.280]   but that was inside you at that point.
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:00.000]   I think you and I first got acquainted
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.800]   in somewhere around 2016,
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:06.640]   when you and some other folks from tier one community
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.560]   and related communities started coming to the lab.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.720]   And my lab, and I never really talked publicly about,
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:14.040]   my lab has been involved with various things
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.960]   in Canada and the U.S.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:17.360]   Not trying to create any mystique there,
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:19.800]   but it's not a point of interest what we did.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.400]   But I recall at that time just thinking like,
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.000]   this guy's just an amazing team guy.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000]   But in any event, we got to know each other a bit.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.840]   And my sense then was like,
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:41.080]   it's kind of indestructible, right?
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:42.920]   And now I realize nobody's indestructible.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.520]   We're flesh and bone.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.520]   But if we may, let's fast forward a bit
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:52.680]   to a couple of years later.
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.800]   If you're willing to talk about it,
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.680]   maybe talk about some of the evolution that happened.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.400]   So you started working a job,
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.320]   you're getting back into civilian life.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:11.320]   And I recall a conversation about this time of year,
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:14.560]   probably about three years ago.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.000]   And you had done what a lot of
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.760]   vets from tier one operations have done and are now doing,
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.480]   which I actually have mostly a favorable outlook on,
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:33.680]   which is, now these are, I want to be very clear,
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.200]   legal and sanctioned explorations of the psychedelic space.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:39.040]   Right?
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.480]   And I remember you called me
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.640]   and you described the experience that you had had
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.720]   and some of the connection with warrior culture
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.080]   that that had helped emerge for you.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.760]   So could you explain what happened there?
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.840]   You know, probably the entry Andrew is as important,
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:59.200]   you know, meaning it's not all about books,
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:00.880]   but this is actually another thing I've really learned.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.640]   You know, I was very intellect and achievement central.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:09.880]   And as you can see how easy the emotion comes out now,
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.520]   I kind of very frighteningly understand
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.800]   people who like feel stuff a lot more.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.120]   It's a whole other landscape.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.520]   - It's miserable.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:21.280]   - Well, wait, yeah, it is.
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.440]   And yet it's, I agree.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:26.080]   It's a very uncomfortable space, you know,
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.800]   but we'll get, we'll get there.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.200]   - It's a journey for me, I put it that way.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:32.960]   So, you know, there's a bunch of other,
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:35.520]   I'm a voracious reader, I really enjoy it.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:39.560]   And, you know, my entree and little window
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.000]   into the world of getting that kind of help
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.280]   came from a lot of different areas.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:50.600]   I found in our area, a craniosacral therapist
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.080]   who it still seems like, 'cause I mentioned it to people
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:55.600]   and it sounds fringe to them.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:58.040]   It's a very light touch, not even chiropractic like,
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:00.880]   and it's closer to myofascial type of massage.
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:04.320]   - Some tapping, very light tapping on the top of the head.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:05.520]   - The part I actually love the most
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:08.720]   is the back of the neck sort of manipulation.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.920]   - You're lying down relaxed.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:12.580]   - Yeah, you're clothed, super easy in terms of that.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.880]   A couple of years of that, just 'cause of athletics,
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:19.400]   I love massage and that's kind of my entree.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:23.600]   - So through the body, somatics, yeah.
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.520]   - Which frankly, in many ways is my favorite,
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.880]   back to the physical orientation to the world
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.980]   is what's useful to me.
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:36.920]   But also, I mean, I read Sam Harris's first book,
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.400]   "End of Faith" in 2006.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.440]   And so I've followed him for 15 years, religiously,
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.600]   read all of his books, "Lying", "Moral Landscape".
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:50.620]   And his, I don't know him personally,
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:52.880]   so public stuff notwithstanding, that's not important to me,
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:57.880]   but waking up and I took an online course with Robert Wright
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:00.240]   who wrote "Why Buddhism is True",
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.960]   but that's really not what he's known for,
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:03.000]   Princeton professor.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.660]   He's so funny, he's very humorous.
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:10.720]   And I started to work my way into,
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:15.560]   I don't want people thinking I have some like whiz bang,
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.680]   like spiritual practice that's whatever,
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:20.880]   but it became very interesting to me, Andrew.
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.960]   I started to realize I needed to find a way
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.400]   to back away from the 24-hour ledge,
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.120]   like that super hyper focus.
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.600]   I needed to get a little bit of perspective.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.800]   One of my favorite short videos
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.800]   is Richard Feynman's "Pale Blue Dot".
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.840]   I needed to just back away.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.760]   It reminds me, thank you so much for talking
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:47.040]   about time-space bridging, I think, the other day.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.560]   - We make, I'll cue people to that clip in the caption.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:52.440]   It's a way of taking oneself
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:55.360]   out of one's immediate sphere of vision
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:58.560]   and literally looking further out into one's environment
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:00.760]   and then back again as a perceptual exercise
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:04.400]   of understanding that as our visual field expands,
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.760]   our perception of time also expands.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.080]   The binning, the chunking of time.
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:12.240]   That and my in-ear conversation years ago
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:17.240]   about horizon and activating the parasympathetic system
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.400]   instead of sympathetic, I just very slowly started
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:25.240]   to realize I needed to back away from the small picture
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:28.000]   and the reading and the cranial sacrum massage,
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.880]   and I was still not really getting consistent real help,
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.880]   but I thought I could do it
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.160]   through educating myself intellectually.
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.480]   And I thought it was time to, and it was,
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.960]   it has short-term consequences, but long-term,
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:48.960]   it's been amazing to deal with the plant medicines
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:51.960]   in a controlled and curated environment,
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.560]   and that experience was super safe
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:57.560]   and quite amazing, actually.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.560]   The weekend, or the three or four days was super intense,
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:04.760]   but I didn't leave there thinking,
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.240]   again, I kind of thought, "I'm good."
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.080]   That was great.
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.640]   - Yeah, a couple things.
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:16.180]   One, we've covered psychedelics on this podcast before.
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:18.800]   I'd say this not for liability reasons,
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:22.040]   but just to really to emphasize for people's safety,
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:23.440]   to protect them.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:26.320]   Plant medicines are illegal most places still.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:27.160]   This is changing.
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:31.760]   MDMA has been filed with the FDA as a potential treatment.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.680]   It's not yet legal.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.480]   These things have great power to heal
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:38.760]   in the right circumstances,
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.200]   and they also have great potential to harm
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.760]   in the wrong hands or circumstances,
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.760]   people with potential for psychosis, et cetera.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:53.800]   But with that said, I remember I was on,
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:57.120]   I was driving, I was on a phone call with you
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.240]   around this time of year, about three years ago,
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.920]   maybe it was four, but I think it was three years ago,
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:04.120]   and I said, "What was your experience
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:06.980]   "with Ibogaine DMT like?"
[02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:14.040]   And you said, "It was among the most profound experiences
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:16.280]   "of my entire life."
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.980]   And I recall you saying that you felt
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:21.560]   that it had connected you through time
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:24.880]   to all the warrior cultures that had preceded you,
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:28.200]   not just US military, but all warrior cultures.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.140]   And you sounded great.
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:34.680]   You sounded like better than great.
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:37.520]   You weren't high, but you just sounded like,
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:40.920]   man, like something had synced up.
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:43.680]   And I thought, well, this is great.
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:45.320]   And I hadn't explored plant medicines,
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.160]   at least not in a long time
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.200]   'cause I had done the recreationally as a youth,
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:49.400]   which I do not recommend.
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:50.760]   It took me down a bad path.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:53.360]   But, and more recently,
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.080]   I've explored them in controlled conditions.
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.400]   But I thought, awesome.
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:00.240]   - This worked.
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.580]   - This new job, you did some very controlled,
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:09.500]   and again, physician-assisted Ibogaine DMT experiences.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:12.280]   And you're telling me how great everything was.
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:13.500]   - Yep.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:16.520]   - And then about, I think it was about three,
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.780]   four months later, I got a very different call.
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:25.780]   And if you're willing, I remember that call.
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:28.020]   Maybe you can tell me about that call.
[02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:31.620]   - Yeah, so, I mean, the experience,
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:33.780]   it was incredibly powerful.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:37.080]   Humor is such a powerful way to get through hard times.
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:38.500]   That's why I'm laughing.
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:39.820]   But it really was, Andrew.
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:43.900]   I mean, to be fair to thousands of years
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:47.100]   of people having experience with these things,
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:52.020]   we often joked about like what poor sucker
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:54.600]   reached out and grabbed that root for the first time
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.820]   and chewed on it, the Iboga tree.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:57.860]   Boy, he found out.
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:16:59.800]   - Or she.
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:00.700]   - Or she, yeah.
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:01.540]   - To be fair.
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:04.920]   - To be fair, probably some session
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:06.340]   that wasn't supposed to go that direction
[02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:07.700]   and someone chewed on the wrong root.
[02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:10.960]   But it was extremely powerful.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:17.220]   I've heard that the 5-MeO for some people is not much.
[02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.720]   It's like black.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:24.060]   For me, it was just liftoff.
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:29.060]   And I saw an entirely perfect geometric mosaic
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:31.760]   in light blue and white.
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:37.540]   And that was the warrior culture connection.
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:41.740]   Like that whole 20-minute ride was just something else.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:44.260]   As you know, I guess--
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:45.100]   - I haven't done it, but--
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.220]   - Noetic is the word.
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:47.060]   - Noetic.
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.180]   - Yeah, that people use.
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:49.140]   And very difficult.
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:51.040]   I don't have the language for it.
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:54.020]   And a couple months later, the bottom dropped out.
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:57.760]   - Yeah, and I wanna talk about that now.
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.440]   I also wanna emphasize, I know a good number of people
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.080]   that have had the same experience you did
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:06.620]   with Ibogaine DMT through the Veteran Solutions Group.
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:10.880]   And I know Marcus and Amber Capone very well.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.680]   Actually, a bill just got passed in Congress
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.680]   that Dan Crenshaw helped spearhead to bring funding
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:23.020]   to use of psychedelics for PTSD treatment in military.
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:28.020]   And I should mention, 'cause this was interesting to learn,
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:30.780]   that that bill was highly bipartisan.
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:32.740]   I'm not gonna name off the names, 'cause if I do,
[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:35.380]   there's gonna be a lot of cringing, screaming, and yelling.
[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:38.180]   But it's like, if ever there was a bill
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:40.320]   that was supported from both sides of the aisle
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:42.960]   with the most diametrically opposed names
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.980]   who came together around that funding, it's that bill.
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:49.120]   And just striking.
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:52.060]   So, this is a very bipartisan thing.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:55.820]   So, I will say a number of people have been greatly benefited
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:58.080]   by the Veteran Solutions work.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.260]   And we can't causally link what happened to you afterwards
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:05.260]   to that at all. - There's a lot to it.
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.140]   - There's a lot of contextual stuff.
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:11.300]   So, we're not doing that, but we're an open book here.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:13.900]   And I think that's a great group, by the way.
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:15.340]   Veteran Solutions is amazing.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:19.660]   - A few months later, you said the bottom dropped out.
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.180]   So, what happened?
[02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:22.620]   And when did you start to notice it?
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.980]   And then maybe we can talk about that phone call.
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:28.780]   - Yeah, I think, you know, looking back, Andrew,
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:30.460]   I think a couple things.
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:32.940]   Most people who call me about, you know,
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:34.540]   friends who say, "Hey, should I go do this?"
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:38.340]   I initially tell them, well, 100% of the time,
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:40.940]   I tell them, "No, until."
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:46.240]   Until you get, I was having this conversation last week
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:48.200]   with a guy who I'd never met before.
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:51.780]   You need to stabilize your situation,
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:58.480]   whatever your situation is, through some very slow,
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:02.360]   deliberate, Dr. Conte-level help.
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:07.220]   Because in the case of, I'm happy to see that some people
[02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:09.500]   are using just a wider spectrum of on-ramp,
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:11.780]   not the nuclear option to start.
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:14.660]   I can tell you unequivocally, Ibogaine and 5-MeO DMT,
[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:16.560]   two days apart, is the nuclear option.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:17.920]   And it's not right for everybody.
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.120]   I'm not a scientist, there's no question.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:21.560]   That cannot be right for everybody,
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.320]   that just doesn't make any sense.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.600]   There's other ways to enter, I believe.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:27.160]   - And when you say the Conte option,
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:28.640]   well, just for those that didn't see the series
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.240]   with Dr. Paul Conte, we'll put a link to it
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:33.040]   in the show note captions, but what Coleman's referring to
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:35.800]   is talk therapy with somebody highly skilled,
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:40.240]   and perhaps also prescription medication,
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:42.440]   if that's necessary, maybe hormone therapy,
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:44.660]   if that's necessary, that's up to the physician.
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:49.460]   But clearly, talk therapy with a skilled clinician.
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:52.020]   - I believe I needed, I don't know what other people need,
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:57.020]   I needed a mentor to help me contextualize
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:00.300]   what I was coming from and what I'm going to.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:05.300]   And my experience with the plant medicines was,
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:08.940]   it kicked the door wide open
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:12.840]   and took that beautiful ice sculpture,
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:14.680]   perhaps at a person's wedding,
[02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:17.000]   and shattered it on the floor.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.680]   And I was, again, left alone, my fault, not anybody else's,
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:23.320]   left alone to figure out
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:27.040]   how to put that ice sculpture back together, piece by piece.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:31.840]   And my belief is I could have avoided that
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:34.200]   by having a much more deliberate process.
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.680]   So when suddenly the ice sculpture was on the ground
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.760]   and every bit of intellect that I built over,
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:46.760]   however long, four decades, I was flat on my back.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.800]   And as I told you, Andrew,
[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:54.560]   and I've been really verbal about with so many friends
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.760]   who only want to talk about it in quiet circles,
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:59.480]   which I totally understand and respect.
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:02.200]   And if you want to talk about it in a quiet circle,
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:05.080]   like email the HumorLag Podcast,
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.380]   and you can give them my cell phone number
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:07.800]   because I know how important it is
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:09.480]   to people in that stage,
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:14.360]   is that was another thing
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.800]   that I never thought was possible for humans.
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:22.920]   It was severe depression, severe.
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:26.200]   And I was so, because I guess
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:27.760]   I just never thought about it, again,
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:29.440]   or never had a mentor,
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:32.240]   the shocking thing, Andrew, was how shocked I was.
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:34.640]   It was like, if I had known something like this was real,
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:37.340]   not that I would have listened to anybody if they said it,
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:39.540]   but the most shocking thing was that, again,
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:42.300]   this could happen to me.
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:43.340]   And when it did happen,
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:48.340]   I was completely unequipped to deal with.
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:51.180]   It took, forget how weak,
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.960]   forget every other thing in my life.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:58.320]   It took 10,000X the energy
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.980]   of anything I've ever done in my life before
[02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:04.100]   to just put my feet on the ground in the morning.
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:06.660]   I could not PT, I couldn't run.
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:10.840]   Andrew, like, I could not fucking function.
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.940]   I did function somehow to some level,
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:17.560]   but it was so terrifying.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:21.820]   I just have, for anyone listening who has been through,
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.940]   I just have such incredible respect
[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:26.200]   for people who have dealt with it
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:28.820]   and have learned to get through something like that.
[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:29.660]   - Depression.
[02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:33.040]   - Oh yeah, or any, pick the title, right?
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.700]   Whatever tough situation someone's in emotionally,
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:38.220]   I have such tremendous respect for them
[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:41.500]   because I would have been, years ago,
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:44.980]   the guy who, like, just tighten up your boots and get to it.
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:46.140]   It's not possible.
[02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:49.280]   Like, you have to get help from people who care about you,
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.540]   and you have to, like, you have to step back away
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:56.500]   from the problem set somehow and work through it,
[02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:57.940]   you know, step-by-step.
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:23:59.220]   One of the most helpful things,
[02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:01.700]   and I'm so, feel so fortunate,
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.700]   that I never really had, like, the chemical dependence thing.
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:06.980]   It was easy for me to stop drinking.
[02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:08.620]   - When did you decide to stop drinking?
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.860]   - It was around three years ago or so-ish.
[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:13.300]   - Prior to this lapse into depression.
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:15.140]   - No, no, right during.
[02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:15.980]   Yeah, right during.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:18.420]   - You just figured alcohol's a bad thing right now.
[02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:20.500]   - Yeah, and I mean, look,
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:22.020]   you and I have been friends for a while now, Andrew.
[02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:24.260]   Some of the things you and I have discussed,
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:25.580]   and I hear you talk about publicly,
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:27.580]   they were just good reminders, you know?
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:31.460]   One of the things I absolutely hate, but I do every day,
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:34.140]   which is wait 90 minutes to drink coffee.
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:35.580]   Oh, it's the worst.
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.180]   I cannot tell you how much of a difference
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:39.620]   that's made in my energy throughout the day.
[02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:40.960]   And the drinking was similar.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:42.300]   You know, like, look,
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:44.300]   I'm just gonna drop it for a couple weeks,
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:48.140]   and then suddenly my sleep's better, my fitness is better.
[02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:50.380]   You know, so, you know, we all, even my friend,
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:51.620]   you know, you chat about stuff.
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:52.980]   Oh, what are you doing at this age?
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:54.220]   You know, I'm approaching 50.
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:55.500]   That helps you stop drinking.
[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:58.780]   Everything else, like, all the other recommendations
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:00.420]   come second, at least for me.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:03.380]   - Was that pretty easy for you to do?
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.020]   'Cause I know there's a big culture
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:06.180]   of drinking in the teams.
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:07.380]   - Yeah, I was just lucky.
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:12.380]   So, my point there is, you know,
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:16.060]   just the respect I have for people
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:18.180]   who work through stuff like that.
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:19.540]   And I was gonna say,
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:20.740]   the reason I referenced the drinking
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:23.380]   is because I started reading a lot about the 12 steps,
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:24.700]   AA, I've never been to a AA meeting,
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.460]   but the Simpsons, the PTSD, and the 12 steps,
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:30.940]   I'm like, oh my God, this is me.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:33.580]   Like, I need to go through these steps in my own way,
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:35.500]   not for, you know, not for drinking,
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.860]   but for whatever, this low-grade,
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:40.220]   the way I've described it is, you know,
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.580]   the Buddhists obviously call it dukkha,
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:45.500]   so unsatisfactoriness, this low-grade irritation
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:47.100]   that I carry around every day.
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:55.700]   The one amazing thing that that couple of months did for me,
[02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:57.060]   and the way I describe it visually,
[02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:00.300]   is if someone cut me from neck to belly,
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:04.780]   and filleted open my chest, and took a propane torch,
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:07.220]   and scorched me from the inside,
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:10.300]   and then put me back together, and said, "Start over."
[02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:12.340]   That's how it felt.
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:13.620]   That's literally how it felt.
[02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:15.740]   I mean, I could not believe, Andrew,
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:17.540]   and you can obviously, you know,
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:20.300]   Dr. Conte can articulate this better,
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:22.500]   I couldn't believe how emotional pain
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:24.060]   could be so physically painful.
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:28.500]   That whole experience, again,
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:30.820]   the shocking part was the shocking part.
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:33.220]   I just didn't think it was real.
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:36.380]   And so, then when it was, and I'm like,
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:39.580]   "How many fucking things do I have to deal with?"
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.740]   You know?
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:44.340]   And I realized everybody deals with a lot of stuff.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:46.460]   And it was challenging.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:51.340]   And then slowly, you know, it got better and better.
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:56.340]   And guys like, you know, friends, very close friends,
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:27:00.420]   a very, very small, tight group,
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:05.420]   were, man, what people do when you finally tell them,
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:14.300]   and you think, "Oh, this guy's gonna,
[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:17.260]   "he's never gonna talk to me again."
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:20.780]   They do the opposite.
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:24.740]   They rally immediately for you, you know?
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:27.140]   And then guys that aren't in your inner circle
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:29.100]   necessarily helping directly,
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:31.580]   and they're in the next circle.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.980]   'Cause now, this is very weird,
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.140]   it's back to like the feeling thing.
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:39.580]   I can, not 100% of the time,
[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:40.740]   but a lot of guys in my community,
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:42.940]   if I speak to them and they're in a bad spot,
[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:45.340]   I can detect it within five seconds.
[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:48.340]   Just the tonal and kind of like the tempo.
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:51.700]   And when you tell that ring of people,
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:56.500]   not your super inner circle, they dump it immediately.
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.580]   As soon as you open the door, they're like,
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:02.980]   "Hey, man, I had a couple of tough months," you know?
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.300]   Boom, they're right in for the most part.
[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:06.140]   - They open up.
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:07.140]   - Yep.
[02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:09.660]   And that really scares me, Andrew, because I know,
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:14.900]   like if we need to flip the switch this afternoon,
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:16.340]   like we can flip the switch.
[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:18.060]   - Meaning?
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:22.660]   - Meaning like, I can go to old school 15 years ago,
[02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:25.220]   that's what you and I have discussed in the past,
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:28.940]   has kind of come back to the fighter mentality is,
[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:33.940]   the problem with that, the hardcore, intense, focused,
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:36.940]   that's easy.
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:41.540]   Like, it's so easy to do that tough stuff.
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:42.940]   That's easy.
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:44.660]   This is the hard part.
[02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:48.180]   And that's what, you know, was so challenging.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:51.620]   It was to go to people who normally we do,
[02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:54.460]   you know, the, "Yeah, yeah, let's do this, let's do that.
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:55.460]   Let's do something crazy."
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:58.780]   Okay, well, tell that same person who you've built
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:04.060]   persona, identity, you know, around them and with them,
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:05.660]   they're like, "You're this guy."
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:07.980]   And then you have a tough spot.
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:09.660]   Now you have to go tell them the opposite.
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:13.420]   Like, "I'm really not doing well."
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:14.500]   It's terrifying.
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.700]   - It is terrifying.
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:21.780]   But I second with both arms,
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:26.460]   your statement that when we actually open up
[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:28.100]   to somebody trusted,
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:30.820]   hopefully a friend or somebody close to us,
[02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:34.020]   but like some people go to clergy or AA
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:36.820]   or any number of the different resources.
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:39.900]   And those resources really are out there at zero cost.
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:43.380]   They really are there if one has to look a little bit.
[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:46.900]   Sometimes a lot, unfortunately, but they're there.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:48.780]   My experience has always been,
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.540]   and in observing others,
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:53.380]   that there's something about the human spirit
[02:29:53.380 --> 02:29:54.580]   that wants to help.
[02:29:54.580 --> 02:29:55.420]   - Totally.
[02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:57.100]   - And sometimes that help comes from somebody
[02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:58.260]   who's really been through it.
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:00.860]   But even if somebody hasn't been through it,
[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:03.140]   there's something in our nervous system
[02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:06.060]   that sees real pain in somebody.
[02:30:06.060 --> 02:30:07.700]   And contrary to what we think,
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:09.660]   they don't judge and think that everything
[02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:12.260]   that the person who's hurting was before was a fraud.
[02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:15.280]   The contrary, they see it as an act of strength.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:20.260]   But it feels like hell to reveal that.
[02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:22.740]   And I totally agree.
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:24.060]   I think all the tough stuff,
[02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:30.420]   anything physical is like a fraction of the emotional pain.
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:34.180]   And thank you for highlighting the physical aspect
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:36.300]   of emotional pain,
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:38.740]   especially if one isn't accustomed to it.
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:40.220]   If one isn't accustomed to it.
[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:44.420]   But if you're willing,
[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:48.300]   how bad did it get?
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:53.300]   I mean, the call we had suggested it was bad.
[02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:55.620]   I sometimes refer to a line,
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:57.580]   and I'd be lying if I didn't admit
[02:30:57.580 --> 02:30:59.340]   that I've seen that line a few times in my life.
[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:01.500]   I've been right up next to it a few times.
[02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:04.460]   And now if I ever see it,
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:06.380]   I know to do many things
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:11.100]   when it first comes into my visual sphere.
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:12.500]   The line, of course, being the point
[02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:15.100]   at which one is considering taking their own life.
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:16.700]   Something that happens far too often,
[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.500]   even once is far too often.
[02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:21.940]   And we've sort of skirted around this topic.
[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:26.300]   After all the wartime stuff and the gunfights
[02:31:26.300 --> 02:31:27.980]   and people dying and the doorbells,
[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:29.620]   been a lot of friends of yours,
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:32.780]   and some of whom I know, but most of whom I don't.
[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:34.060]   - Two this year.
[02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:37.340]   - Who continue to kill themselves, to put it bluntly.
[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:41.220]   Where were you at with respect to that line?
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:43.380]   Because depression is one thing,
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.100]   there's mild depression, there's severe depression,
[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:46.100]   there's recurring depression,
[02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:48.420]   there's management, and on and on and on.
[02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:50.300]   But ultimately, that's the thing
[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:55.300]   that hopefully everyone's seeking to avoid.
[02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:57.800]   And it's a, yeah, how close were you?
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:00.780]   - I would say there was probably,
[02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:02.700]   I really wanna say one day.
[02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:04.340]   And the truth is, it was one day.
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:05.820]   - It lasted one day?
[02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:07.500]   - Being that close to the line.
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:09.100]   - But it only takes a moment to go.
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:10.580]   - That's the scary thing, right?
[02:32:10.580 --> 02:32:14.140]   And it probably lasted a couple of weeks,
[02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:17.380]   but there was only, back to the buds thing,
[02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:19.460]   like I never thought about quitting.
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:20.860]   I thought about it one day.
[02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:23.780]   - What was the thought?
[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:27.100]   - It was, I mean, sort of like the classic symptoms,
[02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:30.940]   Andrew, I was up all night sweating and shaking
[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:34.500]   and it's back to the shock of it.
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:37.860]   It was, okay, I actually was able to step,
[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:39.660]   like one of two things is happening.
[02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:46.700]   Either I am fundamentally bad.
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:50.500]   There's no way you can feel this bad and be good.
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:52.100]   So one of two things is happening.
[02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:57.100]   Like I'm just bad, a bad person, which I know is not true,
[02:32:57.540 --> 02:33:00.420]   or something bad got inside of me
[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.140]   that I have to get rid of,
[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:03.940]   and I don't know how to get rid of it.
[02:33:03.940 --> 02:33:08.420]   And so sweating, shaking, up at three in the morning
[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:12.740]   and legitimately thinking, this is just the scariest thing.
[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:14.980]   And for anybody in the situation,
[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:21.180]   you think with every ounce of your being
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.940]   that people are better off without you.
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:28.780]   And then somehow, thankfully through chemistry,
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.920]   neurobiology, past learnings,
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:37.940]   I stepped back away from that very quickly.
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:41.140]   But the feeling of putting me up to that line
[02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.380]   didn't go away.
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:44.380]   I just intellectually was able to,
[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:47.820]   it was kind of where the maladaptive behaviors,
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:49.940]   back to training work in your favor,
[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:51.680]   which is I'm not quitting.
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:55.660]   Like this can't be just me,
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.220]   even though it did feel like just me.
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:34:00.100]   I mean, you suddenly become the core
[02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:02.060]   of the entire existence of the universe.
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:03.840]   You think like you're it, you know?
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:07.880]   But in the negative side of it, not the adaptive side of it,
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:11.240]   because the pain is just so extreme.
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:14.820]   But I was able to back away from it.
[02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:18.780]   And then over, I'm so grateful to so many of my friends.
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:20.860]   I can't imagine how many hours,
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:22.860]   if we collect up those hours,
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:25.280]   how much time I spent with them on the phone.
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:31.220]   And one of my, in those really hard weeks,
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:32.340]   maybe a little bit after that injury,
[02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:33.180]   one of my buddies,
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.180]   I was actually just talking to him yesterday
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:35.620]   'cause I had time in the car.
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:41.380]   The tough love side of it,
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:43.920]   when you're feeling that poorly is a little tricky.
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:46.260]   Like I probably wouldn't deliver tough love
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:48.040]   unless I really thought the person could handle it.
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:50.420]   I think it's, you gotta really deal with kid gloves
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:52.380]   at those moments.
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:54.020]   But one of my buddies told me,
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:57.700]   if you do something to hurt yourself,
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:00.060]   you will have proven to every person who knows you
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:02.320]   that you are a fucking liar and a fraud.
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:06.260]   Everything you've been about your whole life is a fraud.
[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:08.960]   And Andrew, I was, we were on the phone.
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.960]   I was like, whoa, my God.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:15.140]   He just went 10 ring.
[02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:16.420]   I mean, dead center.
[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:19.300]   And it, that was a pivot.
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:21.820]   Like that really helped me a lot.
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:22.740]   - That's what you needed.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:26.480]   I mean, I don't know that that's what I would have needed.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:28.900]   I recall when we spoke,
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:31.220]   because I obviously not professionally trained
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:32.260]   in any of that.
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:34.740]   I just remember thinking, how do I put in this,
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:37.740]   this into language that Coleman's gonna understand?
[02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:40.780]   And I just said, you know, I think your goggles are,
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:41.860]   I know one thing for sure,
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:43.700]   which is that your goggles are foggy.
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:48.700]   So you gotta, so you have to outsource your decisions now.
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:50.620]   - I think you might've also told me
[02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:52.060]   to outsource my identity.
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:58.140]   And that helped a lot because it was that idea
[02:35:58.140 --> 02:36:00.320]   of you have foggy goggles.
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.700]   You're clearly like not on stable ground.
[02:36:03.700 --> 02:36:06.100]   Everything you believe about yourself,
[02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:08.340]   just let it be the spokes of a wheel
[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:11.660]   that somebody else can hold for you for a period of time.
[02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:13.340]   I was like, well, I can do that.
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:14.180]   And then my other buddy,
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:15.580]   I didn't want to be a liar and a fraud.
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:17.420]   I was like, I can do that.
[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:18.820]   (laughing)
[02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:23.060]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm grateful for the opportunity,
[02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:25.780]   but unfortunately I've had a few circumstances
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:29.900]   where people close to me were at that edge
[02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:33.020]   and I'd be lying if I didn't say I've been at that edge.
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.780]   So I knew where, I had some sense of where you were at.
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:38.220]   And under those conditions,
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:39.560]   I don't think there's a playbook.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:42.700]   I mean, obviously when people have a plan
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:44.300]   and they're thinking about implementing that plan,
[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:46.620]   those people need to be put under protection
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.640]   from themselves.
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:51.500]   Fortunately, it didn't come to that.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:53.460]   - And you know, a few friends just did the basics, Andrew,
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:57.460]   which was, I really wanted to talk to you at that time
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:59.220]   because I knew you would give me some advice.
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.700]   You know, I was so uncertain about just the,
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:02.540]   I'll just say the chemistry,
[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:05.180]   but the chemistry and like something is not right.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:07.860]   And you know, different friends offer different
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:12.260]   and some friends just sat and listened to it all.
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:13.960]   And when I think back, it's like,
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.260]   I would take a bullet for them
[02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:21.460]   'cause they just took it, you know, and let me offload it.
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:25.960]   It's an amazing experience for, let people help you,
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:28.980]   which I was never willing to do.
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:32.060]   - No, and you were, we have to highlight something
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:33.380]   that might've been overlooked earlier
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:34.460]   'cause we went through it quickly,
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:38.160]   but that you were, you know, you're a commander of a unit.
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:40.700]   So you're head of a family.
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:42.440]   I know Bridget's also head of family.
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:44.060]   There's a trade.
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:44.900]   - You try.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:45.720]   - You go back and forth.
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:47.060]   Right, exactly.
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:49.860]   But you're used to leading and protecting others.
[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:54.860]   And I think it's awesome that you're able to have access
[02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:59.740]   that raising your hand and asking for help.
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:00.580]   - You have to.
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:05.580]   - It's such a sign of strength and skill
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:08.760]   and it feels like the exact opposite in the moment,
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:09.980]   the exact opposite.
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:12.780]   And then we go to these narratives like,
[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:14.420]   oh, if I've ever done that in the past,
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:16.140]   people didn't help that, you know,
[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:17.460]   we come up with a million excuses,
[02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:22.420]   but in the end it's such a thing of strength to do that.
[02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:27.580]   So you did ratchet yourself out of that
[02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:29.180]   very, very dark hole.
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:30.380]   - Slowly.
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:33.980]   - And I wanna place this in the context
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:36.020]   of this hero's journey.
[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:38.340]   Would you see that, you talk about that,
[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:41.540]   the magic flight that you're against,
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:44.140]   you're like the refusal, you won't go back.
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:47.340]   But so it was accepting it seems that there was,
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.620]   that some pieces of you needed work.
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:50.880]   That there was this PTSD,
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:54.300]   this gentleman that you mentioned saw that
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:56.220]   and you refused to kind of deal with it.
[02:38:56.220 --> 02:39:00.980]   And so shine a light on it and God, the universe,
[02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:04.320]   whatever your beliefs are, forced you to see it.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:09.620]   And you went to the very bottom, but not out the bottom.
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:10.440]   - Yep.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:14.520]   - What was the process of putting things back together?
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:18.860]   - I mean, really, I mean, a lot of it, Andrew,
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:22.340]   was cutting out, so as a practical matter,
[02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:24.500]   I mean, I'm gonna go just go back to regular therapy
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:29.500]   'cause I don't, that, I mean, my therapist is amazing.
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:31.820]   - So you're now, at what point did you enter
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:33.060]   a quote, unquote, talk therapy?
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:33.900]   - Immediately then, immediately then.
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:35.420]   - So you got a quote, unquote, therapist.
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:36.260]   - Because, oh yeah, yeah.
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:39.560]   I mean, effectively, you know,
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.800]   Bridget and I in multiple, at some point,
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:47.420]   it was, Bridget was like, this is, this is it.
[02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:51.060]   Like, full-time help, effective immediately.
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:55.620]   And I knew it was necessary, but if I'm really honest,
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:39:58.020]   like, I would have avoided it.
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:00.460]   I would have somehow, like, tried to gut through
[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:03.860]   the situation without, like, full-time help.
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.300]   And I mean, once a week therapy, yeah.
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:07.820]   - So the idea of sitting down with somebody
[02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:10.060]   and talking about past, present,
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:12.860]   and maybe some ideas of future was worse to you
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:14.820]   than jumping out and playing at 3,000 feet
[02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:16.460]   or going into a gunfight?
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:19.740]   - Not even close, not even close.
[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:21.720]   And--
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.060]   - Hearing yourself say that, dude,
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:25.500]   you realize how--
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:26.340]   - Ridiculous.
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:30.420]   - Well, how untrue that must be at the physical level,
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:33.020]   but the nervous system doesn't know,
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:37.260]   to quote Dr. Balkanti, the limbic system
[02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:40.600]   that it experiences, or it creates this sense of fear
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:43.540]   and dread, doesn't know the clock or the calendar.
[02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:47.140]   It's like, if you go, meaning, if you experience that,
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:49.100]   there's the idea that it's gonna go on forever.
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:50.100]   I think that's the fear.
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:51.220]   - That's correct.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.640]   Yep, that's exactly right.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:53.620]   Thank you for saying that.
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:56.920]   The fear was, this will go on forever.
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:03.500]   But, so yes, I just did not want to,
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:07.060]   back to Bessel van der Kolk's,
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:08.340]   when I read this word in his book,
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:09.980]   Body Keeps the Score, alexithymia,
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:12.940]   if that's a real thing, where you can't put language
[02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:14.800]   to what's going on.
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:19.980]   I didn't want to put language to it.
[02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:22.420]   I couldn't, I just didn't feel like it.
[02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:25.380]   Like, I just felt like gutting through it.
[02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:30.100]   And then I got, you know, once a week therapy,
[02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:31.420]   amazing people.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:35.700]   And I don't know, Andrew, the first three months was,
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:39.140]   you know, I mean, gutting through,
[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:41.780]   I just couldn't, I couldn't seem to shed
[02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:46.120]   that emotional, like, burden of,
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:49.260]   pick the category of stuff from the last,
[02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:51.420]   what does it say, 20 years.
[02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:53.060]   It was just, but it was all,
[02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:54.300]   I couldn't stop it from coming out,
[02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:56.100]   and obviously that's a good thing.
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:59.740]   And so that just continued, and every day got,
[02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:01.940]   and when I say, this is the tough part,
[02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:05.420]   for at least me, and I know a lot of guys like me,
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:09.420]   the gains are minuscule, you know.
[02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:11.740]   But things improved, slowly but surely.
[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:13.100]   - Were there ever moments where you felt
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:14.960]   you were drifting backward?
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:18.220]   - Not really, and that was nice, you know?
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:22.400]   You see that, there's some stall, you know, plateaus.
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:24.900]   - You don't have to share this,
[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:28.300]   but, 'cause I'm a believer that talk therapy
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:31.420]   can be very effective, certainly that's my experience.
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:33.780]   I wouldn't be here if it weren't for two,
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.500]   in particular, amazing people
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:38.620]   who really helped me along the way, in that way.
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:40.780]   But I do think there's a place, at times,
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:44.180]   for pharmacology to assist the process.
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:45.900]   I know nowadays, people hear SSRIs,
[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:47.900]   and they demonize those, that wasn't,
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:51.140]   I'll come clean, and then maybe,
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:52.580]   if you feel like it, you can.
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:57.000]   I hit about a depression in my, during my post-doc,
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.720]   did a short run of Welbutrin bupropion,
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:04.340]   which is more of the dopaminergic, noradrenergic agonism,
[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:08.080]   mostly adrenaline, noradrenergic, it really helped.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:13.080]   It nuked my memory at the dosage they suggested,
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:17.040]   which meant I had to take a very low dose.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:18.280]   And then, eventually, I came off.
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.040]   And I think that that's one thing I learned from Conti,
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.960]   which is that most of these medications
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:24.920]   were designed to help people get over a bump,
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:26.280]   as opposed to be taken continuously.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:27.640]   Some people need to take 'em continuously.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:31.080]   I have been able to be away from that for a long time.
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:33.440]   But I think pharmacology can help.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:36.160]   - Oh, yeah, I think, I'd have to go back and look,
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.000]   four months, maybe, of pretty low dose of Welbutrin,
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:39.840]   thanks to, yeah.
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:41.240]   - Okay, that sounds, yeah, that's about right.
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:42.640]   - Yeah, thanks to my buddy, Jimmy.
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:46.280]   You know, I called him and asked him what he thought,
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:50.440]   and he said, "Well, you use a gun sight
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:51.640]   "on your weapon, don't you?
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:53.160]   "And you use glasses if you can't see."
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.080]   "No, I need reading glasses."
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:56.080]   "You need glasses if you can't see, right?"
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:58.480]   He's like, "Just fucking take the Welbutrin, man, chill.
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:01.280]   "Like, just get it, get some space,
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.400]   "back to the space-time bridging concept.
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:07.200]   "Just get back away from the danger for a few months."
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:08.680]   That really helped.
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:11.080]   - And that's very different than the backing away
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:15.200]   from the danger with, say, alcohol or drugs.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.080]   And look, my stance on cannabis
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.280]   is some people can use it safely.
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:20.920]   Most people probably cannot, but some can.
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:22.840]   But there's something different
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.360]   about the drugs that have an addiction potential
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:29.320]   or the drugs that disrupt sleep.
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:32.960]   Like, ultimately, if you look at people who commit suicide,
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:35.080]   and I've spent a lot of time with this literature,
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:39.120]   in almost every case in the preceding weeks,
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:41.120]   there's a disruption in sleep schedules,
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.160]   meaning disrupted from what they were doing
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:45.960]   prior to that when they were not feeling suicidal.
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:48.200]   So, then you think about alcohol disruption of sleep,
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:49.360]   even if you think you're sleeping.
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:51.560]   And, like, there's a story,
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:53.460]   like a common theme starts to emerge.
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:58.120]   So, you stabilize sleep, you were getting some dopamine
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:01.200]   and noradrenergic assistance from the low-dose Wobutrin,
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:02.920]   and you're basically also just-
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:03.760]   - Offloading.
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:06.320]   - You're just letting it all out with a therapist.
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.160]   - With a therapist.
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:09.360]   And the thing that strikes me is,
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:11.440]   to your point about my resistance to the therapy
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:13.440]   versus jumping on airplanes or whatever,
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:17.560]   the most important people in my whole life
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.720]   since day one have been people that have helped me.
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:23.840]   Coaches, parents, friends, boom.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:27.720]   Doug, work colleagues, the guys that I work for now.
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:31.000]   Like, you have all these people helping you,
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.000]   and then you hit this thing that's so unusual.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.380]   I'm like, I don't want anybody to help me,
[02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:38.360]   and I don't want to tell anybody about it.
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:39.800]   It's like, what is that, Andrew?
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:42.360]   That was the, it's like, what is that?
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:45.200]   And it's not like I wasn't in these environments
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.080]   where I've been coached and mentored.
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.880]   Like, I've had coaches and mentors on my ass
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.560]   my whole fucking life.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:53.780]   Like, instructors, you know, it's a nonstop.
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:57.880]   And I don't know, like, I couldn't,
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:00.320]   I just couldn't do it until I did it.
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:04.060]   And then, and you know, it's been a process since,
[02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:05.240]   and I'm super grateful for it.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:07.880]   And I don't know where we are in the journey,
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:09.600]   but in terms of, like, the hero's journey,
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:12.280]   but I hope I'm at freedom to live some version of it,
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.760]   because with my, this is dangerous,
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:17.800]   'cause I only say this, like, with my really, really,
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:18.720]   really close friends.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:20.560]   I know this is going to more people than my close,
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.660]   I feel like a completely different person.
[02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:27.060]   And none of that stuff really ever goes away.
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:28.420]   It's all a process, right?
[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:30.400]   And I'm never gonna stop the process,
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:36.280]   but I don't even recognize myself in some ways anymore.
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:39.120]   And that's been a good thing,
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:42.460]   because in those times when I was just
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:45.440]   on the 24-hour horizon sometimes,
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:47.920]   I just did not know what the fuck was going on
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:50.960]   other than exactly what I was doing, you know?
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:55.440]   And it's just an odd experience to be in a different place.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:00.760]   And it's scary to know that without that experience
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:05.200]   and without people really kind of forcing me to get help
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:08.800]   and things forcing me, I might be doing the same stuff,
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:11.040]   which is a hard way to live, you know?
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.440]   - Or worse. - Or worse.
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:13.280]   - You might not be here.
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.280]   - Or worse, which has happened to many of,
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:16.120]   our buddies, you know?
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:19.720]   And I wanna go like retroactively hug them
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:22.360]   and collect them up in like a net and say,
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:25.400]   "Guys, just stop for a second."
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:27.260]   You know, like we,
[02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:31.400]   it doesn't have to go there.
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:36.700]   - Yeah, I feel that the yearning in that statement,
[02:47:36.700 --> 02:47:41.700]   I suffer from a terrible,
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.600]   very destructive, debilitating desire
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.360]   to travel back in time and fix things.
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.680]   It's like, I know I don't have,
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:53.880]   my graduate advisor, who unfortunately,
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:55.300]   all three of my graduate advisors are dead,
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:59.240]   but she used to say, "My time machine's broken."
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:03.180]   Anytime I'd raise something that coulda, woulda, shoulda,
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:05.160]   "My time machine's broken," and we know that.
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:09.000]   But I felt that statement in every cell of my body.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.420]   It's clear you would.
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:14.040]   - But you're also, in sharing this experience
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:16.920]   and this information, you're doing that now
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:21.800]   in what we call in biology, in the interograde fashion.
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:24.800]   And, you know, somebody, many people are gonna hear this
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:28.400]   and cue to the recognition of what's happened to them,
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:30.200]   hopefully before they get to that line.
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:35.200]   - Yeah, you have to, and you just gotta tell somebody.
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:38.760]   You know, it's like, it's crazy how simple that is, Andrew.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:41.640]   I mean, months, I was like, "I can't tell anybody."
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:42.480]   - I can't tell anybody.
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:45.320]   - Well, and maybe we drill into this a little bit deeper,
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:46.640]   'cause I think that this really speaks
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.840]   to the global experience of being human,
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:53.040]   where, unlike a physical wound,
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:55.560]   where, you know, if you see bone exposed,
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:57.040]   you're like, "This is pretty serious."
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:58.440]   You know, we all have different thresholds
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:00.300]   for what we can tolerate in terms of pain
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:02.100]   and seeing ourselves wounded.
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:04.240]   We all don't have to decide what's the difference
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:06.440]   between hurting and injured.
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:09.480]   But when it comes to psychological stuff, we don't know.
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:11.800]   You know, we also are dealing with a world now
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:14.040]   where some people feel psychologically injured
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.320]   by everything, you know, so that's the extreme there.
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.320]   But I think what comes through,
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.840]   and I think people need to perhaps highlight in their minds
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:28.480]   is when something's kind of nagging or scratching
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:30.120]   at you beneath the surface, that voice,
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:31.840]   what do you think that voice is?
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.120]   - I call it the low-grade pain.
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:37.440]   Okay, for me, it was, there was a low-grade,
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:43.120]   just slight hot burning starting in '07,
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:50.920]   probably before that, but it was, for me,
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:56.200]   it was a weird mix, Andrew, of like an uncertainty,
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:00.960]   a seeking, a, this just doesn't feel right.
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:03.280]   Like, it has to be fixed.
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:05.560]   There has to be an intellectual,
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:08.960]   an achievement way to sort of get around,
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:12.000]   this is where the Buddhist writing and thinking
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.400]   really helped me a lot, there has to be a way
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.400]   around this low-grade unsatisfactoriness somehow.
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:25.480]   My sense for me, and I'm obviously not, you know,
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:26.960]   the Dr. Conte in the room,
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:30.720]   just because of all the things I've learned,
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:34.920]   it just had to be this constant,
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:36.720]   I'll use the word trauma, but for me,
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:40.040]   it was like something had to happen to our system,
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:42.560]   obviously it does, something happens to our system
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.160]   that is a little bit of a, boom, there's a shock there,
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:47.400]   boom, and then a buddy gets killed,
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:49.240]   and then it's not even always with death,
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:53.420]   then you have extreme firefight, or close call,
[02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:56.200]   and then it's just boom, boom, shock, shock, shock, shock.
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:50:59.160]   It's almost like getting TBI for the nervous system.
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:01.760]   It's just a constant high, to me,
[02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:05.440]   it always felt like that constant high end.
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:09.180]   Now, if you keep going, perhaps,
[02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:10.820]   if you never recognize any of it,
[02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:13.560]   and you just keep jacking the dopamine and the adrenaline
[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:15.860]   your whole life, maybe you can just never recognize it,
[02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:18.000]   but for me, when I shut the engine off,
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:22.140]   and I decided it's not really how I wanted to live,
[02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:24.960]   and I was trying to work out of that low-grade,
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:28.640]   whatever I was, residue that I was left with,
[02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:34.040]   it was like every time I came home from deployment,
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:35.760]   I would get sick that night.
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:39.260]   Like, I would have a fever that night, headache and fever,
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:41.960]   and I tend to get sick at the end of the year.
[02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:43.240]   Last two years, it was Christmas.
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:44.880]   This year, it was Thanksgiving,
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:47.640]   and Bridget and I always joke about it.
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:51.040]   It's 'cause I slightly turn the engine down a little,
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:53.120]   and then the immune system--
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:53.960]   - Yeah, that's the way it works.
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:56.960]   Everyone thinks stress depletes the immune system,
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:59.520]   and indeed, it can, but if you think about it
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:03.160]   in evolutionary adaptive ways,
[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:06.400]   go, go, go, go, go allows you to stave off the infection,
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:08.280]   or at least to not have the symptoms
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:10.760]   of combating infection, and then when you relax a little bit,
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:12.640]   go on vacation, boom, you get sick,
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:14.840]   which is not to say constantly stress,
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:16.760]   but you need to modulate.
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:17.980]   - Right. - You gotta modulate.
[02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:19.800]   But when you're on deployments, you don't have the option.
[02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:20.640]   - No, you don't, yeah.
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:21.480]   - You're in gunfights every day.
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:23.240]   - Yeah, so as soon as you turn it off, you get sick, right?
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:25.320]   But for me, in this particular instance,
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.240]   what do I think it is?
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:29.920]   I think it was all of those experiences at once,
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:32.040]   turning the generator all the way off,
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:33.960]   or the electric panel fully off,
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:37.280]   and then it just all came out.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:43.140]   - Well, for people or anyone listening
[02:52:43.140 --> 02:52:47.120]   who is facing that feeling, that underlying feeling,
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:52.120]   or who is challenged with a breakup,
[02:52:52.680 --> 02:52:56.560]   loss of a loved one, fear about the future,
[02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:00.240]   languishing because they don't know what the future holds,
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:05.240]   or the feeling that, quote-unquote, so much has happened,
[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:09.960]   or some combination of those five things,
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:14.880]   where do you think the healing process starts?
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:18.320]   - I hope, again, back to the hero's journey,
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:19.920]   I hope for every single person
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:22.860]   that it's not a rock-bottom moment,
[02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:26.520]   but it seems like if you follow a lot of,
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:28.820]   enough people, and you hear enough stories,
[02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:32.560]   you've talked with Dax, right?
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:33.720]   - Dax Shepard, yeah.
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:35.000]   - He talks about it nonstop.
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:38.120]   Like, unfortunately, I think a version of bottom
[02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:40.320]   is where the process starts.
[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:44.740]   All the people I know, the stories they tell me,
[02:53:44.740 --> 02:53:49.400]   the process started when they hit some version of bottom.
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:51.100]   What's the quote that I love is,
[02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:54.680]   "You don't change until the pain of staying the same
[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:56.600]   "is worse than the pain of change."
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:58.800]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:01.760]   I have experienced that more times
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:03.240]   than I would like to admit.
[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:04.200]   And that brings me, actually,
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:07.360]   to this more macroscopic question.
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:10.680]   My understanding of the hero's journey from,
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.540]   obviously, I haven't read or listened to the book,
[02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:15.220]   is that we don't complete this cycle
[02:54:15.220 --> 02:54:17.280]   and then rest at the ordinary world
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:22.280]   where we are living in bliss and peace forever.
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:25.360]   We actually have to go around that wheel
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:28.320]   over and over and over again.
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:30.440]   Hopefully, not going to bottoms
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:32.000]   that put our lives in danger,
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:37.000]   but it is not a process in which we ever really get to cruise.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:43.600]   So, let's orient Coleman Ruiz in that cycle.
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:46.920]   You seem to have returned to the ordinary world.
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:52.620]   For those listening and not watching,
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:57.500]   whenever you describe the feeling of getting through,
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:01.320]   but also that people assisted you, you smile.
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:04.260]   As friendly a guy as you are,
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:05.700]   I think in the first three years I knew you,
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:06.900]   I didn't see you smile once.
[02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:07.900]   - That's probably true.
[02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:09.220]   - I didn't see you smile once.
[02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:10.780]   I just thought like,
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:14.260]   and these tier one team guys, they're serious.
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:15.100]   - They're locked in.
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:19.740]   - They're locked in, but you smile a lot now.
[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:22.140]   So, I think you're back in the ordinary world.
[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:26.260]   What are the things you're watchful for?
[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:30.060]   You're not drinking, you pay attention to your sleep.
[02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:31.300]   You always train, you always did it.
[02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:33.060]   You call it PT, but physical training.
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:33.980]   - Yeah, yeah, I train pretty hard.
[02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:35.380]   - Cycle, run.
[02:55:35.380 --> 02:55:37.140]   - Swim, lots of kettlebells.
[02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:38.540]   - Yeah, every morning?
[02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:43.060]   - I train probably five out of seven days
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.780]   and the two days that I don't train,
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:47.100]   I'm in, I have a sauna at my house.
[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:49.100]   I'm in sauna at least for an hour.
[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:52.060]   - So funny how team guys talk about getting into cold
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:54.180]   or getting in the sauna, like it's just a regular thing.
[02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:56.660]   Like they never post it to social media.
[02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:58.660]   For them it's just, it's part of the routine.
[02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:00.300]   But I say that because I think a lot of people think
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:02.700]   it's like this esoteric biohacking thing.
[02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:04.740]   Wrestlers and people in the military
[02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:07.700]   are custom to like sauna cold, sauna cold,
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:10.220]   just like cardio lifting weights.
[02:56:10.220 --> 02:56:12.220]   It's not this esoteric thing.
[02:56:12.220 --> 02:56:14.780]   I mean, I think on average, there's a sauna in Finland
[02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:16.220]   for like every single person in the country.
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:19.300]   So we didn't invent some amazing recovery process
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:20.260]   by doing sauna.
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:24.580]   - Right, what do you think it is about physical movement
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:25.700]   that helps the mind?
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:28.700]   Obviously it's not, I consider it necessary,
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:29.940]   but not sufficient.
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:31.500]   Like you need to do the talk therapy,
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.300]   the working through, the writing, the reading,
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:36.380]   the introspection, the talking to other people,
[02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:40.300]   maybe pharmacology, but it does seem to be so important
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:41.820]   for resetting us.
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:43.860]   What do you think it is about physical movement?
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:46.900]   - I mean, since, it might go back to John Rady's
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:48.220]   little anecdote in "Spark," you know,
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:50.100]   the sea squirt, I guess, swims around,
[02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:51.820]   then as soon as it does whatever it needs to do,
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:53.020]   it just dies when it stops moving.
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:56.940]   - Oh yeah, so the sea squirt is this aquatic animal,
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:01.940]   a plesia, as it were, that when it lands on a rock
[02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:04.180]   and stops moving, it actually digests
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.220]   its own nervous system.
[02:57:05.220 --> 02:57:08.500]   That movement is the great Nobel prize-winning scientist,
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:09.640]   Sherrington, that said that movement
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:10.700]   is the final common pathway.
[02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:12.980]   That movement is the way that the nervous system
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:15.700]   tells the brain and rest of nervous system
[02:57:15.700 --> 02:57:18.640]   that it's still needed here on earth.
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:24.900]   Which I like, it's like a, it reminds us of our own utility.
[02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:26.220]   - Yeah.
[02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:27.860]   - In a neural way.
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:30.460]   - I mean, whatever that is, and you're right,
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:33.060]   the chemistry and the neurobiology of it all,
[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:35.340]   this goes back, again, going back to seventh grade.
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:37.380]   I was at the end of the rope on the detentions
[02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:41.220]   in the suspension, and I have this very clear memory
[02:57:41.220 --> 02:57:43.980]   that before my dad got home, I ran laps,
[02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:46.940]   I don't know how many, but a lot around the block.
[02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:49.740]   And by the time he got home, I was like,
[02:57:49.740 --> 02:57:51.580]   whatever my punishment is, I'm good.
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:52.860]   Like, I'm not worried about it.
[02:57:52.860 --> 02:57:55.640]   That physical activity for me all the time,
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:57.560]   I don't wanna overdo the runner's high thing,
[02:57:57.560 --> 02:58:00.540]   but whatever that is, that's what I think it is.
[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:03.180]   Like, when I'm in motion or my heart rate's up,
[02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:07.560]   for the most part, everything's fine.
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:13.500]   And I'm clear-headed, and I cannot be,
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:15.500]   again, dropping the drinking.
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:17.780]   I can't be lethargic and sit around.
[02:58:17.780 --> 02:58:20.580]   Like, I have to take care of myself in that regard.
[02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:23.820]   I watch my sleep super close.
[02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:26.200]   If it gets past 10.30, I'm in like a full-blown panic.
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:27.900]   I need to get to a pillow.
[02:58:27.900 --> 02:58:28.860]   The basics.
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:31.520]   Like, I don't do anything crazy, really.
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:34.420]   - You eat what you want?
[02:58:34.420 --> 02:58:35.380]   - No, no.
[02:58:35.380 --> 02:58:38.380]   I would say on the neurotic scale of things,
[02:58:38.380 --> 02:58:40.260]   that's probably my most extreme.
[02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:42.500]   There's probably a little bit of cutting weight,
[02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:45.220]   kind of like eating disorder issues, if I was guessing.
[02:58:45.220 --> 02:58:46.060]   Not that extreme, but-
[02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:47.700]   - So you eat meat, vegetables?
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:48.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:58:48.700 --> 02:58:50.340]   But I'm a really light eater.
[02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:54.680]   I eat like a bird and probably eight times a day, maybe more.
[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:57.220]   - Eight times a day?
[02:58:57.220 --> 02:58:58.060]   - Oh, easily.
[02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:01.420]   I'll have, you know, thanks to you,
[02:59:01.420 --> 02:59:03.180]   I'll wait an hour and a half to have coffee,
[02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:04.860]   which is miserable.
[02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:05.700]   - You're welcome.
[02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:06.540]   - But, oh, it's amazing.
[02:59:06.540 --> 02:59:07.360]   Thank you.
[02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:08.340]   It's helped me so much.
[02:59:08.340 --> 02:59:11.660]   - Well, you know, I take some shit for it
[02:59:11.660 --> 02:59:13.960]   because some people say, "Do I have to?"
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:15.580]   Well, if I train first thing,
[02:59:15.580 --> 02:59:17.020]   then I'll have my coffee first thing.
[02:59:17.020 --> 02:59:19.580]   It was really to stave off the afternoon crash.
[02:59:19.580 --> 02:59:22.820]   But a lot of people find that experiencing
[02:59:22.820 --> 02:59:26.220]   that natural wake up, and look, it's 90 minutes.
[02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:28.820]   It's not like cutting out for two days or two weeks.
[02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:30.260]   And Michael Pollan, I think, quit coffee.
[02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:32.380]   And I was like, "Why in the world would you do that?"
[02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:33.420]   - Yeah, why in the world?
[02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:35.100]   I love coffee, love yerba mate,
[02:59:35.100 --> 02:59:38.120]   always have from first sip.
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:40.220]   Which, by the way, I had my first gourd of mate,
[02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:42.160]   caffeinated mate, when I was four.
[02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:43.700]   There's a picture of me in my grandfather's lap.
[02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:44.540]   - That's hilarious.
[02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:45.500]   - Argentine side, yeah.
[02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:50.260]   So, but the point here is that, you know,
[02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:51.740]   these practices, these things,
[02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:54.020]   I think that they involve a little bit of discipline,
[02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:57.260]   but they really can have an outsized effect, I think.
[02:59:57.260 --> 02:59:58.340]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:59:58.340 --> 02:59:59.820]   Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:59:59.820 --> 03:00:02.820]   - I mean, the eating thing, and then maybe, you know,
[03:00:02.820 --> 03:00:04.820]   one more mental thing in this regard.
[03:00:04.820 --> 03:00:11.860]   I'll probably have maybe an avocado in the morning,
[03:00:11.860 --> 03:00:15.820]   and then two hours later, maybe one hour later,
[03:00:15.820 --> 03:00:18.940]   I'll have sliced cheese and an apple.
[03:00:18.940 --> 03:00:19.780]   And then--
[03:00:19.780 --> 03:00:20.900]   - So you're a light grazer.
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:22.020]   - Really light.
[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:25.420]   I'll probably have the smallest plate at dinner in my house.
[03:00:25.420 --> 03:00:26.900]   - We've always been in great shape.
[03:00:26.900 --> 03:00:29.780]   Like visually, you're tall, you're lean, you're strong.
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:30.620]   - Yeah, thanks.
[03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:31.460]   - Yeah.
[03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:34.540]   I think we're realizing now that you can still train on,
[03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:36.340]   you don't have to be like gorging oneself with calories.
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:37.300]   - Yeah, especially now, right?
[03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:39.020]   Like we're both approaching 50.
[03:00:39.020 --> 03:00:41.900]   It's actually surprising how much I've discovered
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:43.740]   we can do on how few calories.
[03:00:43.740 --> 03:00:47.060]   And I'm not trying to like test it some crazy way,
[03:00:47.060 --> 03:00:49.340]   but then just eat throughout the day.
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:51.180]   And, you know, macro life experience,
[03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:54.140]   I just cut a bunch of extra bullshit out of my life,
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:55.860]   big and little things.
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:01:00.860]   Like I try to just do my job and, you know,
[03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:05.340]   do a good job at it and hang out with my people,
[03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:10.020]   friends and family and all the extra shenanigans.
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:11.380]   Like I'll maybe do, you know,
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:14.020]   I was always doing some big race
[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:16.060]   or some big mountaineering adventure,
[03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:19.260]   or I was just piling stuff into my schedule.
[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:23.820]   I might do one race in like in the spring.
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:26.900]   Everything else is casual, work really hard at it.
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:28.100]   I like cycling a lot.
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:30.220]   It's one of my favorites and go hard,
[03:01:30.220 --> 03:01:33.220]   but I'm not trying to race cat too,
[03:01:33.220 --> 03:01:36.380]   or, you know, win some event,
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:40.900]   or that release of extra bullshit in my life
[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:43.380]   has been as big as anything else.
[03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:45.140]   - And your boys presumably take some time
[03:01:45.140 --> 03:01:46.260]   and attention in here.
[03:01:46.260 --> 03:01:47.100]   - Yeah, they're great.
[03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:51.900]   - Yeah, your son's a runner for university level runner.
[03:01:52.780 --> 03:01:57.780]   A lot of our conversation gets to some kind of core features
[03:01:57.780 --> 03:02:03.780]   of being human and the psychology of challenge
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:06.820]   and thinking one is, or others are invincible,
[03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:09.980]   discovering that none of us are invincible,
[03:02:09.980 --> 03:02:11.700]   but that we are renewable.
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:13.580]   You clearly illustrate that.
[03:02:13.580 --> 03:02:18.380]   There's clearly a message
[03:02:18.380 --> 03:02:21.860]   that everyone is gleaning from this, many messages,
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:26.860]   but like what, if any, revision or adaptation
[03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:33.820]   do you think we need of the concept of being a man,
[03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:36.100]   growing oneself into a man?
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:40.420]   You know, I'm not a gender studies sociologist,
[03:02:40.420 --> 03:02:42.060]   psychologist, neuroscientist,
[03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:47.060]   but setting all the sociology and the nomenclature aside,
[03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:50.700]   like if you had a short list of things,
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:54.660]   like it seems like you believe
[03:02:54.660 --> 03:02:58.060]   that it's important to be able to do hard things,
[03:02:58.060 --> 03:02:59.300]   but sometimes those hard things
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:02.100]   are not the hard things that you aren't,
[03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:04.300]   we think they are like sitting down and telling one story,
[03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:08.220]   being more terrifying than going into gunfights overseas.
[03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:09.740]   - Yeah.
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:13.500]   Yeah, I mean, it's funny that the prelude a little bit
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:15.340]   is I'm not a gender studies scientist,
[03:03:15.340 --> 03:03:16.300]   either a sociologist.
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:18.700]   I stay away from most of these conversations.
[03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:19.540]   You know?
[03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:22.340]   - But they're barbed wire.
[03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:25.060]   - Yeah, people seem to be so over activated over stuff.
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:30.060]   It's very odd, but for me and my life experience,
[03:03:30.060 --> 03:03:33.140]   Andrew, it's range.
[03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:34.860]   Like to use David Epstein's book title, right?
[03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:35.820]   It's range.
[03:03:35.820 --> 03:03:41.900]   And I've noticed this so much because of parenting
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:44.260]   and watching my boys grow into men.
[03:03:44.260 --> 03:03:48.540]   If I think about, I'm gonna come back to range.
[03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:51.740]   If I think about myself at 17 or 18,
[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:56.340]   not my parents, not my coaches,
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:57.700]   unless I really wanted it,
[03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:00.220]   you could not fucking tell me what to do.
[03:04:00.220 --> 03:04:01.820]   You can't tell me what to do now.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:04.700]   Like if I want it, I love the mentoring and the teammateship
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:07.020]   and the things that get you where you wanna go.
[03:04:07.020 --> 03:04:10.140]   But if it's something I don't wanna do, I'm not doing it.
[03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:11.580]   You know, no matter what.
[03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:15.620]   And so if I think about that in terms of being a dad
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:20.180]   or manhood is, let's take it back to my kids.
[03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:23.540]   Like I think one of the most important parts of my job
[03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:28.020]   is to release the grip and take the reins off
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:33.020]   and just barely keep them inside the boundaries of alive.
[03:04:33.020 --> 03:04:36.820]   You know, 'cause they're gonna make
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:39.860]   all their own decisions anyway, and they have to, right?
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:43.500]   And so I think a big part that I see,
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:46.500]   and I saw myself a lot for years,
[03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:49.300]   was we over-grip sometimes as men,
[03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:53.060]   like we are so afraid of losing control
[03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:55.540]   in an already uncontrollable world
[03:04:55.540 --> 03:04:58.540]   that we over-grip everything.
[03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:00.980]   And I over-gripped everything.
[03:05:00.980 --> 03:05:04.420]   And suddenly when I'm not over-gripping stuff,
[03:05:04.420 --> 03:05:07.380]   things are going better.
[03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:11.300]   And when it comes to range, it's okay.
[03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:14.460]   For me, it's okay to have your tough guy moments,
[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:16.020]   your fighter mentality moments.
[03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:17.340]   I would never wanna lose that
[03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:20.540]   because no matter how much help I get
[03:05:20.540 --> 03:05:23.180]   when I'm out with my family or my wife or my boys,
[03:05:23.180 --> 03:05:24.580]   my head is on a fucking swivel.
[03:05:24.580 --> 03:05:27.900]   And if somebody touches them, it's curtains.
[03:05:27.900 --> 03:05:30.380]   And we need to keep that
[03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:33.420]   because that is just a part of life.
[03:05:33.420 --> 03:05:35.220]   Like you have to be,
[03:05:35.220 --> 03:05:38.140]   you cannot move through life with blinders on.
[03:05:38.140 --> 03:05:41.100]   Like there are people who are not good people.
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:42.740]   And it's okay to have range
[03:05:42.740 --> 03:05:45.220]   and have that in your toolkit.
[03:05:45.220 --> 03:05:48.140]   What I don't think is okay to do
[03:05:48.140 --> 03:05:51.340]   is to let that slice of the traditional,
[03:05:51.340 --> 03:05:53.420]   whatever you wanna call it, aggressive manhood,
[03:05:53.420 --> 03:05:54.700]   be your whole life.
[03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:56.260]   Like that's just not functional.
[03:05:56.260 --> 03:05:57.300]   It's not good for relationships.
[03:05:57.300 --> 03:05:59.100]   It's not good for parenthood.
[03:05:59.100 --> 03:06:02.820]   So every other little tool you can put in that toolbox
[03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:05.020]   that takes you all the way over here
[03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:06.820]   to what we might consider,
[03:06:06.820 --> 03:06:09.700]   oh, Coleman, he's soft now.
[03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:12.620]   No, no, don't mistake my kindness for weakness.
[03:06:12.620 --> 03:06:14.700]   There's a category for everything.
[03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:16.300]   And I think that makes you such
[03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:17.900]   a much more complete person.
[03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:21.300]   It's made me a more complete person.
[03:06:21.300 --> 03:06:22.620]   It's difficult.
[03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:26.100]   I feel like I'm brand new
[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:29.180]   at being able to do other things in my toolbox.
[03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:31.180]   Like this part's easy.
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.340]   I can go jump to that in a nanosecond.
[03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:37.460]   This part over here of normalizing life
[03:06:37.460 --> 03:06:40.420]   across whatever, 80, 90,
[03:06:40.420 --> 03:06:45.420]   it's really hard to sort of excavate the normal shit.
[03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:49.060]   But that's what I think we need to do.
[03:06:49.060 --> 03:06:54.060]   I mean, it's okay to be kind and calm and gentle
[03:06:54.060 --> 03:06:59.060]   and there's nothing wrong with that.
[03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:01.820]   - And I'm guessing the word surrender
[03:07:01.820 --> 03:07:04.820]   probably held a far different meaning for you in the past.
[03:07:04.820 --> 03:07:05.900]   A lot of what you're describing
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:07.620]   is surrendering to the realities of life
[03:07:07.620 --> 03:07:10.100]   that we can't control everything.
[03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:13.660]   And just how painful it is to undergo that surrender.
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:15.140]   And here I'm talking to myself too.
[03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:18.380]   It's a process I'm still deeply involved in.
[03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:22.100]   Somebody who's tried to go rung over rung as best I can.
[03:07:22.100 --> 03:07:24.100]   - Doesn't Andrew speak to our like evolutions?
[03:07:24.100 --> 03:07:25.860]   Like that is so difficult,
[03:07:25.860 --> 03:07:27.660]   at least for me and guys like me.
[03:07:27.660 --> 03:07:29.900]   I'm putting you in my group here.
[03:07:29.900 --> 03:07:30.980]   That is so hard to do.
[03:07:30.980 --> 03:07:33.260]   Like that just tells me more about
[03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:37.140]   the evolution of our male system.
[03:07:37.140 --> 03:07:40.780]   Like that part's so easy and this part is not so easy.
[03:07:40.780 --> 03:07:44.660]   But man, it's a battle to remind myself,
[03:07:44.660 --> 03:07:49.860]   slow down, listen, just the basic shit.
[03:07:49.860 --> 03:07:51.540]   You don't have to go attack every problem
[03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:55.540]   like a fist fight, it's tough.
[03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:56.380]   - It is tough.
[03:07:56.380 --> 03:07:59.420]   And I think that the more that I resist surrender,
[03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:02.620]   the more that, well, I believe in God.
[03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:04.500]   So I'll just say God, but God, the universe
[03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:05.500]   or whatever it is for people.
[03:08:05.500 --> 03:08:08.180]   But for me, the more that God places me in circumstances
[03:08:08.180 --> 03:08:11.740]   that make the act of surrendering harder.
[03:08:11.740 --> 03:08:13.060]   Like if I would just do it on my own,
[03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:14.080]   it wouldn't have to be so hard.
[03:08:14.080 --> 03:08:16.140]   I wouldn't have to, a good friend of mine,
[03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:19.660]   I'll mention my name, Tim Armstrong.
[03:08:19.660 --> 03:08:21.400]   He just said like,
[03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:24.300]   you got to hit every branch on the way down.
[03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:26.380]   He was telling me I had to.
[03:08:26.380 --> 03:08:28.700]   He's like, you're a stubborn punk rocker, you have to.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:30.060]   And he was talking about himself too.
[03:08:30.060 --> 03:08:33.580]   Like there's certain phenotypes where we have to,
[03:08:33.580 --> 03:08:36.400]   but they're like the universe just screams out.
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:39.260]   You don't have to.
[03:08:39.260 --> 03:08:40.920]   You can actually just like lower yourself down
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:43.380]   on a rope to the ground and walk away,
[03:08:43.380 --> 03:08:45.100]   but then there's that stubbornness.
[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:46.580]   But I think that the stubbornness
[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:49.300]   has its evolutionary adaptations too.
[03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:51.680]   And the hero's journey, nothing in the hero's journey
[03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:54.120]   says that the transitions between these different states
[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:57.300]   are linear, are of equal duration,
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:01.900]   are of certainty, only that they exist
[03:09:01.900 --> 03:09:03.820]   and that there's no way, as you point out before,
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:05.220]   to skip steps.
[03:09:05.220 --> 03:09:06.420]   - You can't skip.
[03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:07.820]   I couldn't skip.
[03:09:07.820 --> 03:09:10.780]   If somebody skips, I mean, it's like you hit every branch.
[03:09:10.780 --> 03:09:11.900]   - No, but nobody skips.
[03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:13.860]   And whether or not somebody tries to skip
[03:09:13.860 --> 03:09:16.620]   through psychedelics or through being the toughest
[03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:19.180]   or through the acquisition of money
[03:09:19.180 --> 03:09:20.980]   or just focusing on family,
[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:22.420]   family obviously is super important,
[03:09:22.420 --> 03:09:23.980]   but that's not going to accomplish
[03:09:23.980 --> 03:09:26.240]   the other aspects of the journey.
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:27.140]   It's a huge part of it,
[03:09:27.140 --> 03:09:28.780]   but it's not the only part.
[03:09:28.780 --> 03:09:30.660]   Again, necessary, not sufficient.
[03:09:30.660 --> 03:09:33.460]   - Yeah, it's like, again, the 12 steps are some,
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:34.820]   I'm not that experienced in it.
[03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:37.100]   I just read about it a decent amount.
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:38.880]   It's like hitting every branch.
[03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:41.260]   Like you got to follow the steps, man.
[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:45.680]   Or you can live with that low grade pain nonstop.
[03:09:45.680 --> 03:09:49.500]   You know, it's not a good way to live.
[03:09:49.500 --> 03:09:51.900]   - No, because even if you're not conscious of it,
[03:09:51.900 --> 03:09:54.660]   it erodes you in ways that are very destructive.
[03:09:54.660 --> 03:09:56.260]   - I wasn't conscious of it at all,
[03:09:56.260 --> 03:09:58.780]   you know, until the universe, as we say,
[03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:01.420]   came in with a fucking wrecking ball
[03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:04.060]   and said, fine, you're not going to listen?
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:06.180]   Sent you all these messages, you're not going to listen?
[03:10:06.180 --> 03:10:07.020]   Okay.
[03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:12.500]   - I think it's important that we at least briefly touch
[03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:15.300]   on where things are at right now,
[03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:19.900]   because it would be remiss for us to give the impression
[03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:22.500]   that like you're sitting there meditating,
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:24.980]   you're drinking your coffee 90 minutes late,
[03:10:24.980 --> 03:10:27.940]   after you wake up, you're sitting there in bliss
[03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:29.380]   and thinking about all the great things that happened,
[03:10:29.380 --> 03:10:30.220]   how you made it through.
[03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:32.780]   Like, there's still a lot happening right now.
[03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:35.680]   So to the extent that you can share,
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:38.460]   you're working all the time.
[03:10:38.460 --> 03:10:40.900]   What are you doing nowadays as a vocation?
[03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:43.140]   - I was in private equity for a while before I met you,
[03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:44.340]   running a company for,
[03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:47.180]   companies for a really good friend of mine
[03:10:47.180 --> 03:10:49.160]   named Tom Ripley, amazing guy.
[03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:52.780]   And then I stepped away because I was exhausted
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:54.400]   and I didn't know how to say it.
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:55.660]   I didn't know how to tell anybody.
[03:10:55.660 --> 03:10:57.420]   Like I needed to escape again,
[03:10:57.420 --> 03:10:59.420]   take magic flight somehow, you know?
[03:10:59.420 --> 03:11:03.620]   And he and I are incredibly close.
[03:11:03.620 --> 03:11:04.700]   Like he was one of the guys
[03:11:04.700 --> 03:11:07.440]   who is in that super tight inner circle.
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:14.180]   And then I came back to it with this team that I'm on
[03:11:14.180 --> 03:11:18.820]   and I serve as the chief operating officer
[03:11:18.820 --> 03:11:19.780]   at Lid Sports Group,
[03:11:19.780 --> 03:11:22.500]   the largest brick and mortar licensed sports retailer
[03:11:23.900 --> 03:11:24.760]   in North America.
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:26.920]   We have 2000 stores during the holiday.
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:30.280]   We have 8,200 employees and amazing team.
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:32.560]   The private equity firm that I work for is an amazing team.
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:35.480]   And the company is an amazing company
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:38.720]   and just incredible group of folks.
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:42.100]   And so, yeah, I work a lot.
[03:11:42.100 --> 03:11:44.480]   I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and LA
[03:11:44.480 --> 03:11:45.600]   and that's, it's all good.
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:50.600]   And I think I do those little things
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:53.420]   all day long, all the time, but no,
[03:11:53.420 --> 03:11:55.280]   I am not sitting on a mountaintop.
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:58.000]   Like most days there's no meditation at all, Andrew.
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.120]   It's meditation as a workout.
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:02.440]   Tom and I throw kettlebells around multiple times a week
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:05.520]   and I do those other little things.
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:09.460]   But the difference for me is I'm okay with it.
[03:12:09.460 --> 03:12:14.320]   And I say that because I was incredibly busy, you know,
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:16.520]   before when I first got out of the Navy
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:21.400]   and I wasn't okay with it because I thought,
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:23.800]   again, this is back to the hero's journey.
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:27.040]   I thought like the return to ordinary life
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:28.720]   was going to be sunshine and rainbows.
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:32.080]   Like, look, I have the ultimate boon.
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:33.600]   I had this big experience.
[03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.900]   Not that I wanted to be like front and center in the media,
[03:12:35.900 --> 03:12:39.900]   but here I am world, it's calm out here, right?
[03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:43.720]   Like we get to chill and have a good time and sleep
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:47.320]   and nothing is stressful in the real world, right?
[03:12:47.320 --> 03:12:48.340]   Wrong.
[03:12:48.340 --> 03:12:49.520]   I just wasn't ready for that.
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:51.360]   Like I really genuinely thought
[03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:54.200]   that it was just going to be easier.
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:57.280]   And so when we talk about the low grade pain, Andrew,
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:59.180]   and like the, you know, what is that?
[03:12:59.180 --> 03:13:01.100]   To me, that was one of the biggest frictions.
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:02.720]   Like, holy shit.
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:05.600]   I did all this stuff, all these deployments,
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:09.760]   lost all these buddies and there's no fucking rest.
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:12.680]   Like the regular world, it's not,
[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:13.720]   it's supposed to be easier.
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:16.020]   At least that's the story that was in my mind.
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:19.600]   Going through all the stuff we just talked about,
[03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:21.660]   now I'm okay with it.
[03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:23.000]   Like, I like it.
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:24.300]   I know how to manage my life.
[03:13:24.300 --> 03:13:26.840]   I know how to manage my time for the most part.
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:29.560]   I have a different relationship with my teammates
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:33.560]   and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life.
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:35.880]   And I love it.
[03:13:35.880 --> 03:13:40.120]   Like, I feel like I'm back to, in a very different way,
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:43.680]   where I was when I was in the squadron back in '07.
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:45.080]   Like, I feel like I'm on,
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:47.200]   hope this doesn't get clipped,
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.080]   but for me, I'm on another level.
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:52.440]   Like, I really feel good about where I'm headed.
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:56.080]   And I haven't felt like that since I went into college.
[03:13:56.080 --> 03:13:59.680]   You know, I felt like shit was just deteriorating
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:02.340]   and now it's not, which is nice.
[03:14:02.340 --> 03:14:05.800]   - Well, the beauty of what you just said
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:08.160]   and everything you've shared today is that,
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:09.600]   I don't know if it occurs to you or not,
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:14.600]   but you've been providing mentorship to millions of people.
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:20.360]   To millions of people in the form of sharing your experience
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:23.180]   of your own hero's journey.
[03:14:23.180 --> 03:14:28.180]   And I want to thank you for making it so clear
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:32.720]   as to what your experience was and being unafraid
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:35.480]   or perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway,
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:38.680]   exactly what that felt like.
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:40.760]   Even better in that sense, you know,
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:42.580]   and stepping into that fear.
[03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:46.680]   But also making it so clear
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:51.680]   that while your life experience is, you know, extraordinary,
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.760]   SEAL teams, tier one teams, all in all, you know,
[03:14:55.760 --> 03:14:58.560]   all of it that, you know,
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:01.400]   everyone's life has these components of extraordinary
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:03.080]   and the opportunity for extraordinary
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:06.280]   and the return and renewal through the ordinary world.
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:10.080]   So much of what you shared has meaning,
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:13.480]   regardless of people are male, female, young, old,
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:17.880]   so thank you for being a mentor today
[03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:21.080]   and for having the bravery,
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:25.200]   for stepping out into the quote unquote ordinary world,
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:30.200]   which is oh so unordinary and if you're willing,
[03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:33.560]   I think it'd be great to have you back
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:36.720]   in maybe a couple of years and see where you're at.
[03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:39.440]   Meanwhile, you and I will be in touch often
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:42.680]   as we frequently are, so.
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:43.720]   - Thanks Andrew, appreciate it.
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:45.880]   - Coleman Ruiz, thanks for everything you've done.
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:46.720]   - Thank you.
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:48.320]   - Thanks for everything you're doing
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:51.280]   and thanks for coming out today
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:55.400]   and sharing with us what real life's about.
[03:15:55.400 --> 03:15:58.000]   - It's always great to see you, appreciate the time.
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:15:59.440]   It was a joy, thanks.
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:00.960]   - Likewise.
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:01.800]   Thank you for joining me

[03:16:35.400 --> 03:16:37.280]   Not so much during today's episode,
[03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:39.880]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:41.380]   we discuss supplements.
[03:16:41.380 --> 03:16:43.480]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:45.460]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:46.720]   for things like improving sleep,
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:48.440]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:49.640]   To learn more about the supplements
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:51.180]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:16:51.180 --> 03:16:54.600]   please go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:56.920]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:16:56.920 --> 03:16:59.960]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:03.340]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:05.080]   And on all those platforms,
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:06.720]   I share science and science-related tools,
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:08.160]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.640]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:11.680]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:12.960]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:16.380]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:27.740]   as well as protocols in the form of one- to three-page PDFs,
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:30.060]   protocols on things like deliberate cold exposure,
[03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:32.480]   or optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:34.060]   neuroplasticity and learning.
[03:17:34.060 --> 03:17:36.080]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:39.160]   that details cardiovascular and resistance training workouts,
[03:17:39.160 --> 03:17:41.700]   and all of that is available to you completely zero cost.

[03:17:47.440 --> 03:17:49.880]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:51.280]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:53.680]   for today's discussion with Coleman Ruiz.
[03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:56.060]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:17:56.060 --> 03:17:58.000]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.580]   [upbeat music]
[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:03.160]   (upbeat music)
