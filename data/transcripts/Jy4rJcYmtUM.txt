[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.140]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.280]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.580]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.780]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.860]   Today marks the sixth episode in our six episode series
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.860]   all about sleep with expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.660]   Today's episode focuses on sleep and dreaming
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.400]   as well as lucid dreaming.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.980]   We talk about what's happening in your brain when you dream,
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.060]   both mundane dreams as well as
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.860]   heavily emotionally laden dreams,
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.300]   and we discuss how to think about
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.480]   and perhaps even interpret the content of your dreams.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.780]   And we talk about lucid dreaming,
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.400]   which are dreams that occur while in sleep, of course,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.860]   in which you are aware that you are dreaming.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.460]   And because unfortunately they are relatively common,
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.300]   we also talk about nightmares
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.220]   and both what to do about nightmares
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.540]   as well as how to think about nightmares.
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.700]   This being the final episode
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.920]   in the six episode series all about sleep,
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.420]   I put the call out on my social media handles
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.740]   for any and all questions about sleep
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.740]   that I could direct to Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.260]   So as today's episode closes, I ask him those questions,
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.140]   focusing specifically on the questions
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980]   that were most frequently asked by you, the audience,
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.620]   and he answers them in rapid succession.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.260]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.960]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.700]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.400]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.220]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.420]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.100]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.660]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.260]   I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.340]   Initially, I had to do therapy against my will,
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.460]   but of course, I continued to do it voluntarily over time
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.940]   because I really believe that doing regular therapy
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.360]   with a quality therapist is one of the best things
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.060]   that we can do for our mental health.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.960]   Indeed, for many people, it's as beneficial
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.740]   as getting regular physical exercise.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.900]   The great thing about BetterHelp
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.180]   is that it makes it very easy to find a therapist
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.060]   that's optimal for your needs.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.980]   And I think it's fair to say
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.660]   that we can define a great therapist
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.460]   as somebody with whom you have excellent rapport,
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.380]   somebody with whom you can talk about
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.660]   a variety of different issues,
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.460]   and who can provide you not just support, but also insight.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.620]   And with BetterHelp, they make it extremely convenient
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.300]   so that it's matched to your schedule
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.860]   and other aspects of your life.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.420]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.340]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.140]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.340]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.020]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.420]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.500]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.060]   That means plenty of the electrolytes,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.980]   magnesium, potassium, and sodium, and no sugar.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980]   As I mentioned before on this podcast,
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.340]   I'm a big fan of salt.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.180]   Now, I wanna be clear.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.460]   People who already consume a lot of salt,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.420]   or who have high blood pressure,
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.740]   or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.300]   that typically contain salt
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.880]   need to control their salt intake.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.740]   However, if you're somebody who eats pretty clean
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.180]   and you're somebody who exercises
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.740]   and you're drinking a lot of water,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.620]   there's a decent chance that you could benefit
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.260]   from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.500]   The reason for that is that all the cells in our body,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.260]   including the nerve cells, the neurons,
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.140]   require the electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.500]   So we don't just wanna be hydrated.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.420]   We want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.380]   With Element, that's very easy to do.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.860]   What I do is when I wake up in the morning,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.220]   I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.080]   and I'll dissolve a packet of Element in that water.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.140]   I'll also do the same when I exercise,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.580]   especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.820]   And sometimes I'll even have a third Element packet
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.500]   dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.580]   or sweating a lot,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.340]   or if I just noticed that I'm not consuming
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.660]   enough salt with my food.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.860]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.260]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.460]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.360]   Again, that's drinkelement, L-M-N-T.com/huberman.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.220]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.960]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.040]   It's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.540]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.200]   When we're getting enough quality sleep,
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.760]   everything in life goes so much better,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.920]   and when we are not getting enough quality sleep,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.320]   everything in life is that much more challenging.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.520]   And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.480]   is to have the appropriate mattress.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.440]   Everyone, however, has slightly different needs
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.220]   in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.860]   Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs,
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.000]   and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.440]   that asks you questions like, do you sleep on your back,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.360]   your side, or your stomach?
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.080]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.280]   Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.160]   If you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.640]   they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.600]   For me, it turned out to be the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.020]   It's not too hard, not too soft,
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.340]   and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.840]   than on any other type of mattress I've used before.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.020]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.820]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.520]   take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.560]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.360]   and for this month only, May 2024,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.840]   you can get up to 30% off all mattresses
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.240]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.400]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   to get 30% off and two free pillows.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.860]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.420]   Dr. Walker.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.380]   - My dear good fellow, Dr. Huberman.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.480]   - Today is the sixth and final episode
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.400]   in the six-episode series
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.760]   that we've been recording on sleep.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.280]   During episode one, you told us about the biology of sleep
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.720]   and some actionable items to get the basics of sleep
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.600]   well worked out for each of us.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.900]   And it's highly particular to our individual needs.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.840]   And you explained how to define those needs.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.220]   Then you beautifully described in-depth protocols
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.580]   for let's call it optimizing one's sleep.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.000]   And then a third episode focused on caffeine,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.040]   napping, and also food intake and its impact on sleep.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.560]   We talked about the relationship between sleep
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.880]   and learning and memory and creativity.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.520]   And then of course, in the fifth episode,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.080]   just prior to this one,
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.760]   you beautifully described the literature
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.940]   and actionable tools for connecting sleep
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.240]   to emotional health and mental health,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.680]   as well as the relationship between lack of sleep
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.000]   and certain mental health challenges or conditions.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.080]   Today, we are going to dive into a truly exciting
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.280]   and fascinating topic, which is dreaming.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.000]   I can think of fewer topics more intriguing than dreams.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.360]   I know there's a lot of interest in lucid dreaming.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.800]   That is one dreaming while being aware that one is dreaming.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.420]   You'll tell us more about that.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.880]   But I think dreams just intrigue and fascinate us
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.360]   for so many reasons, but not the least of which is that
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.480]   at some point we all seem to have them
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.180]   and they seem to have a relevance for our lives.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.040]   They're not just epiphenomena, as we say.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.560]   So today, I know you're going to explain
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.900]   what they do and do not provide for us.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.680]   And I'm really excited to dive into this topic
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.560]   'cause it's something that I've been fascinated by.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.640]   And I know many people are fascinated by.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   So just to kick things off, how do we define dreaming?
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.240]   What is a dream?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.420]   What is a dream state?
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.480]   - You would think it's fairly simple
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.220]   because when people say,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.280]   oh, I had the strangest dream last night,
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.200]   everyone seems to know what's a dream.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.060]   And by the way, dreaming is, we take it for granted.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.580]   We say, oh, I had a strange dream last night.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.260]   Just think about it though.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.340]   Last night, both you and I and everyone listening,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.340]   as long as they slept, we all became flagrantly psychotic.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.540]   Now, before you reject my diagnosis
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.100]   of your nightly psychosis, I'll give you five good reasons.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.240]   First, when we start to dream,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.260]   we see things which are not there.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.020]   So we hallucinate.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.980]   Second, we believe things that could not possibly be true.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.580]   So we're delusional.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.200]   Third, we get confused about time, place, and person.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.100]   So we're suffering from disorientation.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.820]   Fourth, we have these wildly fluctuating emotions,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.680]   something that psychiatrists call being affectively labile.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.780]   And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.740]   and you forgot most, if not all of that dream experience.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.740]   So you are suffering from amnesia.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.140]   If you were to experience any one of those five symptoms
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.140]   while you're awake, we'd probably be seeking
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.040]   psychological or psychiatric treatment.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.220]   But for reasons that we still don't fully understand,
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.860]   that seems to be a normal biological and psychological,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.560]   and in fact, and I'll describe the data,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.140]   absolutely necessary life support,
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.600]   perhaps necessary set of experiences to go through.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.260]   So that's the peculiarity of dreaming,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.660]   but how do we define it?
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.100]   One of the loose definitions
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.340]   that we often use in sleep science
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.060]   is that a dream is any report
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.940]   of mental activity upon awakening.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.380]   So I'll come into the laboratory and I'll wake you up
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.060]   and I'll say, what was going through your mind?
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.420]   And if you just say, nothing really,
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.740]   then we note that down as no dream report.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.220]   But if you were to say, well, you know what?
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.380]   I was actually just thinking about the next time
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.340]   you're going to come in and wake me up,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.380]   then we would report that as a dream.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.220]   But that's not really what most people mean
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.440]   when they say I had this strange dream.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.240]   What they're referring to is dreaming that takes place
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.740]   during the stage of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.580]   or REM sleep.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.980]   And during REM sleep,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.140]   there we have these bizarre hallucinogenic,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.420]   these vivid, these narrative,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.660]   these emotion filled story experiences.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.120]   Those are the types of reports
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.300]   that we get principally from REM sleep.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.140]   So if I were to go back to episode one and say,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.180]   think about those different stages of sleep,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.140]   light non-REM sleep, deep non-REM sleep,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.460]   and REM sleep, when does dreaming occur?
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.460]   Well, if I wake you up during stage two non-REM sleep,
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.500]   that's one of the lighter forms of non-REM,
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.100]   early in the night, but especially later in the night,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.860]   you typically will report a dream,
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.260]   maybe about 50% probability.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.500]   50% of the time I wake you up out of that stage,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.100]   no report, the other half, yes.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.620]   If I wake you up to deep non-REM sleep,
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.820]   stages three and four, we're down to a zero to 20% chance
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.540]   that you'll report a dream.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.860]   So very, very unlikely.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.680]   If I wake you up out of REM sleep,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.340]   somewhere between 80 to 90% probability
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.300]   that you were going to report a dream.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.240]   There's nuance in that REM sleep story, by the way.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.580]   Rapid eye movement sleep
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.280]   is defined by those rapid eye movements.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.820]   But when you're in that stage of sleep,
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.980]   you're not always having the eye movements.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.820]   They come in these strange phases.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.740]   So you will be in REM sleep,
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.380]   and we can define that with lots of different sensors
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.120]   on your brain and your body.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.180]   But then there will be times
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.220]   when your eyes are darting back and forth,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.620]   and times when your eyes are not.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.160]   And when those eyes are moving during REM sleep,
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.460]   we call that phasic REM sleep.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.580]   And when they're not, we call it tonic REM sleep.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.460]   Don't worry about the terminology.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.300]   When I wake you up out of tonic REM sleep
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.420]   when the eyes aren't moving,
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.100]   I'm around that 80% probability.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.940]   If I wake you up out of REM sleep
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.580]   when your eyes are darting back and forth,
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.300]   there is 95 to 100% probability
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.900]   that you're going to report a dream.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.840]   Some people, theories in the past have said,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.980]   well, if that's the case,
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.500]   then presumably those eye movements
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.740]   are tracking something in the dream.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.660]   If you do careful analyses,
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.700]   that just does not seem to hold up.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.940]   There is some evidence that that may be the case,
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.700]   but your eyes are moving back and forth.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.260]   It seems that these are impulses
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.300]   that are going to your eyes
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.180]   that don't have a strong correlation
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.620]   with what it is that you're dreaming visually in the scene.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.820]   That's not the case.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.580]   But that's a little bit of a definition of what dreaming is
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.540]   and also when dreaming occurs.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.580]   I should probably note by the way that we human beings,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.500]   we seem to be special in our REM sleep dreaming amounts.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.460]   Now, I've just done a little bit of a sleight of hand.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.580]   When I say REM sleep,
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.560]   I'm going to infer that it's a dreaming.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   But Charles Nunn, wonderful scientist,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.540]   has looked at the proportion of REM sleep
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.940]   across different mammals.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.100]   And what he found was that we human beings
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.300]   are a complete anomaly
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.220]   when it comes to our relative amounts of REM sleep.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.220]   In other words, our dream sleep.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.100]   He found that across most other primates,
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.260]   REM sleep was usually averaging
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.860]   about 9% of the sleep period.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.380]   However, we human beings on average,
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.800]   including when we're young,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.280]   we'll have a REM sleep proportion of about 20%.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.920]   So if you plot the amount of REM sleep of primates
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.880]   in a graph, they're all sort of clustered around this mean.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.680]   And then all of a sudden on the far right-hand side,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.360]   you've got this one single data point that sticks out.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.880]   That's us, human beings.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   And we don't fully understand why it is
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.800]   that we have such exceptional amounts of REM sleep.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.720]   Now, I've done a lot of hand-waving
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.760]   and written some theories about why that is,
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.300]   but it's still very unclear.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.400]   The other thing, and that's a very,
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.520]   I can go very philosophical about the functions
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.100]   of REM sleep and how it changed
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.720]   as we made the transition as a species from tree to ground.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.600]   Because don't forget,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.560]   as we mentioned in one of our episodes,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.280]   when you're hanging like a bird on a tree
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   or you're resting on a branch as a primate up in the trees
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.820]   and you go into REM sleep, you lose muscle tone.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.460]   So it's quite a fragile state
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.220]   when you're 30 foot up in the air
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.700]   and you've got gravity desperately wanting
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.160]   to bring you and your limbs down to the ground.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.220]   But when we made the transition down from tree to ground,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.700]   we no longer had to worry about that.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.800]   Did that open up the opportunity
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.020]   for more REM sleep to occur?
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.340]   And that explains why we human beings have that.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.180]   We don't know.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.820]   REM sleep, however, does seem to be quite fundamental
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.220]   and fundamental from a life necessary perspective.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.940]   There were some studies done back in the 1980s
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.420]   and there are studies that have not really been replicated.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.660]   And I think I agree as to why,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.100]   because ethically, you don't,
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.940]   they're right in that gray zone.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.260]   In fact, for me, I find them quite uncomfortable
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.140]   when I speak about them or even teach them in class.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.260]   They took rats and they deprive them of sleep totally.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.060]   And what they found was that rats on average
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.060]   will die somewhere between about 13 to 17 days
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.400]   after total sleep deprivation.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.380]   In other words, rats will die almost as quickly
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.340]   from sleep deprivation as they will from food deprivation.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.620]   It's that essential.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.540]   - Brutal.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.440]   - But then they did something different.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.140]   They said, well, what about the different stages of sleep?
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.820]   So they selectively deprive them
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.660]   of either non-REM sleep and REM sleep.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.980]   The hypothesis was perhaps that non-REM sleep
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.540]   is from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.500]   a much older form of sleep.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.700]   The first stage of sleep that came into being
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.740]   was non-REM sleep.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.140]   And the way we answer that is we look across phylogeny
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.660]   and these sort of different branches.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.460]   And what we find is that in insects and in reptiles,
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.460]   amphibians and fish, they all seem to have non-REM sleep.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.380]   But for the most part, with a few exceptions,
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.300]   they don't seem to have REM sleep.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.620]   But if you look at birds and mammals,
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.500]   they do have REM sleep.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.340]   And in fact, it seems as though REM sleep
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.460]   evolved twice independently, once in birds,
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.420]   once in mammals, which tells us probably
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.660]   that it's essential if it's being forced
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.160]   through the evolutionary pipe twice independently.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.980]   So you would argue, well, if I selectively deprived you
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.220]   of non-REM, the older stage of sleep,
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.140]   presumably that's more life support necessary,
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.540]   and REM sleep, REM sleep is the new kid on the block,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.300]   evolutionarily, they found the opposite.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.300]   They found that if they selectively deprive rats
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.980]   just of non-REM sleep, they did die,
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.860]   but it took them longer.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.060]   They died after about 60 days.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.300]   If you deprive them of REM sleep, dream sleep,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.940]   they died after 40 days versus 60 days.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.180]   The words, this new type of sleep, REM sleep,
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.700]   seems to be on that basis, maybe even more important
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.340]   to supporting life than non-REM sleep.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.300]   - It's super interesting.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.980]   And as I recall from graduate school,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.940]   there are certain patterns of brain activity
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.700]   that occur during a rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.020]   Maybe we could go a little bit deeper
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.540]   into those patterns of activity.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.200]   I know you touched on some of these patterns
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.060]   in the first episode.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.780]   The thing that comes to mind here is PGO waves,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.020]   pons, geniculate, occipital,
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.540]   pons being an area of the brainstem
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.420]   that is chock-a-block full of different neurons
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.820]   involved in basic functions, rhythmic breathing,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.980]   eye movements, and basic reflexive functions
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.540]   that preserve the well-being and life of the animal.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.580]   And that the neurons there then do indeed connect
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.540]   to the thalamus, this is like a shape structure
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.380]   in the middle of the brain
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.600]   where you have something called the geniculate,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.960]   which is a, there's an auditory geniculate
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.920]   and a visual geniculate,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.480]   but that projects to this relay station
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.600]   for vision mainly and hearing.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.840]   And then it goes up to the occipital lobe,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.360]   the area in the back of our brain that incited people
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.160]   as responsible for conscious perception of images.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.320]   And I was taught, and I don't know if this is still true,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.260]   that based on the work of people like Merce Steriad
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.460]   and folks like that,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.420]   that these pons, geniculate, occipital waves of activity
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.140]   that were ongoing during sleep, I think during REM sleep,
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.780]   were essential for resetting something essential
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.260]   about brain function and wakefulness
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.100]   so that you needed these PGO waves.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.620]   And that maybe even the activation of the visual pathway
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.940]   was part of the reasons why we often experience
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.000]   such robust visual hallucinations during dreams.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   What is thought about PGO waves?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   Are they related to rapid eye movement sleep?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   And are they somehow the reset that we need,
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.380]   and indeed is essential for life?
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.200]   Because as you pointed out,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.860]   in the absence of rapid eye movement sleep, we die.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   - It's a great demonstration of the uniqueness
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.640]   of your brain.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.880]   I mean, essentially what we're asking is,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.960]   this is your brain on dreams, explain.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   And REM sleep has many different brain features to it.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.600]   The first of which is, as we spoke in the first episode,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.360]   your electrical brainwave activity at the top of the brain,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.480]   the cortex, looks almost identical to that
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.560]   which you have when you're awake, which is stunning,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.800]   because you're not conscious.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.480]   You're lying completely still,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.960]   no presence of muscle tone whatsoever,
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.080]   yet your brain seems to be just as on fire
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.980]   with electrical activity as it is when you're awake.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.800]   Coming down a step though,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.480]   there are these unique pulses of electrical,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.400]   almost like lightning bursts
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.160]   that come up from the brainstem
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.120]   up to this sensory relay center in your brain
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.240]   called the thalamus.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.320]   And then they were initially recorded
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.960]   out in the back of the brain in the visual cortex.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.740]   Hence this PGO waves describes the three sites
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.920]   that I've just mentioned,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   goes from the brainstem, the pons up to the thalamus,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.480]   a part of it called the geniculate,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.000]   and then out to the back of the brain
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.280]   called the occipital cortex, PGO.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:36.220]   What they found was that those bursts of PGO wave activity
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.680]   were very much linked to these rapid eye movements.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   So once you got this burst of a PGO wave,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.820]   this sort of brainstem up into the brain burst,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.820]   then you got one of these rapid eye movements.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.240]   So it was linking something there with the eye movements.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.400]   And I told you that when you're having these eye movements,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.120]   that's a state where there's a high probability of dreaming.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.800]   And is it a surprise then that the final destination
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.380]   of that lightning bolt where it sort of strikes
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.920]   is at the back of the brain in the visual cortex?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.800]   Probably not.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.320]   There's also been some links
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.440]   with those PGO waves and learning.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.920]   Not so much that those PGO waves
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.000]   seem to consolidate memories.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.520]   In other words, they may not be critical
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.200]   for sleep after learning,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.600]   but they seem to be related almost to sleep
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.520]   and initial learning.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.020]   And the more that animals learn,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.640]   the greater the amount of PGO wave activity they have
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.860]   when they go to sleep.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.660]   So PGO waves are unique.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.400]   PGO waves don't simply just hit the back of your brain
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.480]   that we've now measured them
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.880]   in all sorts of different cortical areas.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.920]   And they seem to light up the lightning splits as it were,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.520]   and it strikes all sorts of cortical areas.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.000]   So then the question was, well, let's take humans
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.600]   and let's put them inside of brain scanners.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.400]   Let's allow them to fall into REM sleep,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   and then we'll start scanning the brain.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.960]   What did we find?
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.120]   It was very interesting.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.300]   When you look at the brain during REM sleep
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.680]   compared to, let's say, non-REM sleep,
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.480]   you see motor regions of the brain lighting up.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.120]   You see visual regions of the brain lighting up,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.380]   just as we described.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.320]   You see memory-related structures lighting up,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.680]   like the hippocampus,
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.420]   and you see emotional-related structures,
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:34.080]   like the amygdala and something called the anterior cortex,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.480]   the anterior cingulate cortex, I should say.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.360]   So if I were to just show you an expert,
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   a brain imaging map with memory centers related
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.600]   in terms of their activity,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.440]   emotion centers, visual centers, motoric centers,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.280]   and I were to say to you,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.360]   "Andrew, this is a scan that we got from an individual.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.860]   "Just describe the type of experience
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.320]   "that you think this person was having in the scanner."
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.440]   You would probably look at it and say,
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.160]   "Well, they were probably recollecting things
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.360]   "from their past, memory structures.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.000]   "They seemed to be having a visual experience,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.860]   "but there was also probably movement involved
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.300]   "in that brain scanning experiment,
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.200]   "and also there seems to be
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.460]   "some degree of emotionality to it."
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.600]   That sounds strikingly similar
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.560]   to what we know dreams are like,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.400]   with one exception, though.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.220]   Another part of the brain bucked the trend
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.880]   of increased activation during REM sleep.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.120]   That part of the brain
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.500]   were the far left and right sides of your frontal lobe,
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.300]   something that we call the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.680]   terrible mouthful word salad.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.480]   Essentially, it just means the far left and right sides
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.060]   of your prefrontal cortex.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.080]   Those are very important for logical,
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.040]   rational thinking and decision-making.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.920]   Those parts of the brain went down in their activity,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.800]   almost as though they were suppressed
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.400]   during REM sleep dreaming.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.680]   So now let's go back to our map.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.280]   You're having a visual experience.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.880]   It's filled with movement and memories and emotions,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.760]   but it's utterly bizarre,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.360]   completely illogical, and totally irrational.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.380]   If that's not a perfect neural definition
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.600]   of this thing called dreaming, I don't know what is.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.440]   - It's so interesting.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.160]   We think of dreams, or at least I think of dreams
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   as a fragmented representation of real-world experiences
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.940]   from our recent past, maybe even the previous day,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.760]   sort of meshed with our distant past experience.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.320]   And then, of course,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.280]   our brain is also a very good anticipatory machine,
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.880]   and somehow puts that into a movie that,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.780]   for all purposes, when we're in it,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.240]   we feel as if it's happening in real time.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   And then, of course, we try and untangle
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.840]   what the meaning of all that is.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.320]   I think people are really intrigued by dreams
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.280]   because they just feel so real to us,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.800]   and yet we know they're not of the same real
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.760]   that is our waking experience.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.120]   And, you know, throughout history,
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.600]   people have alluded to the idea
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.720]   or have been convinced of the idea
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.160]   that dreams are meaningful
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.840]   and something we're going to get into.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.000]   - And I should mention, by the way,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.120]   that your dreams based on those brain scans
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.600]   still remained your own.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.280]   You were the only person privy
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.360]   to the experience of the dream itself.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.520]   I could stick you in a scanner and I could say,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.080]   you know, were you having a visual dream?
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.760]   And was it, you know, filled with motor activity
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.520]   and emotions and memories?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.840]   That tells me how you're dreaming.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.540]   It doesn't tell me what you're dreaming.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.100]   So at that point, you still had this degree
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.520]   of security and privacy.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.780]   No longer, it seems.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.240]   There was a great study done by a Japanese group
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.140]   using very advanced brain imaging technology
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.980]   and techniques such as multi-voxel pattern analysis,
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.260]   again, word salad, but it's a very clever technique.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.780]   And they were able to start to understand
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.860]   exactly what you, Andrew Huberman, were dreaming.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.220]   And they would know what you were dreaming
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.460]   even before you woke up and told us what you were dreaming.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.140]   And they did a two-part experiment.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.660]   First, they showed you lots of very specific images,
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.660]   images of cars, of women, of houses,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.540]   of men, of dogs, of cats,
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.740]   of just a whole category of different visual elements.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.580]   And your brain was being scanned
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.020]   as you were awake watching each of these.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.940]   And then using this clever analysis,
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.180]   they were able to build up this very specific pattern,
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.260]   this very specific template of activity
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.100]   that for you, Andrew Huberman,
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.100]   said he is now looking specifically at a set of keys,
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.820]   or he was looking at a car,
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.820]   or he was looking at a woman, or a man, or a house.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.300]   And we knew ground truth
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.740]   in terms of what your brain looks like
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.940]   when it is seeing these different categories.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.140]   And then they did something clever.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.940]   Then they let those individuals sleep and go into REM sleep.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.500]   And then they started waking them up
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.620]   and getting dream reports.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.860]   But once they got the dream reports,
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.780]   the analysis sort of team remained blind to those reports.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.460]   What they did was almost like a forensic team
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.100]   that goes hunting for DNA at a crime scene.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.780]   They had the DNA and they started going around
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.860]   and searching to see if they could find a DNA match.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.100]   But here, they weren't using the DNA.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.700]   They were using these templates of a woman's face,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.740]   or a car, or a house.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.340]   And they would search through this electrical,
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.980]   this brain activity,
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.940]   sort of static of your dreams at night,
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.860]   and find these matches.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.340]   And then we could wake you up, get the dream report,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.060]   and see how well did our brain performing
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.660]   a sort of algorithm match
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.700]   with your actual subjective report when you came out.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.820]   And it was stunning how close.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.540]   So I could tell you were dreaming,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:31.540]   but you were also dreaming about a house and a car.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.980]   You're dreaming about a woman, it turns out.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.980]   And we started to, once your dreams, as I said,
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.820]   were your own, but now no longer,
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.420]   because science can start to reveal those.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   What we can't yet do is understand which specific woman
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.060]   in which specific house.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.580]   So what you would probably see in my brain
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.900]   based on my own proclivities lighting up
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.620]   is it would just be full of cars, probably, sports cars,
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.260]   and then maybe another special individual woman.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.460]   Those two things would be dominant,
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.740]   but you wouldn't know that I'm dreaming
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.740]   about the new Porsche 911 GT2 RS.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.820]   You can't tell it.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.700]   You can just simply tell me he was dreaming about a car.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.700]   So there is still some distance to go.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.340]   - I can't help but ask, based on what you just described,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.380]   when people say things in their dreams,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.340]   when they sleep talk,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.900]   how faithfully does that report what's in the dream?
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.980]   - It doesn't at all.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.220]   And the reason is because when you're sleep talking
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.380]   or sleep walking, or even sleep eating,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.780]   you're not dreaming because you're not in dream sleep.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.660]   This is one of the fallacies
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.900]   that sleep walking or sleep talking,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.620]   you're, you know, stop dreaming, wake up, you're dreaming.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   You're waking someone out of the very depths
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.460]   of deep non-REM sleep.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.100]   And these different things, sleep walking, sleep talking,
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.180]   sleep eating, sleep,
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.140]   there's sleep associated sex behavior.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.860]   All of these things are what we call parasomnias.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.540]   Para meaning sort of around, somnia, obviously sleep.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.860]   So these are things that happen around sleep,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.900]   but they're not quite in sleep.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.060]   Because when you have those,
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.940]   you are launched from deep non-REM sleep up to wakefulness,
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.220]   but you don't make it all the way to wakefulness.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.540]   And so you act out these very rote,
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.340]   routine, reflexive behaviors.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.100]   You just repeat certain words,
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.580]   you lift a cup to your mouth, go up to the refrigerator.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.820]   So they are not faithful to the dream,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.340]   because if I were to gently wake you
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.620]   as you're sleep talking and say
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.420]   what was going through your head,
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.300]   you'll say nothing at all.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.180]   And you don't report a dream.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.460]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.820]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.340]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.980]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.620]   and is designed to meet all
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.580]   of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.700]   By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.940]   that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.740]   And indeed, that is true.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.020]   Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.860]   I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.740]   or minimally processed sources.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.220]   However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.940]   of fruits and vegetables each day.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.300]   So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.660]   of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.020]   and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.380]   And of course, I still make sure
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.660]   to eat fruits and vegetables.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.980]   And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.580]   that I'm getting enough of what I need.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.020]   In addition, the adaptogens and other micronutrients
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.620]   in AG1 really help buffer against stress
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.780]   and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.180]   of my body are getting the things they need.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.860]   People often ask me that if they were gonna take
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.180]   just one supplement, what that supplement should be.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.300]   And I always answer AG1.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.860]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.780]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.860]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.940]   Earlier in the series, you described beautiful experiments
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.980]   by Matt Wilson and others at MIT
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.260]   who explored neural activity within the brain,
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.860]   within the hippocampus in particular,
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.100]   an area associated with memory formation,
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:24.220]   in which the neurons in the hippocampus fire
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.020]   in the same sequence as they did
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.920]   during a particular daytime activity
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.620]   that preceded that night's sleep.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.700]   But they do so at a much more rapid rate.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.540]   Sometimes they play in reverse, et cetera.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.700]   This raises the question of, first of all,
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.900]   is that sort of neural replay of events from the prior day,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.740]   is that also associated with dreaming
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.020]   or more specifically, is that dreaming or is dreaming that?
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.340]   And that's really to raise the larger question,
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.500]   which is what is dreaming for?
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.540]   What is the function of dreaming?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.180]   - So what we know is that Matt Wilson's data
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.700]   during non-rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.100]   the brain was replaying those memories
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.740]   10 to 20 times faster.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.540]   So (imitates rapid eye movement)
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.100]   But when you go into REM sleep, it's down to 0.5 times.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.540]   So listening to this podcast now
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.700]   and you hit that speed button and you drop it down to 0.5,
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.040]   that seems to be the replay speed during REM sleep.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.460]   We've not yet been able to confirm that in human beings,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.400]   but if we did, does that mean we can explain
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.980]   the time differences that seem to happen in the dream state,
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.220]   that time is longer in the dream world
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.700]   than it is in the waking world?
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.220]   I think that's fascinating.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.580]   But you're right, it does point us more
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.780]   towards the question though,
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.700]   of what are the functions of this state called dreaming?
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.060]   And we can get onto whether or not dreaming
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   is a very faithful recapitulation of our waking experiences.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.640]   And I'll give you a spoiler now, no,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.220]   but I'll give you the data in a second.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.540]   But the functions of dreaming come back
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.640]   to some of the functions of REM sleep
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.500]   that we described in an earlier episode.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.940]   Those two related functions
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.180]   in the episode on learning and memory
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.060]   was that one function of REM sleep seems to be creativity,
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.940]   associating memories together
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.620]   so that you can come up with these
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.480]   wonderfully divine solutions
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.160]   to problems you couldn't answer when you're awake.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.040]   The second came in our last episode
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.680]   about emotional and mental wellness.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.440]   And we spoke about this theory that we put forward
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.580]   that REM sleep is a form of overnight therapy.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.280]   And we described the evidence supporting that therapy.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.360]   So I would say that those are the two leading theories
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.760]   of REM sleep and associated dreaming.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.620]   But I perhaps didn't give you the full story there.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.820]   There is a twist in both of those stories.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.620]   I told you that when you are in REM sleep
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.380]   and you're dreaming, the next day you are better able
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.220]   to assimilate and associate memories
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.060]   and come up with these creative insight solutions.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.260]   It turns out that sleep is necessary for that.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.340]   And not just sleep, but dream-related sleep,
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.920]   REM sleep is necessary for that, but it's not sufficient.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.720]   You not only have to be asleep
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.480]   and dreaming to get those benefits,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   you also have to be dreaming of the very things
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.020]   that you are trying to solve the next day.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.840]   There's a great study by a scientist
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   called Robert Stickgold at Harvard.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.880]   And he had a whole group of individuals
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.680]   learn a virtual maze.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.720]   And they were dropped down in different locations
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.280]   of the maze, and they had to try to get out of the maze.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.020]   And gradually, when you're dropped down
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.580]   in different locations, you do that enough times,
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.660]   you start to build up this mental map of the maze.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.380]   And then he let one half of those participants
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.300]   take a 90-minute nap, and the other half remained awake.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.700]   And then some hours later, they tested them on the maze,
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.040]   and they measured how quickly were you able
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.580]   to navigate and get out of the maze.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.260]   That was the outcome measure.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.380]   And sure enough, just as we described,
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.360]   those people who slept versus those who didn't,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.640]   they were better able to navigate the maze
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.160]   after they had slept versus those who remained awake.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.280]   But then they went back and they separated
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.900]   those individuals who were napping into two classes,
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.680]   because as they were napping,
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.120]   they were waking them up intermittently
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.960]   and getting dream reports from them.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.480]   And what they found was that those people who slept
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.820]   and still had dream reports,
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.680]   but those dreams were not related to the maze,
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.220]   they didn't show an improvement.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.980]   But those individuals who slept and who dreamt,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.140]   but also dreamt of the specific maze elements themselves,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.580]   they were the only subset of people,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.620]   of participants, who showed the benefit.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.400]   And that's a beautiful demonstration that,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.900]   yes, you need to sleep to get creative benefits,
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.040]   and in fact, seemingly have dream sleep,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.540]   but you also need to be dreaming about specific things.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.640]   Is that rule true for the second function
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.080]   of REM sleep dreaming, this overnight therapy benefit?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.000]   Yes, it does seem to be true.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.280]   There were some great studies by a scientist
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.480]   who has sadly passed away now, Rosalind Cartwright.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   And she was looking at different patient populations
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.520]   who had undergone really painful,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.560]   difficult emotional experiences.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.160]   For example, a very bitter, painful divorce.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.760]   And she would, at the time that those individuals
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.400]   were going through this difficult challenge,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.920]   she would be recording their sleep,
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.080]   looking at their different stages of sleep,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.680]   and she was collecting dream reports from them.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.560]   And then she would track them
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.680]   and their progression clinically over the next year.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.400]   And what she found was that some of those participants,
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.840]   about 50% of them, ended up getting clinical remission
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.440]   from their depression that was instigated
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.240]   by the painful experience they'd gone through.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.280]   The other half did not get clinical remission
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.720]   from their depression, they remained depressed.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.200]   And then she used those two classes to go back
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   and have a look at the sleep and the dream reports.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.000]   And what she found was some differences in REM sleep,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.640]   but more interestingly, were the differences in their dreams.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.200]   Both of those sets of individuals were dreaming
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.680]   at the time of going through
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.160]   those difficult emotional experiences.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.080]   Some of them, however, were dreaming
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.920]   of that challenging experience, others were not.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.720]   Those who dreamt, but also dreamt
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.280]   of the problematic experience,
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   were the ones who went on to get clinical resolution
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.400]   from their depression.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.200]   Those who dreamt, but did not dream of those events,
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.720]   seem to be the ones who did not get clinical remission
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.920]   from their depression.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.840]   In other words, here, once again, is this new rule,
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.320]   that when it comes to dreaming, it's not just about sleep,
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.920]   and it's not just about dreaming,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.560]   it's about dreaming of the specific things
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.400]   that you're trying to get the functional benefit from,
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.560]   whether that's creativity and insight,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.480]   or whether it's emotional resolution and overnight therapy,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.040]   both of them seem to depend very much
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   on the expression of dreaming of specific things itself.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.800]   And we'll come on to why that's maybe relevant
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.120]   when we speak about lucidity, too.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.520]   - What you just said is very reassuring, at least to me,
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.600]   because when I'm going through a challenging phase,
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.360]   which somehow seems to happen periodically in my life
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.400]   at a frequency that, let's just say,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.680]   keeps me dreaming about things.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.000]   - You're not alone, by the way.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.320]   - Oh, and I'm sure I'm not,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.600]   which is why- - No, no, I didn't mean that.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   I just mean that there are lots of people
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.840]   who can resonate with that.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.560]   So thank you for being vulnerable and sharing.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.520]   - Yeah, yeah, it's one of these things
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.160]   where I put my head down on the pillow, fall asleep,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.840]   and assuming I can get good sleep
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.600]   amidst those real-life events,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.400]   which is something that sometimes is the case,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.520]   sometimes it's not.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.480]   I always dream about things related to those events
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.960]   or those events in particular,
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.760]   and I'm a long-time practitioner of writing down my dreams
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.280]   when I wake up from them,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.400]   or as we discussed in an earlier episode,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.240]   my phone is on airplane mode at night.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.200]   Typically, I'll grab my phone
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.440]   and I'll hit the voice memo button, or function, rather,
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.720]   and I'll just, in my groggy state, with my eyes closed
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.160]   so I'm not getting any light in my eyes,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.320]   I'll say, I'll describe what I can recall of the dream.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   Then I'll sometimes go back
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.040]   and listen to those recordings,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.920]   and they've provided me insight,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   and in some cases, a path to solutions.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   So I'm 100% on board the fact that our dreams
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.240]   can help us resolve challenges in our waking day.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.920]   What's always fascinating to me, though,
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.440]   is how the dreams are not a one-for-one representation
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.000]   of what happened during the day.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.520]   I think symbolism is a hallmark feature of dreams,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.760]   and that's something I know we're going to talk about
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.240]   in terms of dream interpretation,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.600]   and much has been made of this throughout history.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.400]   So it seems that when we're asking
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.680]   what are the functions of dreaming,
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.000]   one of them is to resolve challenges
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.620]   from our daytime experience.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.120]   - Yeah, it's emotional first aid.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.700]   - Yeah, that's beautifully put.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.200]   And in an earlier episode on learning memory and creativity,
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.560]   you described how specific sleep stages
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.560]   and perhaps dreams themselves
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.120]   are involved in the consolidation
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.500]   of memories from daytime experiences
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.640]   or things that we're trying to learn
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.240]   from daytime experiences.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.680]   And then in the episode on sleep and emotions,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.960]   it was made very clear that rapid eye movement sleep
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.540]   is a time in which we get a sort of therapy
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.980]   that is a disentangling of the emotional load
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.100]   of a given experience from the experience.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.120]   So to me, it just seems so clear,
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.140]   like dreams are critical, sleep is critical.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.760]   But I think one question that still remains unresolved,
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.200]   at least for me, is are dreams really there
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.180]   to just be a replay of our waking lives
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.320]   with some distortion?
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.160]   Because when the conscious mind is asleep,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.900]   the unconscious mind can kind of throw things up
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.360]   to the surface in ways that don't seem so obvious,
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.100]   like symbolism, analogy.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.040]   Some of us are more visual than others.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.120]   Are there any rules about the way
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.800]   that dreams convert our waking experiences
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   into dream content?
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.960]   - There are.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.640]   And the short answer to your question,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.960]   do we simply go into sleep, start dreaming,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.360]   and then rewind the videotape and replay
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.760]   in a faithful recapitulation the waking day
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.840]   in our dreaming night?
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.680]   And the answer is no.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.120]   And here again, the scientist I mentioned before,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.320]   Robert Stickgold, with Roar Fosse,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.600]   they looked at this question.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.960]   And it was a very difficult study to do.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.720]   They did what we call experience sampling during the day.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.520]   And they would give you sort of like a little beeper,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.800]   and they would set it to go off multiple times
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.640]   throughout the day.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.120]   And then you would write down what it is
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.760]   that you were experiencing right in that moment.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.160]   And again, they were trying to build up
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.680]   this sort of time-lapse photography, as it were,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.960]   of your waking day experience.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   And then they would bring people in,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.640]   and they would start to record their dreams at night.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.760]   And then they would match those two
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.080]   and ask what is the degree of overlap?
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   What is the Venn diagram proportional percentage
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.920]   of those two things aligning?
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.600]   And what they found was that there was really only
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.440]   about 2% of your dreaming life
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.640]   that was a very faithful replay
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.440]   and reiteration of your waking life.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.240]   However, what they did find
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.160]   was something even more interesting to me,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.600]   which comes back to this idea of overnight therapy.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.480]   They found that there is something that runs through
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.880]   like a red thread narrative from your waking life
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.760]   into your dreaming life.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   That is emotional concerns and people of significance.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.240]   If there is anything in terms of an algorithm
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.680]   that seems to overlap and predict
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.840]   where those two Venn diagrams sort of collide,
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.840]   it really is in the emotional personal significance space,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:58.280]   once again, pointing us to perhaps a reaffirmation
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.320]   that a key function of dreaming
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.560]   is about dealing with our waking experiences
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.320]   and particularly the things that are salient to us.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.960]   - Okay, so clearly there's a functionality to dreaming,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.200]   but what should we make of the specific content
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.360]   of our dreams really?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.200]   Meaning, should we interpret our dreams
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.560]   or should we allow anyone else to interpret our dreams?
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.040]   There are scores of books out there, websites, programs.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.540]   There's a long history of this in classic psychoanalysis.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.260]   What about this dream interpretation business?
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.760]   - I mean, it really started,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   you have to give credit in some ways to Freud.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Although if you look back at very ancient cultures,
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.700]   so much of their artwork,
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.040]   so much of the sort of left imprint on the world
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.880]   suggests that they were fascinated by dreams
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.120]   and used dreams and gods of dreams.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.320]   So we've always been thinking about
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.760]   what are these things called dreams
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.520]   and can we interpret them?
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.080]   But it was really Freud who put his seminal works together
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.920]   in 1899 and then published it in 1901
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.960]   called "The Interpretation of Dreams."
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.440]   And it's probably one of his, if not his most famous text.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.840]   And you can unfairly sum it up as,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.140]   you know, if it's not one thing, it's your mother
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.080]   when it comes to Freud.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.080]   But in some ways, Freud with his interpretation attempt,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:36.040]   in my mind was 50% right and 100% wrong.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.720]   Because until the moment that Freud came along,
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   we left the interpretation and the instigation
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.620]   of our dreams to things outside of us.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.380]   Maybe it was, there were comments
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.800]   that it was due to our soul,
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.960]   or it was from the gods on high
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.920]   that they would descend down these dream manifestos to us.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.480]   But Freud, full credit, was the first person
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.160]   to put dreams front and center
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.200]   into this thing called the brain, the mind.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.520]   So in some ways, Freud shifted dream science
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.840]   from really more of a sort of spiritual philosophical
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.680]   condition to very much a neuro science.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.040]   It was of the mind and therefore of the brain.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.360]   And earlier, he had tried to describe the neural patterns,
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   and he had these beautiful drawings of neuronal circuits
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.520]   that could try to explain what was going on.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.360]   But neuroscience was so anemic at the time
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.520]   in terms of its knowledge,
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.480]   he had no chance to do what we can do now.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.680]   So in some ways, it's very unfair of me to criticize him
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.040]   as his theory being non-scientific.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.880]   It is also non-scientific
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.120]   in the very strict sense of the word.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.840]   When we create a scientific theory,
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.060]   just as though he created his interpretation
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.260]   of dreams theory,
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:09.080]   we allow that theory to be testable,
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.380]   which is to say that a scientific theory
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.000]   is only a scientific theory
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.940]   if it can be falsified or supported.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.640]   But Freud's theory was not a scientific theory.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.720]   It was not something that you could test
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   and therefore it was not able to be falsified or affirmed.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:35.280]   And in some ways it was Freud's simultaneous downfall
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.000]   and his utter genius.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   It's the reason that Freud remains to this day,
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.000]   because we can't put him in a way in a box and say,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.640]   we've disproven him,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.280]   but we equally will never be able to prove him.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.320]   And therefore he's been in some ways,
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.560]   let go in hard science as being representative.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.500]   His theory, which we don't need to get into,
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.320]   which was called disguised censorship,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.840]   was really a very interesting proposition,
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.120]   which was that there was something about our dreams
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.360]   that was veiled and masked.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.080]   And Freud believed that he understood
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.320]   the decryption code to our dreams.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.280]   And if you tell him your dream,
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.880]   he has the special filter
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.920]   that he can pull that dream through the filter
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.960]   and magically out on the other side
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.460]   is the true meaning of that dream.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.800]   There are several problems with that theory,
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.040]   not least of which I think,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.120]   at the time, if you look at his writings,
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.640]   it seemed that Freud was probably doing enough cocaine
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.000]   to kill a small horse at the time,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.880]   but we'll put that aside for a second.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.680]   The issue there is that it's not very replicable
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.440]   as an analysis method.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.560]   And there's a fascinating study that was,
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.880]   I remember from a conference,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.440]   I should check to see if it's been fully published.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.000]   And they did something clever.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.320]   They took the Freudian method
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.480]   and they took a single dream from one individual.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.000]   And they had three Freudian psychoanalysts
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.720]   analyze that dream.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.640]   So it was the same dream, but three different analysts.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.400]   Now in a scientific protocol,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.320]   if it's a scientifically rigorous assessment tool,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.440]   you would get back the very same answer
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.640]   from that measurement technique all three times
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   or very similar.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.440]   So for example, a carbon dating machine,
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.120]   if I were to take a fossil
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.440]   and put it in a carbon dating machine
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.800]   and then another one and another one,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   for the most part,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.400]   they're probably going to return something
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.200]   that's much more similar than different
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.840]   in terms of the carbon date of that fossil.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.680]   Why?
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.800]   Because it's been very well-validated and replicated.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.040]   That's what you want from a scientific method and tool.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.320]   But when they gave the single dream,
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.800]   the fossil as it were,
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.640]   to these three different interpreters,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   the three different carbon dating machines as who are,
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.360]   they all came up with completely different interpretations.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.920]   And so that's not necessarily a reliable, valid method.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.120]   So in that sense,
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.240]   we've abandoned and let go of Freud
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.480]   as being relevant or meaningful.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.200]   However, I personally,
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.000]   and I think if you look at the data,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.080]   I don't mean that to suggest
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.280]   that you should not try to think about
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.360]   and quote unquote, interpret your dreams.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.560]   And the term interpret when it comes to dreams is so loaded.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.960]   So I tend to, I would just simply say,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.960]   see if you can really deconstruct some of your dreams.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.640]   I think dreaming, just as we've spoken about,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.480]   is a very solid window into the things
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.520]   that you should be concerned about from your waking life.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.200]   It's very obvious that whatever it is
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.560]   that we typically dream are the things
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.480]   that our brain is telling us, the human being,
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.200]   this is the stuff that's essential.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.920]   This is the stuff you need to work through.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.520]   This is please pay attention to me.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.560]   And any amount of journaling or deliberation,
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.960]   digestion, cogitation of that specific dream
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.360]   is going to be beneficial to you.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.960]   Because in my mind,
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.880]   a life unexamined is not a life well-lived.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.080]   And that isn't just applicable to your waking life.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.200]   It's especially applicable to your dreaming life.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.280]   Now, does that mean I'm suggesting
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.640]   that everyone should race out
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.240]   and start cataloging and interpreting their dreams?
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.600]   Not necessarily.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.800]   But I am saying that if you wish to do that,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.440]   I, as a scientist, based on the data,
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.080]   I'm not telling you that that's hooey and non-scientific.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.560]   I think it's very valid.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.520]   It's just that some of the Freudian principles,
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.200]   I think, we've been able to dislocate ourselves from.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.360]   - I wholeheartedly agree with what you just said.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.520]   And I've spoken about dreams
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.760]   and their possible relevance to clinician psychiatrists,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.640]   such as Paul Conti and others,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.120]   some who have more of a psychoanalytic training than others.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   But certainly folks like Paul know a ton of neuroscience.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.960]   They understand pharmacology.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.520]   They understand family systems models,
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.480]   dialectical therapy, and so many other-
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.760]   - That man is, he's extraordinary.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.600]   He's not extraordinary, he's extraordinary.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.840]   - He is extraordinary.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.080]   And in part, because he can synthesize
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.920]   across all these different domains of psychiatry,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.600]   psychology, neuroscience, et cetera,
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.760]   as opposed to just existing in one silo,
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.120]   like psychoanalysis or psychopharmacology.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.600]   So, and there are others,
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   although few as extraordinary as Paul,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.700]   which is why we hosted him on the series here.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.280]   And one of the things that has come up
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.440]   in the discussions with Paul and others
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.340]   with similar training about dreams
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:03.460]   is that dreams seem to present us
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.520]   with emotional states and scenarios
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.120]   for which there's a lot of swapping in and out of identity.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.860]   So for instance, the notion of symbols within dreams
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.700]   is a longstanding conversation.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.900]   And I think one of the mistakes, as I understand it,
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.860]   is to assume that every time there's an animal in your dream
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.040]   that it represents children,
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.260]   or that every time it's a particular kind of animal,
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:28.220]   it represents your boss or something.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.980]   - Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.460]   - Right, right.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.260]   On the other hand, it's very clear that within our dreams,
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.980]   there's rarely a completely linear one-for-one relationship
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.700]   with what happened in the daytime of real experience.
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.100]   So there seems to be a swapping in and out.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.640]   And there, I just sort of zoom out,
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.780]   and forgive me for going long here,
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.940]   but I think this would be a good fodder
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.740]   for exploring this a little bit more deeply.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.500]   You know, one of the best descriptions of brain function
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.540]   that I've ever heard is from the Nobel Prize-winning
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.500]   neuroscientist Richard Axel at Columbia,
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.060]   who often talks about the brain creating abstractions
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:05.940]   of the outside world.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.900]   So if I were to take a photo of your face, for instance,
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.260]   and then show you that photograph, you'd say,
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.420]   "Yeah, that's me."
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.060]   But if I were a painter, I might, you know,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.980]   swap some of the positions of components of your face
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.820]   and show it to you.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.180]   And you might say, "Well, that doesn't look like me."
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.500]   And I'd say, "But that's my abstraction of your face."
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.460]   So to me, it makes sense because I understand the rules
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.460]   by which I made those swaps and moves.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.260]   There are some algorithms or rules that are known to me.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.380]   So there's a preservation of real world to the abstraction.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.180]   And that's really what our brain does all the time.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.780]   It attempts to faithfully represent the world around us,
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.100]   but it is indeed an abstraction.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.060]   And when it comes to the colors of things
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.180]   or the position of objects,
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:47.700]   it's as one-for-one as our brain is capable of.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.860]   But when it comes to ideas, to feelings,
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:53.260]   to our relationships to other people,
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.300]   the brain abstracts those in its own little neural symphony
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.500]   of this is the relationship to my dog.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.860]   This is the relationship to my friend
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.540]   and colleague, Matt Walker.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.180]   So it makes sense that in dreams,
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.900]   those algorithms could be different.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.020]   They could be faster or slower,
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.420]   but they could also be entirely different.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.900]   I don't think we yet know what the algorithms
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.460]   of transformation of real world experience
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.620]   to dream experience are.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.060]   And once we do, and I think someday we will understand those
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.740]   through electrical recordings and MRI type experiments.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.340]   And some of the experiments you talked about earlier
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.260]   point to this.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.620]   And so I think it's entirely reasonable to assume
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.500]   that we each have our own unique abstraction algorithms
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.700]   so that indeed we can have consistent representation
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.700]   of real world experiences in symbols,
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.220]   but that it's not going to be the same for everybody.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.060]   - Correct.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.780]   - Your way of abstracting your real life to your dream life
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.220]   could be entirely unique to you.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.580]   And mine could be entirely unique to me,
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.780]   making it very difficult for a third party to come in
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.140]   and say, okay, Matt, here's what your dream means.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.900]   But you can know what your dream means
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.260]   if you explore your dreams over time,
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.420]   not just that one dream.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.260]   Does that make sense?
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.780]   - It makes total sense because in some ways,
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.500]   there is no one who knows your own autobiography
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.140]   by definition than you, than yourself.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:16.700]   Now, I'm not suggesting that having that interpretation
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.740]   guided by someone who also understands
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.660]   the emotional problems that you're having
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.700]   and also sees your blind spots,
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.380]   which is what a really good therapist can do,
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.020]   can then help with that interpretation.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.900]   But you're right because my representation
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.620]   of information in the brain is going to be very biased
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.860]   by also what I've experienced in the past
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.740]   and how that past experience augments and modulates
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.300]   the current representation of that information
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:50.140]   and thus the meaning of it for me, the unique individual.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.820]   And you're also right to say that it's somehow,
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.180]   it's almost as though you're squinting your eyes
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.780]   when you're in dream sleep
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.940]   in terms of the true vision of things.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.300]   Things get a little bit wacky
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.060]   and distorted, this bizarre nature.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.380]   There is some very interesting data
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.220]   and it comes back to what we described earlier,
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.180]   the neurochemistry of the REM sleep state.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.260]   I told you that during REM sleep,
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.620]   levels of noradrenaline are at floor levels.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.300]   Noradrenaline is shut off.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.660]   One of the things if you sort of drop noradrenaline
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:28.460]   onto neural circuits, it will very much increase
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.460]   what we call the signal to noise.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.380]   And this is why noradrenaline, when it's released
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.180]   or if you administer it to an animal,
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:40.900]   you can become almost more directed.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.460]   You're much more divergent.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.100]   You're focused in attending and it's really there.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.220]   You're very blinkered.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.900]   You're very focused.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.660]   But when that goes away, the neural circuits
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.020]   become a little bit more loosey goosey.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.220]   And I also told you that the other chemical,
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.660]   if there is a neurochemical that defines REM sleep dreaming,
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.980]   it's this thing called acetylcholine.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.620]   And acetylcholine seems to do the opposite.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.940]   It seems to inject a little bit more noise
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.580]   relative to the signal.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.380]   So in other words, your brain circuits
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:18.740]   are neurochemically modulated when you dream
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.780]   to inject almost what we would think of as fuzzy logic.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.220]   And this is why I think the analogy that we spoke about
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.940]   in a previous episode holds that when you are awake
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.140]   and you're given some information,
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.380]   you produce the most obvious links and obvious associations
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.980]   because you're very much blinkered
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.940]   and you have noradrenaline on board.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:42.460]   But when you go into dream sleep,
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.060]   it's almost like the Google search.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.020]   When you're awake, go straight to page one
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.980]   and it's very related.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:51.700]   But do that same search when you're in the dream state
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:58.460]   and you go straight to page 35 and it's an utterly bizarre
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.060]   page.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.380]   And you think, hang on a second.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.340]   This has got nothing to do with the search term.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.820]   When you read it, you think, well, if I squint my eyes,
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.500]   it kind of does.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.620]   It's very distant, very non-obvious.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.860]   But that's a very smart connection
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.460]   that as a waking brain, I never would have put together.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.900]   So I think neurochemically, we can start to understand it.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.660]   But I think this is a very good important point where
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.620]   you could almost say the very best person
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.460]   to interpret your dreams is probably you.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.700]   I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Whoop.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.220]   Whoop is a fitness wearable device
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.380]   that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:38.260]   but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.980]   on how to adjust your training and sleep
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.740]   schedule to perform better.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.900]   As a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.060]   of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking,
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.220]   for monitoring other features of my physiology,
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.180]   and for giving me a lot of feedback about metrics
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.660]   within my brain and body that tell me how hard I should
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.140]   train or not train and basically point to the things
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.820]   that I'm doing correctly and incorrectly in my daily life
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.420]   that I can adjust using protocols, some of which
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.460]   are actually within the Whoop app.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.300]   Given that many of us have goals such as improving our sleep,
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.580]   building better habits, or just focusing more
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.340]   on our overall health, Whoop is one
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.780]   of the tools that can really help you get personalized data,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.580]   recommendations, and coaching toward your overall health.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.180]   In addition to being one of the most accurate sleep trackers
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.500]   in the world, Whoop allows you to recover more quickly
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.820]   and fully from physical exercise and other kinds of stress
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.580]   and thereby to train more effectively and sleep better.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.140]   If you're interested in trying Whoop,
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.860]   you can go to join.whoop.com/huberman today

[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.460]   - Some dreams we'd rather not have.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:45.020]   Here I'm specifically referring to nightmares.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:50.020]   I've had one nightmare countless times throughout my life.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.340]   I won't share what it is.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.380]   It's not a real world experience,
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.620]   or at least it's not a one-for-one of real world experience,
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.700]   but I've had this nightmare since I was a kid.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.140]   I have it seldom these days,
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.900]   but every time it starts again, I'm like, "Oh no."
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.980]   And there's a bit of a lucidity to it,
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.500]   where I'm like, "I hear him again."
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.660]   Been working on this one a while, as you can imagine.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.280]   But given what we understand about the relationship
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.900]   between real world experiences and dreams,
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.060]   what should we make of the fact that we have nightmares?
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:22.940]   So let's just start there.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.860]   The phenomenon of nightmares,
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.700]   does it represent something that troubled us in the daytime
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.460]   and that we're trying to work out in our sleep?
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.500]   And then maybe we can get into some of the specifics
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.940]   around why, regardless of whether or not the answer
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.880]   to that question is yes or no,
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.060]   that we would have this thing called nightmares,
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.700]   especially given that there's all this machinery
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.900]   to make sure that we don't move
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.080]   and the noradrenaline is low in the brain
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.820]   while we're dreaming.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.940]   Seems like there's all sorts of mechanisms
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.300]   to try and ensure that our dreams are very pleasant
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.100]   or at least neutral, but nightmares suck.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.500]   But, so I'd love to know-
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.860]   - Get me that T-shirt, please.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.140]   - So I'd love to know that they serve some utility.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.740]   - So nightmares, how do we define a nightmare
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.940]   in sort of science clinically?
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.020]   It's a little bit tricky,
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.500]   but usually the way we define it is
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.860]   it's a strongly unpleasant dream
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:19.860]   that causes some time of daytime displeasure.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.460]   So in other words,
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.320]   some type of daytime dysfunction or distress.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.500]   So everyone can have a bad dream,
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.780]   but when you go up into your waking life
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.540]   and about your waking day,
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.580]   it doesn't seem to bother you too much.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.420]   And maybe we'll just say that's a bad dream.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.220]   When it really becomes a nightmare
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.460]   is when I almost think of it as though you wake up
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.380]   and that blanket of strong nightmare emotion
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.740]   is still wrapped around you and you can feel it.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.580]   You can just know there's,
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.980]   my emotional state is still heavy
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.860]   and I know exactly where it came from.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.540]   And it was from that nightmare.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.060]   And throughout the day,
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.620]   you don't seem to be able to de-robe yourself
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.540]   from that cloaked affect of the nightmare,
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.400]   drenches you almost.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.460]   That's where it really starts to become unpleasant.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.540]   And we actually do have a clinical category.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.700]   It's called nightmare disorder.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.460]   And the way we typically define that
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.340]   is the same thing as I said,
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.200]   a very unpleasant dream
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.020]   that causes some type of daytime distress.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.180]   And it's happening at least once a week.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.860]   At that point, we start to move it
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.700]   into this category of nightmare disorder.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:41.460]   What are nightmares doing, if anything at all?
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.860]   There are at least two theories.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.900]   One is that it's simply the system failing,
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.620]   the system gone wrong.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.140]   And we're not processing, we're not moving through things.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.940]   And therefore nightmares are maladaptive.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.540]   They're not warranted, they're not normative.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.700]   The other is that no, they are adaptive
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.660]   and they are meaningful.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.620]   And it's us really trying to go
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.540]   to a very specific pain point.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.860]   And we continue to process it over and over,
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   perhaps to the point where we get resolution.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.780]   But sometimes we just don't.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.140]   So it keeps cropping up.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:24.220]   We don't have good data to disambiguate those two right now.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.860]   So I think it still remains open.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:29.300]   At least I don't know of any data that tells me,
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.700]   are they functional or are they maladaptive?
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.060]   Even when we get that answer,
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.500]   in some ways it doesn't change the fact
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.180]   that it still leaves a patient with nightmares,
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.540]   with recurring nightmares.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.940]   So then what do you do about that?
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.940]   How do we, is there any treatment for people out there
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.860]   if they're under this distress, is there hope?
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.980]   And for a long time,
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.980]   there really wasn't very much hope at all.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.460]   You just had to go through it.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.420]   But recently there was a method that was developed
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.380]   and it's very effective.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.140]   And it is called IRT,
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.100]   which stands for Image Rehearsal Therapy.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.940]   And its basis comes back to something that in fact we,
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.660]   I think hopefully published the first evidence
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.660]   in humans of some years ago now
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:26.020]   called memory reconsolidation.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.420]   So in our episode on learning and memory,
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.540]   we said that there is at least sort of
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.980]   two main steps of memory.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.460]   First, you have to imprint and learn the memory,
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.100]   lay down that memory trace.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.340]   But then that memory is very fragile
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.820]   and vulnerable to being overwritten
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.900]   by competing information knocked out of place.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.780]   And for you to hold onto that memory,
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.420]   you have to go through a second step
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.700]   called memory consolidation, a very slow process.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.420]   It's like a very slow pressing of the save button
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.620]   because it's biological.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.540]   It requires protein synthesis and all of that good stuff.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.780]   But that always struck me as a strange model
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:06.180]   because it's the equivalent of opening up a Word document,
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.300]   you type out all of the information into it,
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.700]   and then you hit the save button.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.260]   So I've encoded, imprinted the information
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.300]   that I've hit save and saved it.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.340]   And then I close that file.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.860]   And then the next day I come back or some days later,
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.580]   and I double click on that file again
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.060]   because I want to edit it.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.740]   I either want to add to it
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.660]   or I want to revise it and change it.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.740]   But according to that model, it's been locked in place
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.820]   and you could never edit that Word document.
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.140]   That seems like a profoundly useless way
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.060]   to store information.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.620]   And what we learned is that every time in subsequent days,
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.020]   when you reactivate, which is to say,
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.620]   when you recollect the memory that has been consolidated,
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.860]   it opens that memory file back up
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.140]   to once again, being plastic and malleable.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.660]   So you can go in and update the information
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.220]   in that memory store.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.660]   And then the next night, you consolidate it again.
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.460]   In other words, you re-consolidate it.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.700]   So it's memory updating.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.300]   And there is a very clear mechanism in the human brain
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.020]   that allows us to do this memory updating,
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.420]   iteratively, time and time again.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   This comes back to nightmare disorders.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.180]   This therapy, Image Rehearsal Therapy or IRT,
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.420]   will have you sit down with a therapist.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.700]   And at first you'll describe the nightmare
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.740]   that you're going through
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.100]   and you'll write that narrative down.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.020]   And then working with a therapist,
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:40.020]   you will agree to think about a more neutral ending
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.420]   to that nightmare.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.460]   So let's say that I was involved
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.420]   in a very, very difficult car crash.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.020]   It was just horrific.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.100]   And every night since, I'd say at least once a week,
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.540]   I just continue to have the nightmare of the car crash.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.380]   I know that I'm traveling towards the junction.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.340]   I apply the brakes, the brakes have failed.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.740]   I am just looking around.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.940]   I'm trying to maneuver,
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.620]   but nothing is going to change this.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.100]   I go through the red light and someone sideswipes me
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.060]   and that's the end.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:19.980]   And I relive that time and time again, and it's awful.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.860]   So you with the therapist, or I with the therapist,
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.700]   would then start to say,
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.100]   "Well, what about the alternative scenario?"
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.220]   I depress the brake and the brakes don't work,
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.060]   but gradually I think,
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.900]   "Well, I'm just going to reach over to the handbrake
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.900]   "and I'm going to gradually apply the handbrake."
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.620]   And that slowly is going to bring the car
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.940]   to a nice safe stop.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.820]   And then I'm going to call the emergency services.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.500]   The car is going to get towed.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.100]   I don't go through the junction.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.620]   I survive, everything's fine.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.540]   So you rehearse this alternate ending
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:58.140]   and you keep going through that, rehearsing that.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.580]   And then you go to sleep the next night
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.500]   and you'll probably have a high chance
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.820]   of that nightmare again.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.860]   But if you keep doing that,
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.700]   once you've got that alternative ending,
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.900]   essentially what you're trying to do
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.500]   is every time you reactivate the memory
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.860]   of the trauma car crash,
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.060]   and then you rehearse this alternate ending,
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.740]   it's like me going into the Word document
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:25.140]   and editing the section that was really horrific and bad
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.220]   and replacing it with something that's neutral
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.140]   or even positive.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:33.180]   And over time, then I sleep and I will consolidate
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.020]   that memory.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.380]   I'll come back the next day
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.300]   and I'll do some more editing and more updating.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.260]   And time after time after time,
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.340]   gradually you dissipate the narrative
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.980]   that is fixed inside of the brain.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.180]   And the nightmare frequency decreases in proportion.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.220]   Now it's not effective for 100% of patients.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.900]   If you look at the data on average,
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.460]   it's about two out of every three people.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.300]   So about 66% of people will benefit,
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.980]   which if you look at some medical treatments,
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.660]   that's a great treatment.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.220]   That's still very effective.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:13.460]   There was a very recent study from Sophie Schwartz
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.060]   and her colleagues at the University of Geneva
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.540]   that did an even more ingenious study.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.700]   And they were able to nudge the effectiveness
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   of that treatment from 66% up to 92%.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:33.340]   And they used an additional memory related research tool.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.060]   We've come up with in sleep science
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.820]   and it's called TMR or targeted memory reactivation.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.260]   And here's how it goes.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.980]   I'm going to have you learn a set of associations.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.460]   Have you ever played that card game?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.420]   I think in America it's called memory,
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:53.220]   which is very apt where you get a deck of cards
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.380]   and it has two of the same item,
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.980]   two houses, two cars, two fire engines, two kettles,
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.060]   and you shuffle the cards
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.100]   and then you put them face down in a big square
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.340]   and a big matrix.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.700]   And over time you have to turn over one card
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.860]   and it's a kettle.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.980]   And then I'm just going to randomly pick another card
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.660]   and it's a fire engine.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.500]   Okay.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.020]   But gradually you start to learn
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.260]   where each one of the pairs are located.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:22.300]   So what's clever about that is we would do that type
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.500]   of what's called a paired association memory test.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.620]   You learn these paired associates
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.780]   and then we test you after a night of sleep
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.860]   and you're better.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.820]   However, if for, as you're turning those items over,
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.620]   I play a congruent sound.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.540]   So let's say you turn over the fire engine.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.020]   And then when you turn over the other fire engine,
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.060]   I'm going to start playing a fire engine noise
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.020]   in the background.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.980]   So I'm bonding the association of the memory card pairs
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.940]   with this tone, with this congruent sound.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.940]   And then a kettle, I turn over a kettle,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.020]   I turn over the other kettle and it's whistling.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:06.140]   And then when you let people sleep at night,
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:10.140]   if you start replaying those same tones
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.700]   at a sub-awakening threshold,
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.340]   so you're not waking people up and you bring them back.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.820]   And let's say that you only do those sound cue reactivations
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.300]   for half of the memories that you've done
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.580]   and the other half you leave untouched.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.100]   So within an individual,
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.740]   you have a unique within individual control.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.460]   You test them on the things that you didn't reactivate
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.500]   at night and those that you did.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.540]   It's almost like creating a bespoke playlist at night
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.780]   where you say, look, I learned all of this information
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.780]   during the day, or wouldn't this be wonderful?
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.060]   And then here's the stuff that I really think,
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.660]   personally to me, I want to remember.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.580]   Well, it turns out I'd been tagging that
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.700]   with particular music.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.540]   And then at night I replayed that music.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.620]   And the next day, it turns out
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.740]   that those things I reactivated
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.820]   are much more strongly consolidated by way of sleep
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.860]   than those things I didn't.
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.820]   So that's the basic method of what we call TMR,
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.620]   targeted memory reactivation.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.180]   What they did was something very clever.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.820]   They had them go through this process
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.580]   of the image rehearsal therapy.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.020]   They were rehearsing the alternate ending,
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.740]   but about every 10 seconds,
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.100]   they were playing them this very pleasing piano chord
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.700]   in the background.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.660]   And they were just bonding the association
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.500]   of the new outcome ending to the nightmare
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.500]   with this pleasant piano chord.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.140]   And then sure enough, in the subsequent weeks afterwards,
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.340]   not only was that person day after day
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:43.420]   doing the diligent therapy practice of rehearsing the memory
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.660]   whilst the piano tone was playing,
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.820]   but then at night they would wait
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.060]   until they went into REM sleep,
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.940]   which is the state we think the emotional therapy begins,
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.260]   and they would start to replay
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:00.500]   that same piano chord over and over again.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.540]   And sure enough,
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.820]   those people who had image rehearsal therapy standard,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.580]   they improved by about 60%
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.700]   in their nightmare frequency reduction.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.220]   Those people who did that,
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:13.300]   plus the memory reactivation at night,
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.300]   it drove it from 66% all the way up to 92%.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.740]   So now modern day neuroscience with its techniques
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.660]   is starting to overlap with classical clinical psychology.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.820]   And we're developing these next forefront of methods
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.860]   that really harness and fine tune the brain's ability
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.260]   to undergo effective therapy.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:39.100]   - It's incredible.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.500]   I mean, I think that we've known about classical conditioning
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.480]   for a long time.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.480]   And the case of Pavlov's dogs is the most known of those.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.080]   Known of those.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.960]   Am I right in recalling that this paired association way
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.800]   of bringing about certain memories
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.360]   or strengthening certain memories in sleep
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.400]   can also be accomplished with odors?
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.980]   That it's not just the playing of tones
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.840]   during specific experiences,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.400]   but also for instance,
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.680]   if one were to pair a particular odor
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.640]   with a certain novel memory event in the daytime
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.680]   or attempt to learn something new,
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.760]   that if that odor is then infused
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.040]   into the room of the sleeping person later that night,
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.400]   that somehow the memories would be strengthened.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.560]   Do I have that correct?
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.180]   - There's nothing, I've said it before,
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.400]   I'll say it again, nothing wrong with your memory.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.120]   That was one of the seminal papers
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.800]   that started this whole movement.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.440]   And what they did was they had them learn
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.480]   this kind of paired associate card test,
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.720]   but they were wearing this mask,
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.160]   almost looks like a fighter pilot mask.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.400]   And they were either puffing up inert air
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.640]   that didn't smell at all,
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.040]   or they were perfusing this very pleasant rose scent.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.920]   Because smell in particular
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.640]   has a very unique relationship with our memory,
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.600]   in part because we emerged from animals
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.000]   that would principally use smell as their navigational tool.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.120]   I think everyone has had this experience
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.920]   where you bond a certain cologne or a certain perfume
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.160]   with a particular individual.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.640]   So they were puffing the rose perfume
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   up the nose of these participants.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.080]   And then when they went into sleep,
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.280]   they started to re-perfuse that rose odor.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.120]   Now, what was clever also about the experiment,
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.080]   you could say, well, look,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.240]   just anytime you get something that smells
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.080]   puffed up your nose, your memory is going to be better.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.160]   Now, the initial experiment had them learning
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.640]   the information when they're awake
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.560]   with the rose scent getting pushed up the nose.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   And then when they slept, they had the rose odor again.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.480]   Another group had learning,
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.840]   but they had no rose smell pushed up their nose
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.040]   to bond with the information
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.480]   at the time of learning when they were awake.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.760]   And then when they slept,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   they also had rose odor stuffed up their nose
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.760]   and they showed no additional benefit.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.760]   So it's not just enough to have rose odor at night,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.040]   you need to have made the initial bonded familiar connection
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.120]   with the novel information that you're learning
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.760]   to get the subsequent
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.120]   targeted memory reactivation benefit.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.200]   And you could then think, well, practical tools,
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.040]   what should I do?
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.120]   Maybe when I'm learning for studying for a test,
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.560]   I should blaze up my most preferred incense.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.120]   And I have a particular proclivity
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.840]   to green tea incense, it turns out.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.600]   And maybe then before I go to bed at night,
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.880]   I get a couple of sticks and I blaze them back up,
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.440]   took my head on the pillow, turn the light out.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.440]   However, do not do that
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.560]   because it's probably a desperate fire hazard.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.840]   So do not listen to me,
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.120]   but you could think about doing something
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.720]   along those lines, perhaps.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.480]   Anyway, so that's targeted memory reactivation.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   - Yeah, it's a perfect segue
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.080]   for what I wanted to talk about next,
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.480]   which is lucid dreaming.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.200]   But before we move to lucid dreaming,
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.000]   I'm wondering whether or not there's an opportunity here
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.520]   to construct an experiment,
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.840]   maybe even a protocol of sorts,
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   to uncouple the negative experience of nightmares
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.240]   to our daily experience.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.400]   So for instance, we're talking about paired association
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.880]   based on odors or sounds replayed in sleep
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   to sort of nudge or conjure particular daytime memories
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.420]   to the surface in the form of dream sleep.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:36.560]   But we also know that one can uncouple associations.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:41.700]   So for instance, if one experienced something negative,
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.480]   and maybe this is being attempted
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.900]   in the realm of trauma therapy,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:52.080]   and that experience was paired with a particular odor,
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.180]   it'd be hard to do with visual cues in sleep, or sound,
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:20:01.280]   could one attempt to introduce a sort of a competing sound,
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.440]   you know, set up a sort of a collision
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.020]   stimulus so that in sleep,
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.580]   the dream would no longer contain the scary content,
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.100]   where it would be less scary?
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.260]   Or is this exactly the wrong approach?
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.040]   Because if we believe that the nightmares
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.620]   are serving some functional purpose,
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.240]   allowing us to work through-
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.660]   - What you really don't wanna do.
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.640]   - Right, okay, great.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.620]   Then we answered the question.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.500]   - Well, no, I think it's unclear right now,
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.380]   but you're on the right line
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.800]   because there is something that we have
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.360]   in learning and memory called fear extinction.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.080]   And let's say that I were to
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   sort of classic Pavlovian learning, Pavlov's dogs.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.140]   Let's say I show you a specific image on the screen,
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.660]   and then you hear a specific tone,
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.960]   and then you get an electric shock.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.760]   I show you the stimulus on the screen,
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.320]   you hear the specific tone,
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.120]   and then you get an electrical shock.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.560]   Then I don't show you the stimulus on the screen,
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.440]   but you do still hear the tone.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.300]   And then what happens is that you have a braced response
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.760]   to the electrical shock.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.240]   And there's all sorts of combinations in between of that.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:15.440]   But essentially, I condition you to learn
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:18.280]   that these things seem to be associated
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.640]   with a negative outcome.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.740]   The inverse being the Pavlovian dog,
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.040]   which is that you ring a bell,
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.100]   you show the dog some food and it salivates.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:26.940]   You ring the bell,
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.880]   you show the dog some food and it salivates.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.260]   And then you ring the bell,
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.740]   you don't give it some food,
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.720]   and it still salivates because it knows
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.400]   that the bell precedes the meat being shown.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.680]   And I actually mixed my order around there
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:42.600]   in my own experiment to begin with.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.420]   But then there's something different that you can do.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.880]   You can start to perhaps change the sound
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   or the bonded connection,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.840]   and then you don't start getting the shock anymore.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.400]   So that same ringing of the bell
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.060]   now is no longer consistently associated with the food.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.860]   And gradually you decondition the dog
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:08.380]   such that after some time it learns,
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.440]   oh, I started to learn that the bell predicted food,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.980]   but now it no longer does.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.420]   And it takes some time to remove that.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.620]   And that's what we call extinction.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.380]   You've induced an association
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.140]   and then you gradually extinguish it
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.260]   by way of that alternate training method.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.740]   So the question then became,
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:30.640]   could we use that type of method, but during sleep,
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.400]   could we train you up on a fear memory
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.960]   and then just begin the early signs of extinguishing,
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.240]   of deconditioning you?
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.960]   But then we don't do that very much.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.560]   We wait until sleep
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.120]   and we continue the deconditioning protocol.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.920]   And sure enough, sleep seems to be as if not more effective
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.840]   at extinguishing those fear memories
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.860]   than when you enact the protocol during wakefulness.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.900]   So here is a very good example
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.100]   of where you can use
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:06.620]   this sleep dependent memory processing tapestry,
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:09.340]   this opportunity to harness,
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.100]   not just to strengthen memories that you wish to keep,
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:17.380]   but start to extinguish memories you wish to remove.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.020]   And so I think it's a very exciting,
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.300]   it's right on the cusp
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.380]   of what we're starting to do right now.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.740]   - I love it because I think some people
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.640]   would like to experience certain dreams
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.400]   and other people would like to
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.140]   not experience certain nightmares,
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.460]   which reminds me of a tool that Rick Rubin taught me.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:36.520]   I don't know of any experiments that support this directly,
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.360]   but I've tried this
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.920]   and it certainly has worked first time and every time,
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.440]   which is, Rick said, if you wake up from a dream
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.160]   and you want to remember your dream
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:50.120]   and/or you found it pleasant or interesting,
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.520]   lay there completely still with your eyes closed
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.160]   and it will come to you.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.720]   Whereas if you wake up from a nightmare,
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.200]   which many people do,
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.040]   and in a state of anxiety
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.440]   and you have a hard time kind of shaking
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.260]   the disturbing affect associated with that nightmare
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.840]   to move your body,
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.040]   get up and move your body
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.800]   and maybe even flip some lights on,
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.200]   something that normally I don't suggest
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.040]   in the middle of the night,
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:18.160]   but waking up from a nightmare can be quite disturbing
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.560]   and it can be disturbing enough
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.960]   that it makes it difficult to fall back asleep.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.080]   So, and by the way, he's right.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.840]   I don't know if he's read the science
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.160]   or it's, he's just, knowing Rick,
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.960]   he's probably just because he's so Yoda-like,
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.600]   he's probably intuited.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.440]   - He has supernatural levels of insight.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.600]   - Tens of thousands of scientific articles,
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   but he's absolutely right.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.640]   One of the ways, if you really wish to remember your dreams
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.680]   is not just jump up out of bed
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.760]   and start trying to write them down.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.080]   Don't.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.960]   Lie in bed, keep your eyes closed
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.720]   and gradually rehearse that dream
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.400]   over and over in your mind,
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.560]   almost as though you're scoring it
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.200]   into the etched surface of your memory,
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.480]   trace more and more.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:05.240]   And gradually when you've re sort of capitulated
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.800]   and pieced back the jigsaw puzzle,
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.160]   then gradually open your eyes,
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.800]   start to dictate, start to write down,
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.280]   but don't do it immediately
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.480]   because as soon as you start doing it,
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.000]   it begins to float away,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.560]   it begins to dissolve in a way
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.880]   that you're running and you're trying
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.000]   to reach your hand out or grab them.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.120]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.080]   This is why I use the voice memos.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.520]   Last night I woke up in the middle of the night
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.960]   from a dream and I decided to turn on voice memos.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.920]   And I remember thinking,
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.040]   I'll remember this in the morning.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.200]   And I remember, you never remember this in the morning.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.040]   I did it.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.440]   That is a perfect segue for lucid dreaming,
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.880]   which is the awareness that we are dreaming
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.640]   while in a dream.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.360]   Is lucid dreaming real?
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.080]   Can we train ourselves to lucid dream?
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.400]   And what is the value of lucid dreaming?
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.840]   Is it just a fun game we can play?
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.200]   Is there any reason we should attempt to lucid dream
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.040]   if we don't already or encourage more lucid dreaming?
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.240]   - Or even any reason we shouldn't, perhaps.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.280]   Lucid dreaming, you beautifully gave the definition.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.040]   Loosely defined lucid dreaming
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.320]   is that you simply know that you're dreaming
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.600]   whilst you are dreaming.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.960]   So in other words, as the dream is unfolding,
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   you gain awareness of, ah, this is a dream,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.480]   but I'm still dreaming.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.160]   At that moment, by science definition,
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.000]   you are in a state of lucidity.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.640]   But most people don't really mean that
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.440]   when they say, oh, I'm a lucid dreamer.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.960]   They mean, yes, I become aware that I'm dreaming
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.600]   as I am dreaming.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.760]   And then I take over the reins of control.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.040]   And then starting to decide exactly what it is you dream
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.360]   and how you dream.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.280]   So now I'm on the ground and I'm walking through a park
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.680]   and I decide that I just want to take off
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.720]   and I want to fly over the river
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.160]   or I want to fly out over San Francisco Bay and take a tour.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.120]   So I decide to start flying.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.800]   That is what most people think of as lucid dreaming.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.120]   If you were to think about it,
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.520]   this thing called dreaming, as we've described,
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.120]   is utterly absurd as a state
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.600]   based on its psychotic kind of nature and characteristics
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.520]   to then start to say,
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.120]   it's that idiotic and strange and bizarre,
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.960]   but P.S., I can also take control of it
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.680]   and decide what I want to do with it,
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.440]   injects a whole dose of disbelief
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.600]   into a process that's already unbelievable by itself.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.160]   So science for a while just thought,
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.240]   this is charlatan type stuff
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.760]   that these people claim that they can control their dreams.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.560]   How can you ever prove that?
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.120]   Because don't forget when you go into REM sleep
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.000]   and you dream, you are paralyzed.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.920]   So I can't just wake up and say, I was lucid dreaming.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.160]   That's not proof.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.560]   I have to, in some ways, be able to demonstrate
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.320]   that I'm lucid dreaming as I begin to become lucid,
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.960]   but I can't because I can't communicate with you
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.160]   as the scientist.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.480]   Well, it turns out that you can.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.680]   One of the things we spoke about in the first episode
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.000]   is that yes, you get these rapid eye movements,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.920]   but think about what that means.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.440]   I told you that when you dream,
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.760]   your brain paralyzes all of your voluntary muscles
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.200]   so that you can dream and dream safely
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.760]   and you don't act out your dreams,
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.440]   with the exception that at least two muscle groups,
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.280]   your extraocular muscles that move your eyes
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.040]   and your inner ear muscles,
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.800]   for some reason they are spurred from the paralysis
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.920]   so you can still move.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.040]   Otherwise you could never have rapid eye movements.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.840]   So the eyes, all of a sudden,
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.680]   because we have electrodes up top and below
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.000]   and left and right sides,
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.160]   we can measure what you're doing with your eyes during sleep.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.240]   In fact, we have to do this to determine,
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.480]   are you awake or are you in REM sleep?
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.040]   The brain activity by itself doesn't tell us that.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.760]   We measure your muscle activity,
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.040]   and if you lose muscle activity
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.640]   and your brain is very active
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.000]   and the eye channels that we're recording
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.200]   start to show these darting back and forth signals,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.320]   we know you're in REM sleep, that's how we define it.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.360]   So that then suggested to us,
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.120]   we can use the eye movements
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.680]   to create a form of Morse code signaling
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.160]   from the participant to the experimenter.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.000]   And so let's say that with this claimed lucid dreamer
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.680]   who comes to my sleep center,
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.840]   we'll create a very specific agreed upon code,
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:42.160]   which is that as you start dreaming, I can see that.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.160]   And when you become lucid in that dream,
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.960]   firstly, give me three leftward flicks of your eyes.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   We never see that in dreaming.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.200]   It's a very deliberative act.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.520]   And then when you say,
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.360]   okay, I've started the lucid dreaming
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.520]   and you've agreed with the experimenter
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.960]   that you're then going to start moving your hands,
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.320]   you're going to start to move your right hand.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.440]   Well, when you start to move your right hand,
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.000]   give me four flicks to the right.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.760]   And when you're moving your left hand in the dream,
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.280]   give me four flicks to the left.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.200]   And so there we create
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.000]   this very specific instigational code.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.040]   But then how does that help us?
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.920]   Well, we can have you sleeping in a brain scanner.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.920]   And before the brain scanning session, when you sleep,
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.320]   I have you just go into the brain scanner awake
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.000]   and I say, move your left hand
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.120]   and your right motor cortex is going to be lighting up.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.720]   And then I'm going to say, move your right hand
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.560]   and your left motor cortex is going to be lighting up.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.480]   And for you and me, I build up a very unique map
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.120]   of your left hand motor memory representation
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.800]   and your right hand motor memory representation.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.000]   And if it's the left hand,
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.600]   as I said, it's the right side of the brain.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.960]   If it's the right hand, it's the left side of the brain.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.040]   So now I've got ground truth
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.480]   as to where your hand representation is
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.440]   on your motor cortex in my brain scanner.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.600]   And then I'm going to put you back in the brain scanner,
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.480]   let you go into sleep, let you start dreaming.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.920]   Then you give me three left flicks, good.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.280]   This person has now become lucid.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.640]   And now he's doing four rightward flicks,
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.480]   which means he's clasping his right hand
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.200]   over and over again.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.040]   And then he gives me four leftward flicks,
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.360]   which means he switched over.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.160]   He's now using his left hand in his dream.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.120]   By the way, I'm looking at the participant
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.240]   inside of the brain scanner through the glass.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.080]   And of course, they're not moving their hand.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.000]   Why? Because they're paralyzed.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.680]   But in the dream, they are claiming
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.320]   based on their eye movements
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.840]   that they are moving their hands.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.800]   We bring them back out of the brain scanner
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.320]   and we analyze their brain scans during the period
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.200]   when they said, I'm moving my right hand,
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.880]   I'm moving my left hand.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.520]   What did we see?
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.520]   Sure enough, we saw the same.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.040]   And we being the Royal We,
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.040]   it's a great city by a German group.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.080]   Sure enough, you see exactly the same pattern.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.200]   It was scientific ground truth evidence
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.320]   that when a lucid dreamer claims
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.160]   they are doing something in their dream,
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.120]   the brain scans that we received confirmed
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.920]   that indeed that's exactly what was happening.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.920]   - It's just that none of the signal is being sent out
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.360]   to the periphery, to the limbs,
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.880]   because there's that-
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.120]   - Cut off at the spinal cord.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.160]   - Descending inhibition.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.000]   - Yeah, at the level of the alpha motor neurons
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   of your spinal cord.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.840]   - Incredible.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.640]   So here we are talking about lucid dreaming,
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.660]   which is a kind of mixed level of consciousness.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:43.160]   Dreaming, of course, but also lucidity.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.080]   That is an awareness that one is dreaming.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.640]   Now, in just about every one of the five episodes
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.940]   leading up to this sixth episode in this series,
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:55.580]   you emphasize the key importance of deep sleep
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.360]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:01.400]   And in many ways, some of the problems that arise
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:04.760]   from waking up in the middle of the night too many times
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.240]   or being in shallow sleep, as opposed to deep sleep,
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.240]   lucid dreaming, it seems, is a kind of a case of light sleep
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.700]   because of one's awareness, or is it?
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.240]   So that's one, the first question.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.940]   And then just very quickly, an anecdote.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.320]   When I was a kid, I used to read these
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.560]   like "Boy's Life" magazines and those kinds of things.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.720]   I forget what they're called,
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:28.840]   but in the back they would have these ads for products
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.640]   like x-ray glasses or sea monkeys,
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.900]   which turned out to be brine shrimp.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.440]   What a disappointment that was.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.240]   And I thought they were monkeys.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.080]   On the package, they were little monkeys,
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.440]   but they were brine shrimp.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.600]   There was a product advertised that I in fact purchased,
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.960]   which was an eye mask that had a little blinking red light
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.400]   in one corner.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.680]   And it said, "Learn to lucid dream."
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.900]   And the idea was that you would put this thing on
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.400]   and look at the red light just prior to going to sleep.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.760]   And then you'd go to sleep with this thing on.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.200]   And then at some point in your sleep,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:07.040]   you would see or think that you saw the red light flashing.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.800]   And the idea was that because you were in the eye mask,
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.400]   you were in enough of a dream
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.320]   that you would be able to link the waking state
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.960]   recognition of the light, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:16.920]   Okay, people get it.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.280]   I purchased that product.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.440]   I used it.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.880]   I thought perhaps there was an effect, quote unquote,
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.360]   where I could lucid dream,
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.880]   but I wouldn't consider myself an avid lucid dreamer.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   Although sometimes I am aware that I'm dreaming
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.640]   and usually it's in pleasant dreams,
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.620]   in which case I'm usually like, yeah, let's keep this going.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:40.840]   Things like flying and being particularly talented
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.040]   in a sport that in my waking life,
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.480]   I had to ask for minimal things like that.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.920]   Okay, so is lucid dreaming a case of shallow sleep
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.560]   and therefore something to avoid?
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.180]   Or is lucid dreaming something quite different?
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:57.640]   And is there any advantage to learning to lucid dream
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.280]   or enhancing one's amount of lucid dreaming?
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.820]   And if so, how should one go about that?
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:06.940]   - So I'll take the question, should you be lucid dreaming?
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.120]   And I think I can argue it both sides right now,
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:13.000]   and we don't have a very clear answer yet.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.520]   The first side is if you take a step back
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.560]   and ask from an evolutionary perspective,
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.200]   let's assume for want of a better word,
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.160]   that lucid dreaming is helpful, it's meaningful,
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.200]   and that we should engage in it.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.120]   If that's the case,
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.180]   that it confers some type of evolutionary benefit,
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:36.720]   then you would expect that a lot of people
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.300]   would be doing it.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.760]   But if you look at the statistics,
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.760]   somewhere between maybe just 10 to 20% of the population
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.480]   are natural lucid dreamers.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.480]   And so from an evolutionary perspective,
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.960]   I could say, well, if it was so powerful,
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:55.720]   it was so meaningful 'cause we know everyone sleeps.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:56.640]   And for the most part,
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.980]   we can say that almost everyone dreams.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:03.820]   If that's the case, then those must clearly serve a purpose.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.360]   But the fact that very few people are lucid dreamers,
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.520]   doesn't that tell us that it isn't necessarily beneficial?
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.960]   So from that perspective, I can play those numbers.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.960]   There is an inherent flaw in my argument there, however,
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.540]   because that assumes based on the argument
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:27.200]   I've just given you, that we have stopped evolving.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.100]   And of course we have not.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:33.300]   And so perhaps that 10 to 10 to 20% of the population
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.180]   who are natural lucid dreamers
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:39.340]   are at the forefront of hominid evolution.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.060]   And they're the next super rate,
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.380]   we shouldn't be worried about AI,
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:46.220]   we should be worried about the lucid dreams
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:48.380]   'cause they're gonna come and take over the world.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:51.120]   So I can argue it from that perspective,
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.940]   which is just a philosophical argument.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.340]   It doesn't have weighted data to it,
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.740]   but there is some data.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:01.280]   Some individuals have asked the question,
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.140]   is there any changes to your sleep
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:07.380]   or even the benefits of sleep
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.980]   when you are a lucid dreamer versus not?
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.040]   And what's interesting is that for some papers
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.000]   that have been published,
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.540]   after nights when people report lucid dreaming,
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.940]   they wake up and they don't feel as restored.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:23.100]   They don't feel as refreshed by their sleep in the morning,
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.460]   suggesting just as you sort of hinted at there,
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:29.520]   that the lucid dreaming state is associated
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   with perhaps a less deep or more shallow form of REM sleep
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.420]   or a more active state of REM sleep, perhaps too active,
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:42.180]   so that it's fatiguing and depleting.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:45.540]   And upon awakening, you don't get that memory
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.740]   and that body, that brain and body reset.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.940]   There are, however, a few papers
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:55.060]   that have not found that result.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.180]   So I think right now we don't truly know
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:01.700]   if the lucid state is associated with unrefreshing sleep
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:02.980]   and unrestorative sleep.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.360]   But if that proves true,
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.740]   then I think that that's one argument.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.400]   The other argument I would put forward against it
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.300]   from that perspective would be,
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.420]   think about what we've said
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.820]   regarding the functions of dreaming, memory processing,
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:19.060]   but particularly emotional therapy
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.140]   to gift us mental health.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:26.700]   If we then come along and say, presumably,
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.780]   nature through millions of years of evolution
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.820]   has come up with this blueprint manifesto
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.340]   of exactly what should be served up
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.340]   on the dream menu this evening.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.820]   There's a reason for that.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:48.660]   And that reason has been sculpted over millions of years
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   to become wonderfully optimal for us
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.500]   and our emotional mental health.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.460]   And then we come along in the space of a lifetime,
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.680]   and perhaps you could argue a little bit humoristically,
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.500]   we think, I perhaps know a little bit better
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.740]   than a couple of million years of evolution.
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:10.280]   I'm going to push those things off the rank ordering chart
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.420]   of what gets served up into my dreams.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:14.140]   And I'm going to supersede that
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:18.660]   and decide what I would prefer to be dreaming about.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.380]   And again, I think that there's no good evidence
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.260]   that you could argue that that isn't true,
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.820]   but equally that it is true.
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.700]   We just don't know yet.
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.980]   If that is the case that lucid dreaming
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:34.000]   does produce unrestorative sleep,
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.420]   in some ways, it also begs the question,
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.060]   well, what is happening in your brain during lucid dreaming?
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.900]   Is there anything in your brain
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:45.140]   that would explain why you don't feel refreshed?
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:48.380]   And early studies looking at lucid dreamers
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.540]   when we put them inside of a brain scanner,
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:52.820]   I told you at the start of this episode,
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.780]   dream sleep has a unique brain signature.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.380]   Memory regions, emotion regions,
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   motor regions and visual regions, they're all lighting up.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:04.020]   But then there's this one part of your brain
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:04.940]   that does the opposite,
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:08.060]   which is the lateral left and right sides
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.500]   of your prefrontal cortex.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.140]   The logical, rational thinking,
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:16.740]   controlling regions of your brain, those go offline.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.700]   But early studies demonstrated that the activity
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:22.060]   and including the electrical activity
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.380]   over those frontal regions would be down
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:28.480]   as you were in non-lucid dreaming.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.980]   But then when people rise back up and said,
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.520]   now I'm lucid dreaming with those leftward flicks,
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.000]   that activity was brought back online,
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:41.100]   which makes a lot of mechanistic sense,
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.460]   which is all of a sudden the part of your brain
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.300]   that prevented you from having rational logical control
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.900]   has been re-engaged.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:53.420]   And as a consequence, you yourself can re-engage
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.460]   in volitional dictation of the outcome
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.660]   of what you're dreaming.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:03.500]   Some studies, however, have not replicated that finding
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.180]   because when they looked at it and they took out
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:09.940]   some sort of what we call these covariates
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.900]   or these confounding factors,
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:15.140]   and I can bore you with what that principally is,
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.020]   it removed that result.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.300]   And all of a sudden the prefrontal cortex
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:23.280]   went back to seemingly being non-active.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.260]   They did find an alternate result.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.580]   What they found is that the electrical activity
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:31.780]   of the brain, when you go into a lucid dreaming state,
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:35.740]   seems to be a bit more frenetic, a bit more active
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.820]   versus non-lucid dreaming states
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.740]   of electrical brain activity.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.760]   And if that's the case, if the cortex,
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.500]   which is already active,
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:48.200]   is forced to become even more frenetically active
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.040]   when you are in this lucid dream state,
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.260]   is that part of the reason that when you wake up
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.140]   from the lucid dreaming and you go about your day,
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.100]   your brain just doesn't seem to be at the same
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.700]   operating ability because it's being fatigued
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:04.540]   above and beyond.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.620]   It's like saying I do a standard workout
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:11.620]   and I always go to one or two reps before failure.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.580]   But now as I'm lucid dreaming,
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:17.740]   I am constantly going to complete muscle failure.
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:21.220]   And then the next few days, if you go and do a workout,
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.540]   and I've been listening, you and I have been trading workouts
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.580]   I don't want to do an Andrew Huberman workout.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.440]   Trust me, you are, this man is.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.220]   - Mine are short and sweet.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:32.080]   - I'm, well, we'll work out at some point together,
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.380]   but it's almost as though then no big surprise
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.840]   that after you do a legs day,
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.460]   if I were to wake you up the next day
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.820]   and say you're back doing legs,
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.660]   you say I can't do that, I'm toast, I'm hosed,
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:45.260]   my legs are done.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.860]   And that's what we think could perhaps explain
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.280]   why you get that fatigue.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.860]   Does that make some sense?
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.980]   - Makes very good sense.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.240]   And in the absence of better language to put to it,
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:59.300]   I've long thought that one of the best things about sleep
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.720]   is that we are not engaging our frontal cortex
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.400]   that much in sleep.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.760]   And as we talked about in an earlier episode,
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.080]   the frontal cortex during waking is responsible for things
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.640]   such as the suppression of reflexes.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.680]   I mean, it has to do that
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.800]   according to context of a situation.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.180]   It's a lot of work.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.800]   And the frontal cortex does a great number
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:22.920]   of other things as well.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.000]   But I think one of the most wonderful things about sleep
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.700]   is that we get release and a break
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:34.860]   from all of that analysis of duration, path, and outcome.
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:35.980]   How long is something gonna take?
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.880]   What path do I need to take in order to get there?
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:38.940]   What's the outcome going to be?
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.660]   All that analysis of things past, present, and future,
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:44.380]   it's work, it's mental work.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.900]   And I think that if you tell me,
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:47.820]   and I think you just did,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.820]   that lucid dreaming involves any kind of encroachment
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:56.280]   of duration, path, outcome type of analysis into my sleep,
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.440]   my personal preference is going to be to not lucid dream.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:02.160]   I'd rather just have very robust,
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.480]   perhaps dreams of different kinds
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.560]   and try and make sense of them once I wake up.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.280]   - It's so tempting though, isn't it?
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.440]   Because like you, I've had those experiences.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.240]   I remember an amazing dream where I was snowboarding
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.140]   and I am a below average snowboarder.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.360]   And all of a sudden I was just taking jumps
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.960]   and I was doing all sorts of X game.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.040]   - You're Shaun White.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:30.240]   - I was, and it was unbelievable.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.840]   And I felt so, and I was so happy in the moment.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.640]   And I remember waking up and just thinking,
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.220]   firstly, I'm sad I'm waking up.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:43.360]   And second, that was sublime.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.160]   And all I want to do tomorrow night is go back
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.600]   and now I'm gonna switch my snowboard out for a dirt bike
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.720]   and I'm gonna do the dirt bike X games version of it.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.140]   I'm gonna be doing all sorts of Superman.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:56.780]   - Can't get greedy with mother nature.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.620]   - I know, I know.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.440]   - She body slams you.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.280]   - So I get it.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.540]   I know if people out there are enjoying it
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.280]   or wanting to do that.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.820]   And by the way, I didn't answer,
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.140]   I'm so sorry, your red light question,
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.900]   which is, if you wanted to do it, how can you do it
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.140]   if you're not doing it already?
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.380]   There are in fact two scientific methods
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.660]   that have been developed.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:22.200]   One of them actually has a vague whiff
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.520]   of relationship to the light device.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.920]   Although that's one of those things where if,
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.960]   you know, if a friend sent it to me or a random person said,
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.320]   oh, Dr. Walker, I've seen this in the back of a magazine,
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.880]   how do you think it works?
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.880]   I would just say, please go and spend your $199
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:39.720]   on something that is going to be--
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.220]   - Yeah, I think I was about 11 or 12 years old.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.660]   I think it costs something like 1099 or something,
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.280]   which at the time for me was a lot of money,
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.880]   but I had a paper route back then
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.600]   and I had a little bit of a dispensable income,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.360]   but it was cool 'cause it was probably
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.880]   one of my first experiments.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.480]   I've been running experiments since I was a kid,
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.000]   but I think self-experimentation can be fun.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.520]   - Oh, it's great, and you can see that.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.460]   But sorry, coming back to your red light,
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:08.160]   the two methods, one of them is something called
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.040]   the MILD technique, which stands for
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.040]   the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming, M-I-L-D.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:19.720]   Mnemonic just meaning a memory-based technique.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.320]   Induction, obviously what we're trying to induce something,
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.160]   and what is it?
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.000]   We're trying to induce lucid dreaming.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.540]   And it's a very simple technique,
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:31.760]   which is that you consistently rehearse before bed
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.400]   this notion that I will remember my dreams
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.280]   and I will instigate control in my dreams.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.920]   And you do this, and it sounds just so hokey
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.420]   and non-scientific.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.840]   Sure enough, you do this over and over again,
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.720]   the probability that you will lucid dream increases.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.480]   I think the better one, maybe the more effective one,
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.440]   is called the Reality Testing Method.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.020]   And it was probably made famous in a brilliant movie.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.040]   If you haven't seen it, everyone should watch it.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.240]   It's called "Waking Life."
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:10.240]   And it is an amazing, Richard Linklater, the director,
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.120]   just for the philosophy alone in it,
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.960]   it will blow your mind.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.000]   It's exceptional, but it's a beautiful treatise
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.320]   on dreaming and lucid dreaming.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:25.840]   And in that, they describe a method
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.440]   where during the waking day, you are constantly,
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.240]   perhaps you can set an alarm,
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.720]   and you're constantly reminded to go over to,
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.560]   let's say the wall, and flip the light switch on and off,
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.460]   on and off, on and off.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.680]   And sure enough, what happens?
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.780]   The lights go on and off.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.440]   Why? Because it's the real world,
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.140]   and it complies and it's complicit with the laws of physics.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.600]   So you do this time and time again,
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:52.080]   and you start to train yourself that at unique moments
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.220]   throughout your waking experience,
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.320]   you always go over and you test some version of reality,
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320]   or it could just be,
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.040]   I'm going to press my hand into something solid,
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.280]   and this table is resisting my hand right now
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.940]   as I'm pressing it, and I just keep doing that.
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:09.560]   And then at some point, it becomes routine enough
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.440]   that you start to do that same thing when you are dreaming.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.320]   But now, when I press my hand against the table
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.700]   or press my hand against the wall,
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:20.160]   my hand goes straight through the wall,
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.320]   or I flip the light switch on and off,
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.640]   and the lights do nothing.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.880]   And all of a sudden, that's my cue to say,
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.200]   I'm not awake, am I?
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.020]   I'm dreaming.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:35.080]   And therefore, at that point, I gain lucidity,
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.160]   and it increases the probability.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.080]   So those are the two methods that people have used.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.960]   And statistically, scientifically,
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.940]   they do seem to have some degree of success.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.720]   - I love it.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.540]   I love it.
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.920]   I personally am going to opt to not encourage lucid dreaming
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.540]   because I'm, and myself,
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:56.560]   because I'm working on getting my sleep deeper and longer
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.120]   through the night with fewer waking episodes.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:00.960]   - We will get there.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:01.840]   Do not worry. - We will get there.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.880]   Using the tools described in the previous
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.000]   and this episode of the series that we're doing here.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   My sleep's been excellent at times,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   pretty good at other times, and lousy at others,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.080]   which I think makes me well-qualified
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.320]   to talk about tools for sleep
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.480]   because I feel like I've come at it
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.920]   from every level of performance.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.760]   - Very much.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.360]   And by the way, shield and sword in hand,
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.640]   I'm right there by your side.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.120]   We'll make it happen.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:26.960]   Don't worry.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.000]   - Well, thank you, truly.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.720]   Okay, so sadly, we are nearing the end
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.040]   of this six-episode series,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.020]   and here we are in the sixth episode.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.600]   However, last night, before leaving the studio,
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.040]   I decided to put out a word on social media
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.720]   on X, aka Twitter, and on Instagram,
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.840]   asking people what questions they have about sleep.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.280]   And I made it very broadband.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.160]   You know, I said, "Ask anything you want about sleep.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.640]   "Matt Walker will do his best to answer."
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.280]   And of course, we had thousands and thousands
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.240]   and thousands of questions. - You did great.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.080]   - And we're grateful for-
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.920]   - Let's push on through till dawn,
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:09.680]   which completely violates every one of the six episodes.
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:10.520]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:11.840]   - They'll benefit, we'll struggle.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:16.200]   However, we were able to bin those responses
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.600]   into most frequently asked,
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.560]   most frequently liked, et cetera.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.240]   And so, while we can't ask every question of you,
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.760]   what I thought would be fun
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.680]   and very informative for the listeners
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.560]   is to ask 10 of the most popular questions.
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.040]   - Fingers on buzzers, no conferring, here we go.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.240]   - And these are questions for which
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.320]   I think there are practical answers.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.080]   And so, we'll do this, not in rapid fire Q&A,
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.120]   but in, let's just say, a bridged format.
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.040]   And then, perhaps, we have you back another time
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.340]   to answer more of the questions.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.840]   Before we get into these questions,
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.520]   I will say that many of the questions that were asked
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   by the audience in those comments
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:03.480]   were, in fact, answered in the earlier five episodes
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.560]   of this podcast series with Matt Walker,
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:09.000]   as well as the one that we held today
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.800]   on dreams and lucid dreaming.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.160]   So, if you don't hear the answer to these,
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.560]   to your question here, and you have a burning question,
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.600]   chances are your question was answered
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.760]   in a previous episode.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.160]   And all of those episodes are timestamped
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.800]   in a lot of detail, so people can navigate quickly
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.920]   to the topics most of interest to them.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:32.620]   So, without further ado, questions from the audience.
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.580]   First question is about best practices
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:40.100]   for managing rumination and negative thoughts
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.340]   when trying to fall asleep.
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:43.740]   Meaning, if somebody is ruminating
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:44.860]   and they're having negative thoughts
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:46.020]   when they're trying to fall asleep,
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:49.260]   what should they do in order to get past that
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.500]   and fall asleep?
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.020]   - Short-circuit.
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.740]   You need to short-circuit that situation.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.200]   And the way that you can do that
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.780]   is through a variety of methods.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:02.180]   There are multiple methods for short-circuiting rumination.
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.540]   The first I would recommend,
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:06.580]   and it's something I practice, meditation.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.660]   But really, all of these that I'll describe
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.500]   are about getting your mind off itself.
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:14.300]   That's the biggest problem regarding anxiety
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:16.420]   and sleep onset insomnia,
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:19.440]   which is what I think this person is describing.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.100]   So, meditation allows you, it's either guided
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.300]   and you're speaking about what you should be doing
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:30.100]   with your breathing or relaxation guided meditations.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.220]   All of those stop your mind
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.980]   from being able to play on itself
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.700]   and go through that Rolodex of anxiety.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.740]   You can do breathing techniques.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:42.860]   You can listen to sleep stories.
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.500]   You can do your own type of body scan.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.360]   Anything that you can do, and something we described,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.800]   which seems to be a quite effective method,
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:52.960]   is taking yourself on a mental walk.
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.260]   Close your eyes.
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:57.220]   And a walk that you know intensely well
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:00.180]   with vivid 4K detail.
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:02.900]   Replicate that to the letter.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.940]   I left foot on the first step, down the steps,
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:09.980]   take a right at the driveway, up I go, walk up the hill,
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.620]   look to the left, the bay is out there.
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.120]   It's 5 p.m., the sun is starting to set.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.100]   That level of detail.
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:20.180]   And usually when you do any one of these things,
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.320]   the next thing that you remember
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:24.140]   is that you're waking up in the morning
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:27.660]   because you are able to short circuit.
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:29.500]   That would be the best advice.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:30.340]   - Terrific.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:31.380]   And I must say the other night,
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.940]   I woke up in the middle of the night
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:35.320]   and was having a little bit of trouble falling back asleep.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:36.980]   And I used this mental walk approach
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.420]   and it worked very, very well.
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:40.260]   So thank you.
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:43.460]   The next question is,
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.460]   what is the best position to sleep in?
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.560]   Best body position.
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:51.700]   Best body position is probably the absence of the worst.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.900]   That would be your back.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.900]   And it's ill-advised mostly for people who snore.
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:00.960]   When you are on your back,
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.340]   the likelihood of you snoring
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.580]   and that airway collapsing entirely
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:08.140]   and you having what's called a hypoxic event
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.500]   where you stop breathing entirely
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.180]   is significantly higher than if you sleep on your side
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.760]   or on your front.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:18.220]   So I would say that for most people,
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:20.040]   if you know that you don't snore,
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.440]   if your partner says, I don't hear you snoring,
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.300]   that's partial confirmation that you do not snore.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.580]   If you are curious and everyone should be,
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:31.440]   everyone should be curious as to whether they snore.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.220]   I would say, download an app and we can link to it.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.900]   I have no affiliation with whatsoever.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:37.980]   I pay my money.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.580]   I think it's like pennies on the dollar.
[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:41.820]   I can say $2 a month or something.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:43.980]   And it is called Snore Lab.
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:47.460]   So the word snore and then L-A-B.
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:49.380]   And you download it and it's an app.
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.620]   And it is something that you install on your phone.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:55.940]   And then you say, start recording
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.680]   and you place your phone face down
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.700]   and it listens to you all night.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.260]   And it records your breathing, nothing more.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.460]   Can't know what you're doing or saying.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.280]   Don't worry, there's privacy.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.220]   But it assesses your breathing.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.540]   And then it will show you a distribution
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.500]   of your snoring throughout the night.
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:18.420]   And it categorizes that snoring from quiet, no snoring
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:22.140]   to mild snoring, to moderate, to epic.
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:25.220]   And it literally is like a Richter shock.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:29.980]   And you will see very clearly if you are snoring or not.
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:33.700]   Worse still and impactful most is that you can go
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.140]   to those spikes when you are snoring and you can replay it.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:39.700]   And it is quite frightening
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:42.980]   to hear yourself struggling for breath.
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:45.980]   If you see a confirmation of snoring
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:49.780]   by way of that SnoreLab, go and see your doctor.
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:51.460]   That is the best advice.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:55.380]   80% of people who have sleep apnea or snoring
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.620]   or in cessation of breathing are undiagnosed right now.
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:00.820]   And it will take years off your life.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:03.780]   And when you get treated, it is transformational.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.600]   Patient once told me when I got treated
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.980]   with my Sleep App device, I felt like I was 10 years younger.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.100]   It was almost as though,
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:14.140]   and I'll remember it to the day I die.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.540]   It was almost as though someone came along
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.580]   and wiped a fogged glass clear.
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:22.900]   And I could finally see that was the transformation.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.840]   So my advice is if you think you are snoring,
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.640]   stay away from back sleeping.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.740]   - From sleeping on your back.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.140]   - From sleeping on your back.
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:33.420]   And even if you don't suspect you are a snorer,
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.260]   just download this app.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.660]   You get a couple of nights for free.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.900]   Just do it for a couple of nights consistently.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:41.100]   And then ask also, by the way, if you take on board alcohol
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:44.260]   and you have mild snoring, it is very clear.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:47.100]   I would be highly surprised if on the nights that you drink,
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.660]   you don't get a significant increase
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.820]   in your score of snoring.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.660]   - Terrific.
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:57.260]   The next question is, why does my body wake up at 3.30 AM?
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.020]   And I'm presuming their mind as well,
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:01.620]   no matter what time I go to sleep.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.860]   - So to that question,
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.700]   and we will have spoken about this before,
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:10.340]   my first response is, how do you know it's 3.30?
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.540]   And their response is, because I look at the clock,
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.100]   that's the first problem.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:17.740]   Take all clock faces away from your site
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:18.900]   when you are sleeping.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.260]   It is only going to reinforce it.
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:24.140]   The second is that 3.30 can sometimes,
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.860]   or if it's a consistent time,
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.500]   there's no sort of special thing about 3.30,
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.220]   it's just for this person.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:33.580]   People wake up at very specific times, quite reliably so.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.260]   Part of that is because they're going through
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:37.780]   very reliably timed sleep cycles.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:42.100]   And every time we finish a REM sleep period, we wake up.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.500]   But it's normally very brief.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.060]   And the reason is because we've been in paralysis
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:47.820]   and the body needs to move.
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:50.540]   So we wake up, we make a postural shift,
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:52.180]   we move in our bed just slightly,
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.620]   and then we go back to sleep.
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:54.820]   It happens to us all.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:58.060]   For some of us, we will wake up and then we will stay awake.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:01.340]   And that's why it seems to be so religiously timed
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.460]   to certain specific moments in our night.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:07.220]   But this other sort of individual mentioned,
[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:09.380]   no matter what time I go to bed,
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.620]   I seem to always wake up there.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.500]   That to me smells of a suggestion of reinforced learning,
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.540]   that you've woken up a couple of times,
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.100]   you've checked the clock,
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.060]   and now you have taught your brain very quickly
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:27.060]   that I always wake up at 3.30 in the morning.
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.180]   And lo and behold, what happens is that
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:31.180]   you start to do that more frequently.
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:32.900]   The more frequently it happens,
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:34.220]   the more times that you check,
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:36.580]   the stronger that memory association becomes,
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:38.700]   the more likely it is to happen.
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.660]   Remove the clock face from the bed, room.
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:45.100]   - Terrific.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:48.500]   Can we bank sleep or catch up on lost sleep?
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:52.220]   - It's a great question.
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:55.860]   You can and you cannot bank sleep.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:58.140]   And it is directional.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:01.020]   So what we found is that for certain things,
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:05.780]   such as, let's say, an immune vaccination
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:07.580]   or learning and memory,
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.220]   if you are sleep deprived,
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:13.820]   let's say the night after learning a specific task,
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:15.940]   and lots of people have done this.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.340]   So you are deprived the first night after learning.
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:21.140]   And that first night we know is critical
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:23.340]   for consolidating and saving those memories.
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.820]   But then the next day,
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:27.820]   I don't test you in the way I would normally do.
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:30.420]   Instead, I give you a full recovery night of sleep,
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.660]   or maybe I give you two full recovery nights of sleep,
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.260]   and then I test you.
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:39.780]   Do you show any evidence of a memory consolidation benefit?
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.060]   And the answer is no, you don't.
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:42.900]   In other words,
[01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:46.300]   if you don't sleep the first night after learning,
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:49.740]   you lose the chance to consolidate those memories.
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:51.300]   So there, sleep in that sense
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:53.060]   is an all or nothing phenomenon.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:55.780]   If you don't snooze, you lose in that regard.
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:59.380]   And there are other examples of that downstairs in the body.
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:04.060]   That is what happens when you go into a debt,
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.940]   and then you try to pay it back with later credit,
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.500]   and it fails.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.180]   You can't seem to do that with sleep.
[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:12.020]   So in that sense,
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.540]   sleep is not like the bank in that direction.
[02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.260]   You can't accumulate a debt.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:17.540]   And then let's say at the weekend
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.340]   after short sleeping during the week,
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:21.020]   see if you can pay off that debt
[02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:22.180]   at some later point in time.
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.660]   It doesn't work like that.
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.500]   So for example,
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:27.180]   if I deprive you, Andrew Huberman, of sleep tonight,
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.860]   let's say it's an eight-hour opportunity,
[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.420]   and then tomorrow I give you
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:33.700]   all of the recovery sleep that you want,
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.980]   and then on a second night, third night, fourth night,
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.020]   do you sleep longer those subsequent nights?
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.500]   Yes, you do.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:42.380]   But you only sleep back about 50%,
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:44.460]   about four extra hours.
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.300]   In fact, if you look at the data, it's usually less.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.460]   It's usually around two.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:51.300]   So only about 25% of the eight hours that you lost.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.020]   So you are always running a debt.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.260]   And if that's the case,
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:58.740]   if you can't truly pay back your sleep debt,
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:01.820]   and you're constantly running that short sleep cycle,
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.900]   you are, it's like compounding interest on the loan.
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.060]   It just escalates dramatically.
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:08.340]   And that's why I think we see
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:12.780]   that short sleep really does predict ill health outcomes
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:17.780]   and early mortality the later and later in life that you go.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:22.020]   However, there is a different form of sleep banking.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:25.020]   I told you that here you're going into a debt
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:28.180]   and you're trying to pay it off with credit later.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.700]   What if you had the inverse?
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:34.300]   Let's say that you are a doctor or a nurse,
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:38.100]   or you are working in the emergency services.
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:40.820]   And you know that you have two nights
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.020]   where you're on nights
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:44.820]   and you're going to be probably very busy.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.860]   And you're not going to be sleeping well
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:48.900]   for the next two nights.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.220]   And that's going to be next Monday and Tuesday.
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.580]   And I'm currently on Wednesday in the week prior.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:56.820]   There is something that has been demonstrated
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.220]   called sleep banking,
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:01.380]   which is where I know I'm going to go into debt.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:06.220]   So I sleep longer and I create credit to begin with.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:09.780]   And then I spend that credit as I go into debt.
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:13.500]   And it seems to lessen the impact of that debt.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:16.180]   It doesn't remove the impact entirely,
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:17.620]   but it does lessen it.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.580]   So here it's the inverse.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:20.980]   I'm not going into debt
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:23.900]   and then trying to pay it off later.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.580]   I build up credit
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:27.780]   and then I can spend that credit with debt.
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.380]   So there is a form of sleep banking
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.900]   that seems to be present,
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:34.820]   but it's not the sleep banking that most people think about.
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.580]   Does that make, I know it's very confusing,
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:37.420]   but I tried to be clear about that.
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:38.500]   - No, I think you made it very clear
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:41.540]   that you can buffer some of the sleep loss
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:43.140]   that you anticipate,
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:48.380]   but there's no retroactive saving of what you lost.
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:49.220]   - That's right.
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:51.940]   - What are some of the best practices
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.380]   for getting back to sleep
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.300]   after waking up in the middle of the night?
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:59.700]   - There, I would say there are several things.
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:04.060]   First, don't try too hard
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:08.580]   because trying to get back to sleep
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.260]   and become frustrated
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.140]   is very much like trying to remember someone's name.
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:15.100]   Sleep is just like this,
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.100]   that the harder you try,
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.940]   the further you push it away.
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:22.580]   And as soon as you stop,
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:27.260]   all of a sudden that name just pops back into your head.
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:29.700]   And it's the same way with sleep.
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:31.180]   Now, previously I've said,
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:34.620]   you don't want to spend a lot of time awake in bed
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.540]   because you learn the association
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.420]   that your bed is the place of wakefulness.
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.660]   And every time you come in at night,
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.940]   you're always wide awake and you don't know why,
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.820]   despite having fallen asleep watching television
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:47.660]   just 20 minutes earlier.
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:50.940]   The other suggestion, however,
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:54.100]   is most people don't want to get out of bed.
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:55.460]   It's dark, it's cold.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:56.980]   I get it, I understand it.
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:00.620]   The other thing to do in this situation
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:04.340]   is enjoy the concept of rest.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:05.940]   So wouldn't it be wonderful
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:08.060]   if in the middle of your working day,
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:11.380]   someone said, look, just come away from your desk now.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.900]   And here is a beautiful, calm bedroom.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:18.380]   It smells very nice, nice, dim light.
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:20.380]   I would let you to lie down.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.300]   No need to fall asleep, don't fall asleep.
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:27.140]   Just lie down on the bed or on the couch and just rest
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:29.740]   for the next 30 or 40 minutes.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:33.420]   Just have a wonderful, good old rest.
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:34.700]   That sounds lovely.
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.980]   And if you are struggling to fall back asleep
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.740]   and you've listened to me
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.580]   and the idiocy of what I've been describing
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:43.340]   over the past six episodes,
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:45.340]   you could start to get very stressed and say,
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.820]   gosh, well, sleep is doing this and this and this
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.220]   and I'm now and it's been 20 minutes and I can't fall back.
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:53.260]   You just get more and more stressed.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.380]   Instead, take a different approach at that point.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:59.300]   Instead of, if all the techniques that we've spoken about,
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.860]   getting your mind off itself and we list them just now
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.540]   and we've listed them in a previous episode,
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:08.660]   if none of those are working and you just can't catch it,
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:11.260]   don't worry, just say to yourself, you know what?
[02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:12.660]   Tonight is not my night.
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:14.380]   And he told me it's okay.
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:17.100]   And it really is, it's fine.
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:19.540]   Tomorrow night is going to be a better night.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:22.180]   Tonight instead, rather than trying to force myself
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.940]   to sleep, I'm just going to lie here,
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:28.020]   maybe with my eyes open, I'm just gonna rest.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.900]   I'm just gonna enjoy and not stress.
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:33.740]   I'm just gonna enjoy a good old rest in my bed.
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:37.340]   And once again, the next thing that happens
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:40.060]   is that the sun has emerged.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:43.180]   It's bright in your room, despite the blackout curtains
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:44.700]   and your alarm is going off
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:48.780]   because as soon as you relaxed out of the state of trying,
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:52.240]   sleep came back in a resplendent way.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.060]   - Terrific.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:58.180]   Someone asks, "I used to be a great sleeper,
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:05:59.660]   but as I've gotten older,"
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:02.880]   and then they mentioned that they're 65 currently,
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:06.420]   "I find that I wake up much earlier than I did previously.
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:08.220]   And it's difficult for me to get more
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:09.860]   than six hours of sleep."
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:12.800]   What do you think is going on and what are some remedies?
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:16.400]   - The first question I would want to ask is,
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.140]   how do you feel on six hours of sleep?
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:19.620]   And we can go from there.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:22.700]   If you are impaired and you're struggling during the day
[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:24.680]   and this person sounds as though they are unhappy
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:25.860]   with that six hours,
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.460]   then we can start to have a conversation.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:29.580]   What would that conversation sound like?
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.560]   I want to understand perhaps the reason
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.020]   that you can't get back asleep.
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.780]   And we'll begin these techniques that we've spoken about
[02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:37.400]   for trying to get back to sleep.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.620]   Let's say that you've gone to bed at 10
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:41.720]   and you normally would like to wake up at six,
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:43.460]   but you're always waking up at four.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:45.880]   And there's just nothing you can do at that stage.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.340]   You just don't feel the sleepiness over you,
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.700]   weighing you down.
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:52.180]   And there's no amount of these methods
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:53.020]   are going to help you.
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:54.460]   You just have to get up.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:56.580]   We see this a lot in older adults.
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:59.580]   Sleep late in the night is very fragile,
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:01.980]   much greater probability of them waking up
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:04.620]   in the second half of the night and the last quarter.
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:08.460]   It's also miserable because most older adults,
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.900]   their circadian rhythm shifts earlier.
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:13.140]   I told you that as we go through our teen years,
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:15.460]   our circadian rhythm shifts,
[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:17.900]   it gets sort of pushed into the future.
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:20.820]   And we like to go to bed much later and wake up much later.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:24.220]   And then into older adult sort of interval adulthood,
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.740]   it drags back a little bit and we find our sweet spot.
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:28.380]   But then as we get older,
[02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:30.540]   it starts to regress back to what happened
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:31.660]   when we were children.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:33.780]   We want to stay up late, but we can't.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.580]   We go to bed so early and we wake up early.
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.940]   Some regression happens as we get older.
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:40.420]   By the way, it's the reason that there is
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:42.960]   the quote unquote early bird special in Florida,
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:44.420]   where a lot of people retire.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:46.820]   It's the early bird special because most people are to bed
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:49.740]   by 9 p.m. and they want to be eating,
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:51.860]   starting to eat at 4 p.m.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:54.220]   So how do you deal with that?
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:57.540]   One way is you can use one of the four methods,
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:00.780]   the four sort of macros of good sleep that we spoke about,
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:04.140]   QQRT, quantity, quality, regularity, timing.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.460]   Here I would say,
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:09.180]   see if you can delay your bedtime as best you can.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:12.100]   If your bedtime is 10 and you would like,
[02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:13.540]   and you're normally waking up at six,
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:15.340]   but you're consistently waking up at four,
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:18.780]   start trying to go to bed at 11 p.m.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:22.540]   Push, push, push as hard as you can
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:25.260]   until you are so sleepy, you sleep.
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:28.260]   And then it will take a couple of days
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.860]   to build up that sort of remembering
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:33.540]   from your brain and the debt that to begin with,
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.300]   you'll go to bed now at 11 and you'll wake up at four again
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:37.960]   and things are even worse.
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.060]   But after a while, you're building up this pressure to sleep
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.900]   and all of a sudden you're going to bed again at 11,
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:46.700]   but your brain thinks I have had four nights
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.920]   of now just five hours of sleep.
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:51.180]   I'm not doing this anymore.
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:53.540]   I'm gonna sleep through until five.
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:56.380]   And you can keep moving your schedule later
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:58.460]   because when older adults are waking up at four
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:00.340]   and they can't get back, it's also miserable
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:02.580]   because the rest of the world is asleep
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:04.540]   and the people they want to engage with,
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:07.780]   have a social life, you know, call the kids,
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:10.180]   speak with their grandkids, they can't do any of that.
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:12.500]   So it's a very difficult situation.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.020]   If those things don't work,
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.460]   you can also speak to a board certified
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:18.220]   sleep medicine clinician.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:20.940]   CBTI, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:23.380]   which we've spoken about in this episode,
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:25.320]   is also effective for older adults
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.780]   to help them stay asleep.
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.580]   If that doesn't work and you don't like to think
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:31.020]   about a psychological treatment,
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.800]   there are some medications.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.940]   People think I'm probably a bit anti-medication
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:39.520]   because I've been very vocal about classic sleeping pills.
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.980]   But there are some sleeping medications
[02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:42.220]   that I think do show promise.
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.100]   I'm not anti-pharmacology by any means.
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.180]   One of them that's been shown to be effective
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.180]   for older adults is something called doxepin.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:54.140]   And trazodone too, although there is some sort of pushback
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:56.300]   a little bit by the community against trazodone,
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:58.300]   and there's a new class of drugs that we've spoken about
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:00.540]   in a previous episode called the DORAS,
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:05.540]   the dual orexin receptor antagonists, D-O-R-A small S.
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.680]   So I've spoken about three there,
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:11.080]   trazodone, doxepin, the DORAS.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.320]   By the way, I'm a scientist, not a medical doctor.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.920]   This is scientifically descriptive,
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.160]   not medically prescriptive.
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:19.860]   Trazodone has perhaps been used more so,
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:22.600]   if anything, to help people who struggle to fall asleep.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:24.240]   Doxepin, if you look at the data,
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.080]   is a medication that's much more helpful
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:29.120]   for keeping people asleep and including,
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.360]   and especially it seems for older adults.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.560]   And there it's lower dose doxepin.
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.240]   I think if you look at the data,
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:39.100]   three milligrams and six milligram doses
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:40.460]   have been effective.
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:41.660]   You can get it in pill form,
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:43.700]   although usually not in those doses.
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.660]   And you have to end up cutting pills in half
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:47.460]   because it comes in 12 milligrams.
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:50.780]   There is a liquid solution that is provided.
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.980]   And there, I think the standard dose starts
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:54.860]   at around half a milliliter.
[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:58.260]   So you get a little syringe and it's a one millimeter syringe
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:02.420]   and you suck up that half a milliliter.
[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:03.860]   And then you just put it in a drink
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:05.480]   in the last half an hour before bed.
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.560]   It's tasteless and it helps you stay asleep.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:12.260]   So there are a variety of different things you can do.
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:15.540]   Just go try for rest and just give yourself the chance,
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:17.680]   push your bed to a later time point.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.720]   You can also try cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:22.800]   and you can speak with your physician
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.520]   about some sleep medications.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:25.780]   - Terrific.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:27.000]   There were a good number of people
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.960]   that asked about sleep and menopause.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.860]   One question was, "Since entering menopause,
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:37.100]   "I have not gotten a good night's sleep in years."
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.900]   I think this question dovetails with the previous question.
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.980]   I mean, it could be age-related, right?
[02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:44.320]   Could be directly related to menopause.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:50.300]   So are you aware of any specific treatments
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:54.540]   that you haven't covered in the course of this Q&A
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:56.080]   that are unique to menopause?
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.420]   I think the answer you just gave
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:02.960]   to whoever asked the question about how to get more sleep
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:05.320]   or better sleep as one has gotten older
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.180]   should probably handle the answer to this question.
[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:12.180]   But what of the menopause specific requirements
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.540]   for getting better sleep?
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:19.000]   - It is a huge problem in premenopausal
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.040]   and perimenopausal women,
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.920]   and of course, women going through menopause.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:25.600]   It's principally because of what we call
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.000]   the vasomotor symptoms of menopause,
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.660]   which is to say these hot flashes
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.320]   where you just get sort of really, for the body at least,
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:37.740]   quite extreme increases in temperature.
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:41.500]   You get so hot, and don't forget in our episode two,
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.640]   we spoke about how you need to regulate temperature,
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:47.240]   and there's a very beautiful and complex relationship
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:48.820]   between temperature and sleep.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:51.760]   And we said you need to stay cool to stay asleep.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.320]   But here is a situation where when you're asleep,
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.400]   you're not staying cool, you're doing the opposite.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:57.600]   You're getting warm,
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:01.180]   and that is the adversarial thermal situation
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.560]   for staying asleep.
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:04.360]   And so individuals wake up,
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:06.560]   and then they struggle to get back to sleep.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.240]   I would say, and we know the reasons why, too,
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:12.880]   some of the other issues with sleep are problematic.
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.480]   It has to do with some of the sex hormone changes.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:19.360]   And I think I myself have released a podcast
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.440]   on this specific issue,
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:23.720]   and I won't go into the mechanisms as to why.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:25.680]   I'll speak about the treatments.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:28.520]   One treatment which is non-medication-based
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:30.480]   is trying to make your bedroom cool,
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:33.800]   but also using these smart mattresses.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:37.560]   Now, I've spoken to Matteo, the CEO of Eight Sleep,
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.440]   another fantastic product,
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:42.800]   and he has had a huge amount of feedback
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:46.200]   from menopausal women saying that that cooling mattress
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.800]   has been very helpful for their vasomotor symptoms.
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:50.960]   So that's one method you can go down.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.760]   The other is a medication method.
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.960]   And here I need to be very careful.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.960]   I'm going to speak about bio-identical hormone
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.560]   replacement therapy for menopause.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.120]   Now, there is a lot of controversy.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.240]   Again, I don't have a horse in the race.
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:06.440]   I would simply say, if you want to think about this,
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:09.640]   you have done a fantastic podcast on female health
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.200]   and female reproductive health.
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.000]   I know our friend, Petra Tia,
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.600]   has got a very clear stance
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.200]   on female hormone replacement therapy
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.440]   and the absence of fear one has to have
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.080]   around the risk of breast cancer.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.240]   And if you listen to him, he will excise,
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:30.200]   or at least he has disabused, I think,
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:33.160]   many people of the belief that that is a concern.
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:34.760]   But it's a very personal choice.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.000]   It's a woman's choice.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.880]   No one but a woman can decide.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.800]   But I would say that when women have gone
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.400]   into bio-identical hormone replacement therapy,
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.760]   one of the things that benefits is also sleep
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.680]   because it brings back under control
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:51.960]   some of these symptoms.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:55.920]   It reinstigates some of the renormalization
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.640]   of aspects of reproductive hormones.
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:02.120]   And those are things that can promote sleep,
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.520]   which when they become absent through menopause
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:06.760]   are causing sleep disruption.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.200]   - Great.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:10.280]   Someone asks, what does it mean
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.120]   if I can remember my dreams?
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:13.440]   Conversely, what does it mean
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.440]   if I cannot remember my dreams?
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:18.040]   Does this have any reflection on my sleep quality?
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:20.040]   Well, some of this was addressed during today's episode,
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:24.640]   but maybe just to give a short recap response,
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.680]   how would you respond to this?
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:30.280]   - So I would say that just because you remember your dreams
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.440]   or you don't remember your,
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:32.840]   let's say you don't remember your dreams,
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:34.280]   many people will ask me then,
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.680]   does that mean that I don't get REM sleep
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.200]   or I don't get enough REM sleep?
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.080]   No, absolutely it doesn't.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.600]   There seems to be no correlation
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.920]   between how much REM sleep that you're getting
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:46.760]   and whether or not you remember your dreams.
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:48.360]   That's, I think, point number one.
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:50.000]   Point number two is that there doesn't seem
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.040]   to be a strong correlation
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:53.120]   between you remembering your dreams
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:56.360]   and the quality of the waking day
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.640]   that ensues as a consequence
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:03.960]   of that dream-remembered sleep from the night before
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:06.640]   versus dream-non-remembered.
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.560]   The only time that we've got a little bit of data
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:10.200]   comes onto what we've spoken about today,
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:11.240]   which is lucidity,
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:14.800]   which is a different sort of one-up level of dreaming.
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:18.240]   There may be there's some unrestorative sleep argument,
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:20.720]   but for the most part, I would say, do not worry.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:22.600]   If you're not remembering your dreams,
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:25.240]   it doesn't mean that you are not dreaming.
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:26.640]   By the way, I've got a wacky theory.
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.680]   It doesn't mean that you are also not storing those dreams
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:32.520]   and being influenced by them.
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:34.840]   There is something called implicit memory,
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.840]   and it was long sort of held, you know,
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:39.440]   these versions of you go into a movie theater
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:41.880]   and for very brief milliseconds of periods of time,
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.960]   you're shown images of Pepsi cans or Coke cans.
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.280]   And then during the intermission,
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.760]   you track people's purchasing of soda,
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:51.000]   and sure enough, they will buy more Pepsi
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.440]   if they get flashed sort of.
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.000]   So we can actually embed implicit information into people,
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.600]   and it changes their behavior.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.000]   They have no recollection of the memory,
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.120]   but it's clearly there,
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:03.400]   and it's clearly influencing the behavior.
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:05.400]   What does this have to do with dreaming?
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.400]   I have a theory of dreaming where people,
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.720]   and I told you, most of us forget most of our dreams.
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:14.560]   And we think when we forget, those dreams have gone.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:16.600]   They've evaporated from our brain.
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:18.440]   What if it's not the case?
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:20.000]   Have you ever had that experience
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.760]   where you are waking up and you know you are dreaming
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:26.200]   and you just cannot capture it?
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:27.920]   And you think it's gone.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:29.360]   That's it, I've forgotten it.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:31.320]   And then two days later, you're in the shower,
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.600]   you're looking at the shampoo bottle,
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.400]   and the label all of a sudden just unlocks
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.760]   the memory of that dream, and it comes flooding back.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:40.880]   As a neuroscientist, that tells me an important thing.
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:43.800]   That memory is in existence,
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:45.840]   but previously it was unavailable.
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.960]   This is the difference between availability
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:49.720]   versus accessibility.
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.240]   The memory was available,
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.560]   but you'd lost the IP address to go and retrieve it.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.320]   Available, not accessible.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:01.240]   Now, if most of our dreams are still always,
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:04.280]   quote unquote, implicitly remembered,
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.440]   but we always fail to have accessibility,
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:11.040]   those memories arguably, according to my theory,
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:12.160]   are always available.
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.640]   They're always in our brains.
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.320]   We just don't have conscious accessibility to them.
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.000]   That doesn't change the fact that our dreams
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.480]   may shape a huge amount of our behavior implicitly.
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.400]   And to me, that's a wild, crazy theory.
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:30.560]   And someday when I retire, I'll do the study
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.720]   and try and disprove it, anyway.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:33.560]   - Love it.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:37.080]   What are the key supplements for sleep?
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.720]   And I just have to say, that's a huge topic.
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:41.280]   That's an entire episode into itself.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.040]   - Yeah, you and I should probably do
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:44.800]   intellectual jazz on that at some point.
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:45.720]   - Yeah, we should do that.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:50.720]   But let's constrain the question a bit for sake of time.
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.960]   What, if any, supplements do you personally take
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:00.680]   or recommend to people with the understanding
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:03.600]   that many people perhaps do not need supplements?
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:04.680]   We never want to give the impression
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:06.920]   that that's the first-line approach
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:09.080]   to dealing with sleep issues.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.120]   Get your sunlight, get your darkness,
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.560]   get your QQRT right.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:14.320]   All of that, if it's mysterious to you,
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.520]   all of that is in the previous episodes
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:18.800]   of this podcast series.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.640]   But assuming that someone wants to explore
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:25.360]   the supplement space, what do you recommend?
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:26.440]   What do you take?
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.080]   And please here, I'm going to encourage you
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:30.520]   to not take into consideration at all
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:33.160]   what I've ever said about supplements for sleep,
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:35.040]   'cause I think it's actually most useful
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.520]   if people get a tapestry of opinions.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:40.400]   Please, I'm just going to say that outright.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:41.240]   I don't, yeah.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.960]   - Say, maybe you could say a little bit more
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:46.680]   about those that you would recommend.
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.880]   And I think they're going to probably overlap
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:51.480]   'cause I already sort of know some of them, but.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:55.760]   - Sure, recommend, again, I just want to say
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:58.720]   that never take anything or remove anything
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:01.320]   from your regimen without talking to your doctor first,
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:03.880]   but, and always, always make sure
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:06.920]   that you're doing all the behaviors correctly first.
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:08.920]   But, and there's so many of them, you know,
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.000]   don't eat too close to bedtime.
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.600]   Get your morning sunlight, on and on, you know.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:16.400]   But the supplements that I recommend when people ask,
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:19.560]   and for supplement recommendation specifically,
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:21.240]   are magnesium threonate.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:22.080]   - Yep.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:25.040]   - It's more or less interchangeable
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.760]   with magnesium bisglycinate.
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:29.400]   It has a slight sedative property.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.160]   A lot of people are deficient in magnesium anyway.
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.800]   And this is magnesium taken
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:37.760]   about 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime.
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:39.120]   The other one is apigenin,
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:42.480]   which is essentially a derivative of chamomile.
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:43.600]   - Yep.
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:46.680]   - And then the third is theanine,
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:51.680]   which is known to have a mild anti-anxiety component to it.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.400]   The one caveat is that theanine can be problematic
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:58.040]   for people that have very vivid dreams.
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.280]   It can often, people say that it makes their dreams
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:01.480]   even more vivid.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:04.160]   And so if you suffer from that, or it's waking you up,
[02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:06.280]   then I suggest leaving out the theanine.
[02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:08.400]   I actually recommend people start with just one thing
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:12.160]   and then see how it affects them and then bring more in.
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.400]   I'll put a link in the show note captions
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:16.240]   to the dosages that were contained
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:19.080]   within a zero cost newsletter about sleep,
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.800]   rather than list off dosages here.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.880]   And then people can link to that in the show note captions.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:23.800]   Those are the main three.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:25.640]   And then there's one other which,
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.160]   and I use those by the way,
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:30.320]   most every night before sleep.
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.240]   And it has improved my sleep dramatically.
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:34.160]   The other thing that I sometimes use
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.920]   is 900 milligrams of inositol,
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:40.000]   which for whatever reason has, I find,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.320]   again, this is anecdata,
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.040]   makes it easier for me to fall back asleep
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.280]   when I wake up in the middle of the night,
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:47.120]   especially if I haven't eaten
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:50.200]   very many starchy carbohydrates in the days preceding.
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:52.320]   I try and eat some starches after hard training
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.480]   and things of that sort.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:57.160]   But sometimes if I'm on a lower carbohydrate regimen,
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.960]   then I find it extra difficult to sleep.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:03.800]   So I'll throw in some inositol.
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:04.840]   I will say there have been nights
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.480]   where I forget my supplements and just fall asleep.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:10.640]   And so it's tough to say exactly
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.920]   what each of those is doing and in what combinations.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:13.920]   You always need to think about
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.080]   how much disposable income somebody has.
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.640]   Again, get your behaviors right,
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:19.800]   get the do's and don'ts that Matt described
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:22.600]   during the course of this podcast series right,
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:24.920]   and then consider supplementation.
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:27.080]   But that's pretty much what I rely on.
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:28.840]   - Yeah, I like what you're saying,
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.040]   both the philosophy of it too,
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:31.600]   because the things that we've spoken about,
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:33.880]   the QQRT and all the different methods,
[02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:36.800]   they are a log order magnitude greater
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:39.360]   in terms of how they will course correct your sleep
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:42.040]   than probably any supplement effect that I know of.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:45.440]   But to go back to your MAG-T, MAG-3 and 8,
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.320]   I think there is some evidence,
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:48.440]   definitely interesting evidence.
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:50.280]   It was more so in older adults
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:52.360]   and they were able to show increases
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:54.280]   in the total amount of deep sleep.
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:58.400]   I think it was somewhere around about 15 to 20%,
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:00.960]   although that's the relative percent difference.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.200]   If you look, I think it was only about six
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:05.800]   or seven minutes of total deep sleep,
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:07.760]   but there is some evidence there.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.040]   The evidence by way of you've heard the story
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.200]   of that magnesium is good for sleep,
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:14.520]   it's principally derived from evidence
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.720]   of people who are magnesium deficient.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:18.920]   And when you make the magnesium normative,
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.320]   they start sleeping better.
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:22.400]   That's a very different question than saying,
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:25.480]   I am magnesium normative, I am in normal ranges.
[02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:29.320]   And then I add to it, do I expect any greater benefit?
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:32.400]   That's like me saying, you're at an oxygen saturation
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:36.400]   of 99.9 and I'm going to give you pure oxygen.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:38.680]   It's not gonna move you above a hundred,
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:39.760]   you're already at ceiling.
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:42.840]   Whereas if you are at 85% and I give you oxygen,
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:45.440]   you're going to get a lovely benefit from that.
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:49.240]   So, but I like MAG-3 and 8 because it is based
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:50.920]   on the evidence, the only one that does cross
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:52.800]   the blood brain barrier.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:55.480]   People have said, well, then why do I get a benefit
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.680]   from things like the other one that I would speak about
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:00.200]   is probably slow MAG, because it can be tough
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:03.920]   on some people's tummy and it's a coated form of magnesium.
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:06.880]   That doesn't necessarily cross the blood brain barrier,
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:10.440]   but magnesium, I would say if one to focus on
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.560]   would maybe be magnesium chloride.
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:16.600]   That seems, maybe Petra Teer has released a podcast
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:17.440]   on this too.
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.000]   That seems to be, I think, an effective one
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.440]   for bioavailability.
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.240]   But if it doesn't cross the brain barrier,
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:25.640]   how can it be affecting sleep?
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.440]   Because sleep is of the brain, by the brain,
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:28.520]   and for the brain.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.400]   One of the reasons is because of muscle relaxation.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.480]   So, if you're too tense in your body,
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:35.760]   it feeds signals of stress to your brain.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:37.600]   And if you're stressed, as we've spoken about,
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:38.840]   you're not going to sleep well.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:41.760]   So, I think there could be indirect effects
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.600]   of forms of magnesium that do not cross
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:45.920]   the blood brain barrier.
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:48.880]   Again, assuming that you are magnesium deficient.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:52.280]   I think epigenic chamomile has some good evidence.
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:55.480]   Valerian root, unfortunately, if you look at the data,
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:56.840]   it doesn't seem to hold up
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:59.760]   in terms of any sleep benefit whatsoever.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.920]   Probably two that I would add to that list.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:03.840]   The first is glycine.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.280]   And here we're talking about doses
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.840]   of maybe 1.5 to two grams of glycine.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:12.320]   Has quite a reliable, robust literature.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:14.240]   Now, it's not randomized control trials
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.120]   of a level of a drug, because these are supplements.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.680]   You don't get those studies,
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.960]   but it does seem to have quite a reliable benefit
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.240]   based on what I've seen in the literature.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:26.960]   The final one I would say, which has very good data
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.800]   to support its action,
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.200]   is something called phosphatidylserine,
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:34.600]   phosphatidylserine.
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.640]   And again, I've got no association
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.240]   with any supplement company whatsoever,
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:41.960]   but this has been reliably demonstrated
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:45.120]   to tamp down the cortisol response.
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.680]   Now, that data, you've got to be careful.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.880]   If you look at it and read the studies, which I have,
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.360]   it's principally in athletes
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:53.440]   and they use an athletic performance intervention
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.760]   to brute force cortisol to go up.
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:57.400]   And then they use this medication
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.600]   and it brings it back down, but it is reliable.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:02.440]   I bring this up because we spoke about
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:04.200]   in one of our episodes,
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:07.320]   insomnia patients, as they're trying to fall asleep,
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:09.200]   cortisol is coming down just like it is
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:10.360]   in all healthy people.
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:13.120]   And it drops low just as we're about to fall asleep.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:15.400]   But in insomnia patients, it spikes back up again.
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.040]   And then it does in the middle of the night.
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:19.440]   So here is a medication that one could try
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:22.760]   to try to tamp down that cortisol specifically
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:24.080]   as you're going into sleep.
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:25.640]   And that may be of help too.
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:27.720]   So those are the only two that I would give
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:32.400]   with the same caveat that get everything else straight,
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.520]   stop worrying about buying supplements
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:36.520]   and thinking it's going to be a quick fix,
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.320]   get the basics in place.
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:40.840]   And then we can think about fine tuning you
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:43.440]   for the final couple of percent optimization
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.640]   that you get from supplements.
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:46.800]   - Terrific answer.
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:51.640]   The final question of this sixth
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.520]   and final episode of this podcast series
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.280]   on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:58.120]   - I'm so sad.
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:58.960]   I don't want to leave.
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.240]   I don't want to stop speaking about sleep.
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:01.600]   - Well, we can always do another.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:02.440]   - I would love to.
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:03.920]   - If the literature changes, it evolves,
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:06.240]   we can do another.
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:09.440]   And another is the following.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.920]   If you could give just one tip for getting better sleep,
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:13.880]   what would that be?
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:16.320]   - Regularity.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.280]   Just keep things regular.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.600]   If you get regular sleep,
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.000]   a lot of things will start to take care of themselves.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.920]   And after that, if they don't,
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:29.000]   we'll have another conversation
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.080]   and we'll go back to the other three keys,
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:33.400]   the other three of the four macros of sleep,
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.040]   quantity, quality, and regularity,
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.480]   as I've spoken about in timing,
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:40.080]   and then all of the other protocols that we've mentioned.
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.800]   But start with regularity, get that straight.
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:47.160]   And I would also say your timing too,
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:51.400]   the R and the T of QQRT, figure out your chronotype,
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:54.600]   get good with your chronotype as best you can,
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:56.280]   and then get regular.
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:58.000]   If you do those two things,
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]   sleep in synchrony with your chronotype
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.400]   rather than against it,
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.160]   and you are being regular weekdays and weekends,
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:08.640]   you will get a long way to getting better sleep.
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:09.520]   - Fantastic.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:10.560]   Well, I'll put one in.
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:13.280]   If you could give just one tip for getting better sleep,
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.240]   what would it be?
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:16.720]   I suggest you listen to all six episodes
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.960]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast guest series
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.120]   with Dr. Matthew Walker about sleep
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:23.320]   and ways to improve sleep,
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:26.920]   because episode one covers the biology and the basics
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:30.160]   of how to get better sleep and what sleep is.
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:32.300]   Episode two gets into the more advanced tools,
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:34.680]   although I think they are tools that everyone,
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:38.200]   I know they are tools that everyone can and should consider.
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.640]   Episode three gets into the power of naps, caffeine, food,
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:44.240]   and the timing of those.
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:45.380]   Oh, so powerful.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:49.060]   Episode four gets into the role of sleep
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:51.480]   in learning, memory, and creativity.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:53.960]   What's more interesting than that?
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:56.560]   Episode five, we discussed sleep
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.480]   and its impact on emotional health and mental health.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:05.320]   And today we were discussing dreaming and lucid dreaming.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:08.420]   And here is where I get to say,
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:13.280]   Dr. Matthew Walker, thank you oh so much,
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:18.280]   oh so much for giving us a absolutely world-class grand tour
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:23.600]   of this incredible aspect of our lives that we call sleep.
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:29.240]   And in doing so, also making it extremely clear,
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:31.600]   extremely actionable at every step,
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:33.760]   and very, very thorough in a way
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:37.720]   that really honors the interest and intellect
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:42.720]   and just real sincere interest in this topic
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:44.580]   on the part of the audience.
[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:48.720]   So I could not think of a single better person
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:51.560]   for this series than you, alive or dead.
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:53.400]   Fortunately, you're alive.
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:57.480]   And I just want to say on behalf of myself,
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:00.040]   everyone else here at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:04.560]   and the many, many millions of people listening to
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:08.480]   or watching this series, thank you ever so much.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:12.120]   - For having me on, for giving me this opportunity,
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:13.800]   firstly, thank you.
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:18.800]   But also for the generosity of your heart, your intellect,
[02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:24.040]   and your willing to disseminate knowledge
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:27.080]   to millions of people, myself included.
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:31.720]   It is my privilege to sit next to you, across from you,
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:35.640]   and I've received so much wisdom and knowledge from you
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:37.400]   as so many others have.
[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:40.040]   You are an international treasure.
[02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.180]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:43.180]   - Well, thank you.
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:44.660]   I'll try and take that in.
[02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:49.300]   I'm grateful for you being a colleague and a friend.
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:54.300]   And my favorite sign-off with people I love is more soon.
[02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:56.380]   - Take care.
[02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:58.180]   - Thank you for joining me for today's episode

[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.540]   I do read all the comments.
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:40.540]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:42.020]   we discuss supplements.
[02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:44.160]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:46.180]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:47.580]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:49.540]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:50.700]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:52.340]   discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:54.900]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:57.740]   that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:00.000]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.740]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:06.220]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[02:32:06.220 --> 02:32:07.740]   And on all those platforms,
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:10.020]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.500]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:12.980]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:14.820]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.340]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:19.620]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:20.780]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.540]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:25.420]   our Neural Network Newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:28.260]   that provides podcast summaries as well as protocols
[02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:30.740]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:33.380]   that cover everything from neuroplasticity and learning
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.440]   to sleep, to deliberate cold exposure,
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:36.860]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:39.900]   We have a foundational fitness protocol and much more,
[02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:41.860]   all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:43.940]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:46.140]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:48.580]   and by supplying your email, you can subscribe.
[02:32:48.580 --> 02:32:50.760]   I want to point out that we do not share your email
[02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:51.700]   with anybody.
[02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:53.040]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:55.180]   for today's discussion all about sleep
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:56.780]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:32:56.780 --> 02:32:58.820]   And last but certainly not least,
[02:32:58.820 --> 02:33:00.780]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:03.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.940]   (upbeat music)
