[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   [music]
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.460]   That's the track "Fallen" off Trip Lee's album "The Good Life", three years old and still a personal
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.960]   favorite, an amazing album. And it's Friday and we're back one last time with
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.420]   hip-hop artist and author Trip Lee. Trip, you are a writer and so of course you're
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.040]   a reader as well, so I want to ask you, outside of the pages of Scripture of
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.400]   course, who are the most influential theologians or the most influential
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   books by theologians that have shaped your life and shaped your ministry?
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.860]   That's a really hard question for me because I love reading and really books
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120]   have been huge in my life. That's part of why I wanted to write, just like with
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780]   music. Music impacted me, I wanted to do music to impact people. The same thing
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.540]   with books, but a couple I think I could point out, "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.140]   That was a book that was recommended to me when I was about 15 or 16 years old
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.140]   and I was passionate about Jesus, but I hadn't read any really good books yet
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.660]   and I didn't know how to even find good books. I was just reading whatever and a
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.940]   guy who's a disciple of me at the time recommended that to me. And let me tell
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.180]   you, it changed my life because I had never read a book with such a big view
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.460]   of God. You know, I knew God was big and he was good, but when I read that book,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.380]   just the depth of doctrine and theology rooted in Scripture and all with kind of
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.780]   the context of a relational knowledge of God, it really changed my life. Another
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.460]   book that was really helpful for me, there have been so many Piper books that have
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.140]   been deeply helpful for me, probably my favorite is "When I Don't Desire God"
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.900]   because for me it came at a crucial time when I was really just trying to think,
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.180]   "In my day to day, how do I really fight for joy in God?" And you know, I want to
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.860]   desire God. I understand that's a part of God sanctifying me, but how do I do it?
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.700]   And that book was just so good and helpful for me and giving me a good kind
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.100]   of worldview for that. So that book was huge. Arnold Dalimore's biography of
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.620]   Spurgeon, just called Spurgeon, was huge for me because I love Spurgeon. I've read
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.700]   a lot of his stuff and have been really encouraged by it. And I love reading
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.140]   biographies because you just get to see God's providence in the life of a man,
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.900]   and especially extraordinary. It can be discouraging when you read about
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.580]   Spurgeon because you're like, "What in the world am I doing? He did so much."
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   Yes, painfully so.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.060]   And like, "How is he this amazing?" He was a pastor in '19 and the Lord was using him in
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.780]   incredible ways, and he read all these books and did all this stuff in the
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.540]   orphanage and past his college, all of that. But it's really cool to see God's
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.700]   providence in his life because as much as you want to look at him and say, "Man,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.820]   he's amazing," it's still really clear. The amazing one is God because he's
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.020]   orchestrated all these things. And that happens when you read so many
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.620]   biographies of Christian men and women over history. And I can name a trillion
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.420]   more books, but those are three that have really influenced me deeply.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.100]   Wonderful. And to repeat, those books are Knowing God by J.I. Packer, Spurgeon by
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.540]   Arnold Dalimore, and When I Don't Desire God by John Piper, which you can
