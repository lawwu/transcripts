[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:39.120]   Lac Mande, in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask that you please stand by and be prepared for the day of our Lord, this day of August, and of the independence of the United States of America, the 243rd, Donald J. Trump.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.100]   I always enjoy presidential proclamations. They're funny because it's such a formal language that we don't use much in day-to-day discourse.

[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:50.860]   I think that if I were to do a survey of researchers who advocate for a vegetarian diet, and I ask them, "Would you rather somebody eat vegetables and meat from time to time, or would you rather somebody eat vegetables and packs of processed foods, Oreos, Twinkies, I don't even know the names, Kellogg's cereal for breakfast?"
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:50.860]   I think that if I were to do a survey of researchers who advocate for a vegetarian diet, and I ask them, "Would you rather somebody eat vegetables and meat from time to time, or would you rather somebody eat vegetables and packs of processed foods, Oreos, Twinkies, I don't even know the names, Kellogg's cereal for breakfast?"

[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.540]   I think most of them would probably say, "Well, we'd rather somebody eat vegetables and some meat." And this seems to me, in some of the diets that I have read, to be one of the big challenges is figuring out what your control group is. If your control group is people who engage in the standard American diet and the standard American lifestyle, it seems like when measured against that control group, almost anybody who adopts almost any diet will have some improvement.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.580]   I've seen analyses in some books written where people talk about certain foods, getting rid of certain foods, adding on certain foods, adding in pasta, getting rid of meat, getting rid of pasta, adding in meat, adding more vegetables.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:38.580]   There are people who advocate for a diet that simply involves changing the amount of sleep that you get.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:50.220]   But what seems to be the case is that the control group usually seems to be the people who are involved in the standard American diet and the standard American lifestyle.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   And I personally think that almost any diet works,
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   I think most of them will probably say, "Well, I don't want to eat vegetables and packs of processed foods, Oreos, Twinkies, I don't even know the names, Kellogg's cereal for breakfast."
