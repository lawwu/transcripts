[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   My name is Joshua, and today we're going to kick off National Preparedness Month, September
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   2018.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.040]   Let me read to you a couple of paragraphs from the recent presidential proclamation
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.280]   on National Preparedness Month 2018.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.000]   It goes like this, issued on August 31, 2018.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.280]   National Preparedness Month is a time to focus our attention on the importance of preparing
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.040]   our families, homes, businesses, and communities for disasters that threaten our lives, property,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.800]   and homeland.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.160]   During this time, we also honor the brave men and women who selflessly respond to crises
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.680]   and disasters, rendering aid to those in need, blah blah blah.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.140]   And that is signed, of course, by President Donald J. Trump.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.040]   He has set his hand, or as the quote would go, "In witness whereof, I have hereunto set
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.340]   my hand this 31st day of August in the year of our Lord 2018, and of the independence
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.960]   of the United States of America, the 243rd Donald J. Trump."
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   Presidential proclamations are funny because it's such a formal language that we don't
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.100]   use much in day-to-day discourse.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.660]   But September is indeed the National Preparedness Month by virtue of presidential proclamation.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.400]   And I'm just going to use this as a rough outline for a various series of shows which
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.640]   I'll be sharing with you here in the month because I am convinced there is a deep connection
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.260]   between the term or the word preparedness and all of its associated concepts and financial
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.140]   planning.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.340]   Preparedness is basically the root of good financial planning.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.300]   Now in the traditional sense of financial planning, we usually think of financial products
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.780]   such as insurance policies and investment accounts.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.740]   And these products fundamentally are a component of preparedness.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.300]   What do you want to do to prepare for your death?
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.080]   Well, you prepare by making an estate plan, furnishing adequate wills and trusts.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.220]   You also put in place appropriate insurance policies which will remunerate your family
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.560]   or your business for the associated risks.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   And you do all of these things in advance.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.240]   You prepare.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.840]   What do you do to prepare for sickness?
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.100]   Well, you make sure that you have adequate savings to cover your personal expenses.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.880]   You put in place health insurance policies to pay for your medical bills, perhaps disability
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.660]   insurance policies to provide you with income in case of an extended disability.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.380]   This is all part of preparedness.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.880]   So preparedness is basically at the core of all good financial planning.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   But I think we often ignore some of the other extensions of the word preparedness.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.260]   And especially those of us who work in the financial planning industry are guilty of
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.080]   ignoring these things because we don't personally sell products to them.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.300]   I have learned that when you don't have products to sell, you tend to analyze the problem more
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.620]   comprehensively and to see the value of those products.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.700]   For example, I was often, when I was actively working as a financial planner, I was often
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.360]   consulted on some of the non-traditional components of financial planning.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.440]   But when I was working with client, excuse me, I was consulted frequently by other financial
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   advisors.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.820]   I remember when people would have a client who said, "I'm really worried about hyperinflation.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.240]   I think I'm going to buy gold coins."
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.140]   They would say, "Well, call Joshua and ask him or let's ask Joshua for his opinions."
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.860]   And I remember writing an email one time when a fellow advisor consulted and I said, "Here
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.420]   are the types of gold coins you should buy.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.540]   Here's what you should buy it for.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.660]   Here's when you should sell," and et cetera.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.940]   But what often happens is people pit these ideas against each other.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.620]   For example, frequently I read knowledgeable perceived experts who will make fun of some
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.900]   of the products that are advertised on right-wing talk radio.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.340]   Things like food insurance, which is basically the idea of buying significant amounts of
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.800]   food so that in case of an emergency you have food to pull, to fall back on.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.300]   Frequently these types of approaches are criticized as being foolish or scare, fear-mongering
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.260]   of some kind.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.620]   That's never made sense to me.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.340]   I think that's a really short-sighted and silly way to approach life because if you
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.660]   don't have food, it's hard to think about the value of anything else.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.500]   As I've previously discussed extensively, I'd a whole lot rather have food and no health
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.860]   insurance than have health insurance and no food.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.820]   One is a very significant need.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.900]   The other deals in the abstract.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.260]   If I have major medical bills, I declare bankruptcy.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.940]   The financial system protects me from the claims of those creditors and I go on to rebuild
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.940]   my life.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.300]   If I don't have food, I can't get up and go to work tomorrow.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.580]   If you've never lived at the bottom of society or if you've never tried to work with people
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.920]   at the bottom of society, what you find is those who don't have the resources to maintain
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.620]   their daily life, people who don't have food or a place to sleep, it's very hard.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.620]   They can't get ahead.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.940]   They can't even get a hand up.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.860]   I encourage you, spend some time talking with homeless people in your town or if you don't
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.100]   want to do that, spend some time online listening to people.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.700]   There's a great YouTube channel called Invisible People where the host of that channel or the
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.220]   hosts of that channel go and interview people with a video camera who are homeless.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.420]   And what you see again and again is they're stuck.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.660]   Well, why are they stuck?
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.220]   It's not because they're stupid.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.180]   Certainly they may be ignorant, but there may be many reasons and I'm not here to opine
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.660]   on homelessness.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.980]   But the point is when you're missing these basic things of life, the basic needs of life,
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.740]   it's very hard to be able to rebuild.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.260]   But if you have the basic needs of life, if you have a bed to sleep in, if you have a
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.780]   roof over your head, if you have food in your stomach, if your family is secure and you're
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.360]   not fearful that your things are going to be stolen, you're going to be physically attacked
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.380]   on a moment by moment, day to day basis, then you can afford the longer term thinking of
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.340]   building something more significant.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.340]   Most of us live at a level of affluence that provides us with the luxury of never even
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.600]   thinking about those things, those basic needs.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.920]   We should be grateful that we live in such affluence.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:18.500]   But for all of us, those basic needs can, in a moment, through a storm, through a medical
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:26.060]   emergency, those basic needs can all of a sudden become very, very important.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:35.780]   I had some experiences in my life that I never really guessed that I would have.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.820]   And I guess I knew intellectually that it could happen, but it wasn't until I could
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.860]   see them with my own eyes that I realized how important these things were.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.700]   And what you see is that if you're not prepared for the basic needs, the things that can't
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:57.420]   be solved necessarily with the financial system, no matter how vast your resources, you can
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.180]   quickly become desperate.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.740]   A couple of years ago, there was a hurricane headed for where I live in West Palm Beach,
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.740]   Florida.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:15.180]   So those of you who live in Hurricane Alley or hurricane regions know the drill.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.500]   Everyone waits to see what the hurricane's going to do.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.860]   And then when the hurricane starts heading your way, then people go out and they start
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.700]   buying water and flashlights and gasoline.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.900]   And all of a sudden, everything disappears.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.080]   And it's always amazing how you don't even have water.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.380]   But I remember I went to Costco and I decided to go out.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.240]   And part of it was to buy some stuff.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.300]   But part of it was to just to kind of see.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.740]   I've always had this interest in disasters.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.660]   I've always enjoyed being one of the volunteer responders and being involved in them.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.020]   I'm a sucker for information flows.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.340]   My wife would make fun of me when there's a disaster.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.420]   The most recent one that I remember doing this was the Houston floods.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.380]   And I was just entranced by the Houston floods.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.060]   I had four screens going with all these different web feeds of different video feeds from the
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.660]   local TV cameras.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.780]   And I've really been interested in that topic for whatever reason.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:14.540]   So I went out to Costco to pick up some additional supplies for my own family.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.680]   And also just because I like to be out in that.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.260]   It's kind of a different season.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.860]   And in this case, Costco had been closed over the weekend due to a holiday.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.860]   And it was a Monday morning and the storm was expected on something like Thursday.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.020]   And I went there.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.100]   I was there about 20 minutes early and the line was hundreds of people deep.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.300]   And this panic set in where all of a sudden everyone felt like, well, there's more people
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.260]   and the store is not open yet.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.220]   And there's people pulling in, in expensive cars and then just running across the parking
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.420]   lot to get in line.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.540]   I don't know what Costco is like where you live, but where I live, I don't see a lot
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.780]   of poor people in Costco.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.700]   The Costco where I live is very filled with a lot of affluent people.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.540]   You get all these elderly retirees that have loads of money and they go into Costco and
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.740]   buy three or four things.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.180]   And it's just very, it's very obvious from the cars that people drive that the clothes
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:15.300]   they wear and the age of the face is present, that it's a very affluent community that shops
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.660]   at my local Costco.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.980]   And I looked around and I, nobody, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.980]   Nobody was ready to pick a fight.
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.980]   But you could just feel this tension in the air, this tension among people that if things
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:37.940]   were a little bit worse, they would have been ready to fight over cases of bottled water.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.980]   And I realized how close we live to the edge in society.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.780]   Now there are a number of other experiences that I've heard, but they're immaterial for
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   the moment.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.260]   Excuse me, other experiences I've had.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.020]   But by watching some of these things and some of the things on TV where you see, you realize
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.980]   that all of a sudden things can happen.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.980]   And this is really important.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:06.780]   It's a really important part of financial planning to be prepared for things that can't
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:13.960]   perfectly be covered by the insurance policies that we all have and should have.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:21.140]   And that's one of the changes that I've experienced since I left the world of product sales.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.220]   I realized that in order to do good financial planning, we always need to take a more holistic
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.220]   approach.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.820]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.640]   Money and insurance is a component of good planning.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.300]   Money should always be your first thing that you go for.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.380]   Stacking up money, which is why I seek to emphasize it to you again and again and again,
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.540]   pile up money.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.620]   Money is the most marketable commodity in the world.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.060]   And if you have money, you can solve most problems.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:55.700]   If we dump you out of an airplane in the middle of a war zone and your skin is a completely
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.020]   different color than everyone that's fighting and they're all hunting for you, if you have
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.620]   enough money, though you don't have food, you don't have water, you don't have contacts,
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.900]   if you have enough money, you can probably buy your way out of the problem.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.180]   So money is always your first step.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.420]   But often money is a very expensive step.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.300]   And if you'll spend a little bit of money now, you can avoid spending a lot of money
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   later.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.540]   So I'm going to riff on this preparedness theme during the month of September with a
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:33.380]   number of different shows on a diverse range of topics, because I really think that by
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.780]   my sharing with you some ideas, I can stimulate your thinking to look at your own situation
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:44.780]   and to apply good financial planning to the topics that you're not usually thinking about.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:56.020]   If we do that, you'll build a more robust and resilient life and have a whole lot more
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:02.820]   money available for your longer term financial goals.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.620]   Just consider the logic of a few examples.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.860]   I think you should have disability insurance.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.620]   But doesn't it make a lot of sense for you to think carefully about what you eat and
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:21.340]   how you move and the toxins that are in your environment so that you can avoid the need
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.340]   to draw on the insurance policy?
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.100]   Or doesn't it make sense for you to wear your seatbelt and drive a safe car at a safe
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:35.220]   rate of speed so that you lower your risk of being involved in an automobile accident?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.220]   Or with your home insurance?
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.940]   Yes, your home insurance will compensate you if your house burns down, but doesn't it
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.500]   make sense to make sure that your house has wiring that's up to code and has properly
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.620]   functioning smoke detectors and fire extinguishers that can come to hand easily, rather than
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.100]   going through all the hassle of having your house burn down and dealing with an insurance
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   policy?
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:05.660]   A $5 fire extinguisher that is in the cabinet beside your stove might put out the fire before
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.700]   it burns the house down.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.220]   But if you don't buy the $5 fire extinguisher and you just buy the homeowner's insurance
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.660]   policy, you've done incomplete planning.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.820]   Now the inverse is also true.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.300]   If you have a bunch of fire extinguishers, but you don't have a homeowner's insurance
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.300]   policy, then you've also done incomplete planning.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:32.020]   Because although you may be very careful, a fire may sweep in from your neighbor's house
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.060]   and light yours on fire, or it may sweep up the valley through the trees and light your
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.460]   entire development on fire.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:46.420]   The volcano underneath your community might ooze lava out that bursts your home on fire.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.500]   So both of these are important.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.440]   But I hear a lot of people focusing on homeowner's insurance and not a lot of people talking
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.660]   about fire extinguishers.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.220]   My hope is to bring these together for you.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:07.220]   There's a much more efficient planning process if you start with root causes.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.860]   And by the way, all of this applies to accumulation goals as well.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.900]   I've repeatedly emphasized in my work that before you try to save millions of dollars
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.240]   for retirement, you should build a life and a work that you don't want to retire from.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.580]   Because you may or may not successfully save millions of dollars for retirement, but you're
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.560]   going to be working to get there.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.860]   So why not embrace that work along the way and build a life that you don't want to retire
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:43.100]   from while you're on your way to building enough reserves and investments that you could
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.740]   retire any day you want.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.740]   Doesn't that make more sense to you?
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:55.300]   Or with college savings, this is probably one of my personal pet peeves, but I've done
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.580]   so much college planning over the years, but college planning is a really short-sighted
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.700]   thing to do if your definition of college planning is simply, "How can I save money
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:10.820]   in some kind of tax-advantaged fund so that my children can go to college?"
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.780]   There are far too many of us who are parents who just haphazardly throw money at the problem
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.380]   thinking that's going to make our children's lives better.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.500]   Well, I'm here to advocate for a little bit more of a thoughtful approach and say, "No,
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.140]   that doesn't necessarily make your children's lives better."
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.940]   First, college may not be right for them.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:34.060]   Frequently, college is not a good solution or a good option for many students.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:40.260]   Now you've heard all these arguments, but there's a high percentage of degrees that
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:46.220]   many of my compatriots in my peer group have found are entirely financially worthless.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.380]   They don't result in any skills that are valuable in the labor market.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.460]   I have so many friends who are embittered about their college decision because they
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:17:03.380]   came out the other side with a diploma and no job prospects.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.080]   College may be a very damaging thing to your son or daughter.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.940]   It certainly has been damaging to many of my friends.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.860]   College can lead you into a lifestyle that is so morally debauched that it leads to a
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.320]   lifetime of personal injury.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.300]   One of my major concerns is excessive drunkenness on college campuses.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.140]   You may save all the money in the world so that you can send your son and daughter into
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.940]   this environment.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:38.300]   And the excessive drunkenness leads to, of course at the most extreme, death or disability
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.780]   in some way due to alcohol poisoning.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.600]   But more frequently, it just leads to a whole series of life decisions that impact people
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.620]   for years.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:54.180]   DUI infractions, killing people while they're drunk behind the wheel, high rates of sexual
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.820]   activity and sexual promiscuity, sexual assault.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.200]   So frequently, that decision to encourage your son or daughter to go into a morally
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.820]   debauched environment filled with excessive drunkenness leads to your son or daughter
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:12.180]   being sexually assaulted, which leads to lifelong problems.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.380]   And if you've ever been involved with marriage counseling or talking with somebody who's
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.880]   been sexually assaulted, that has the impact of generations.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.580]   Somebody who has never healed from a sexual assault that they experienced during their
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:31.520]   college years, and all of a sudden they're married 15 years and yet they are still experiencing
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.380]   major emotional, psychological problems from that.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:43.980]   And yet it may have been avoided by a more careful decision related to college.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.860]   Back to the financial aspects, let's say that college is a good decision and you can account
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:56.660]   for the social pressure, you can account for the morally debauched environment, you can
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:05.140]   account for the theory that's being taught and all of the worldview that's going to be
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.540]   foisted upon your child.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.460]   Well, now back to the finances.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.460]   There's no reason in the world why a young person should need outside funding for college
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.380]   in today's world.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:21.900]   There is so much money available for college for students who have high academic results.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.500]   There's so much money available for college for students that demonstrate character proficiency.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.620]   There's so much money available for college that no student who is academically qualified
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:39.220]   for college should ever need to borrow money or ever need to be provided for by parents.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:45.640]   But yet it's those decisions years before that result in a high school student demonstrating
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.300]   academic competence or an elementary school student developing the character qualities
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.980]   that will lead them to the ability to perform well in high school and to perform well in
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.100]   college.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.500]   So shouldn't we spend 80% of our time talking about those things that prepare a young man
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.700]   or woman for college and perhaps 20% of our time talking about thinking, figuring out
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.460]   which particular type of college savings account we're going to use or not use?
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:23.460]   But the financial planning industry, because we in the industry are very effective at selling
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.220]   those solutions and not so good at sitting down and having a difficult conversation with
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:33.180]   you about the academic readiness of your child or their personal character.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.180]   We just sell the solution that we can make money on.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.580]   We sell the 529 account because we can do it easily and it makes us a little bit of
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.900]   money and increases the amount of money we earn in investment fees.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.420]   I don't for a moment think that the average financial planner is competent to discuss
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:58.340]   with you or me what we're doing to prepare our five-year-olds to have the necessary character
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:04.980]   they'll need to stand strong and focus on their academic studies when they're 22 and
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.180]   not go and indulge themselves in excessive drunkenness.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:16.980]   It would be a little bit weird for that to be a component of the CFP curriculum.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.820]   But I do think that you and me as parents should be spending about 80% of our time thinking
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:30.660]   about that and 20% of our time talking with the CFP practitioner about which particular
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.580]   state's 529 plan would be appropriate for us.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:42.460]   See, the financial system can work really, really well in many circumstances.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.380]   But you have little control over the financial system.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.620]   You have a lot of control over those other things.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:56.060]   And if you'll focus on these other things, whether it's seeking to instill a strong character
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.380]   and moral fabric in your child's life, or whether it's making sure that your kitchen
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.880]   has fire extinguishers, these things are much more tangible than trying to understand the
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.340]   day-to-day vagaries of the stock market.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.700]   I don't know if the stock market will continue its record-setting success or not.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.640]   How do I know?
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.580]   But I do know that a fire extinguisher in your kitchen is a very cheap piece of insurance
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.980]   to buy to make sure that you can put out that grease fire.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.740]   Of course, I would be remiss in not pointing out that a fire blanket or a large pot that
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.880]   you know where it is mixed with a small fire extinguisher would probably be a better solution
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   for the grease fire.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.060]   Or what is it, salt that you can put on it and will also put the fire out?
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:49.980]   Anyway, a fire blanket and a small extinguisher has always been, in my mind, the simplest
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980]   thing.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.380]   You have a huge degree of control over these things, and safety and prevention are a huge
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.620]   deal.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.500]   We are fortunate to live in a very orderly world that's governed by the laws of cause
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.340]   and effect.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:10.140]   And if you'll think in advance and prepare for the circumstances down the road, then
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.440]   I think you'll get better results.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.620]   When I was younger, I spent a lot of time mowing lawns and I didn't wear ear protection.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.820]   I think I still have pretty decent hearing, but I'm sure that impacted me.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.840]   But I'm going to make sure that my 8-year-old, when he's out mowing the lawn, is wearing
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.940]   proper hearing protection.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:36.120]   Because a set of earmuffs can cost $5, but a set of hearing aids at 50 years old will
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.380]   cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.080]   Some of these things seem to be relatively inevitable as you age.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.860]   It seems to be inevitable that you'll lose some of your acuity of hearing and you'll
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.080]   wind up purchasing some form of hearing aid.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.360]   But you can forestall that to a much later age if you think ahead now and don't listen
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.500]   to music at very high volume in your earbuds and you make sure that you're always wearing
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.900]   appropriate hearing protection.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   Health is a big deal.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.860]   In a moment, I'm going to go through a number of the health-related factors that lead to
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.240]   early death and are some of the top leading causes of death.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.000]   But you can either spend more money on higher quality food, it seems to me, or you can spend
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.140]   more money on medications.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:35.980]   Well, I'm happy that we've got high quality efficacious medications, but I'd a whole lot
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:43.360]   rather feel better and not need the medicine and spend a little bit more money on food.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.460]   So I hope you'll consider some of these ideas and that they will stimulate you.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:52.720]   Some of them are very important in terms of their likelihood, their statistical likelihood.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.380]   Some of them are just going to be just a little bit fun because I think they're interesting
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.380]   topics.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.340]   But I'm going to start today by discussing some of the leading causes of early death.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:09.500]   And it's important that we always keep a firm grasp on the actual data, the actual likelihood
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.720]   of certain things happening.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.780]   We need to maintain a sense of perspective and be firmly grounded in reality.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:23.740]   Although we may have a vigorous national debate on the subject of gun violence, and we should
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:32.900]   have that debate, you are many, many, many times more likely to die from slipping and
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   falling in your home.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:42.820]   So you would probably be better served to leave your 12-gauge shotgun loaded, cocked
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.220]   and locked, ready to go, and leaning in the corner of the room and make sure that you
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.980]   pick up your throw rugs and make sure that your house has good handrails in the shower
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.960]   so you don't slip and fall and kill yourself in the shower.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.100]   And make sure that you don't slip and fall on the step outside.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.680]   Statistically, there's a very low chance of your experiencing even an accidental discharge
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.740]   of a firearm than of your falling.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:15.500]   Falling is one of the leading causes of early death, as we'll go through not today.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.860]   It's the number one cause, the number one category of preventable injuries in the United
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.100]   States.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.960]   So the obvious, you should immediately recognize the logical fallacy in what I've just said.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   It's not either/or.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.180]   I don't think you should leave your loaded 12-gauge cocked and locked in the corner of
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.740]   the dining room.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:42.060]   I think that should be properly secured and set aside.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:51.220]   But the risk to you is much higher of falling than is the risk of being injured by a firearm,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.460]   whether during an actual assault or not.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.940]   So let's today just talk through some of the leading causes of death.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:09.980]   Because of course, it's hard to imagine a circumstance that is more difficult financially
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.340]   to plan for and also just from the reality of life than death.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.060]   Here is the data on the leading causes of death in the United States.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:27.680]   And today's data is all coming from the Injury Facts Report, which is published by the National
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.780]   Safety Council, which is a government-run organization where they take the data and
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.780]   collate it.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.460]   So I'm reading here to you all leading causes of death in the United States for the year
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.760]   2016.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:52.380]   And the total number of the total cases of death in this particular data set is $2,744,000.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:59.180]   The number one leading cause of death is heart disease by a strong, strong margin.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:04.500]   635,000 of those 2.7 million deaths are due to heart disease.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:10.160]   And number two, following closely behind with almost 600,000 deaths is cancer.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:16.840]   Cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of death by a wide, wide margin.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:24.120]   Now the number three category is preventable injury, which is where we can spend a significant
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.600]   amount of time.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.680]   But I want you to recognize clearly that the medical risks are much more significant than
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.800]   the physical risks.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   Number one is heart disease.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.480]   Number two is cancer by a wide margin.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.080]   And number three, following along with only 161,000 deaths is preventable injury.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.260]   Number four is chronic lower respiratory diseases.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.660]   Five is stroke.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.900]   Six is Alzheimer's disease.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.660]   Seven is diabetes.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.000]   Eight is influenza and pneumonia.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.560]   Nine is nephritis.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.360]   And ten is suicide.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.540]   Now maybe you are much more competent with medical terms than I am.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.140]   I didn't know what nephritis was.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.800]   According to Wikipedia, nephritis is inflammation of the kidneys and may involve the glomeruli,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.240]   tubules or interstitial tissues surrounding the glomeruli and tubules and their various
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   medical conditions.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.880]   So I'm just going to call it kidney problems because I'm not entirely clear on what nephritis
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   is.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.320]   But it's a big deal, obviously, because it shows up with a significant factor in the
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.000]   data set.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.820]   Now the point I'd like to draw your attention to and my own is of these top ten leading
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:42.340]   causes of death, either eight or nine of them, depending on how you personally characterize
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.260]   suicide are medical conditions.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.600]   Only one of them, preventable injury, has anything to do with physical situations that
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.680]   you'll be in.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.480]   Heart disease and cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes,
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.280]   diabetes mellitus, if that particular modification of the word diabetes makes a difference, I
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   don't know, influenza and pneumonia, nephritis, and then suicide is number ten.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.220]   And depending on how you desire to treat the topic of suicide, that will determine whether
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.520]   you include that and how you include that in your personal planning.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:28.120]   So the point here is figuring out a plan for physical health, for strong physical health
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:37.200]   and the avoidance of disease, this should be very high on my and your, on our priorities.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   And it should be very high on the amount of time that we spend thinking about these topics,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.760]   studying them, and trying to figure out how to maintain long, healthy, disease-free lives.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.240]   How to avoid these particular medical conditions that we may suffer from.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.040]   And my caveat here, as I give you a few things to consider, is I would not consider myself
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.120]   a medical expert.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.640]   The problem with medical experts, in my analysis, after listening to a lot of them and reading
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:15.800]   a lot of them, is you can't seem to find any that really agree, and it's very hard for
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.040]   those of us who are non-medical experts to figure out who's telling the truth and who's
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.520]   not.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.920]   So I'm going to proceed forward with giving you just a few ideas that make sense to me,
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.880]   because I think we have swallowed a lie, which is to always revert to experts and the idea
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.800]   of expertise instead of using a little bit of common sense.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.120]   I find this particular topic of health and figuring out how to maintain health to be
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.680]   very personally frustrating, because no matter how much research I do, no matter how much
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.080]   reading I do, no matter how much listening I do, it seems like there's always one more
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.760]   person who disagrees with the person I just heard and has more compelling data.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.520]   And perhaps those who are more competent and have more experience can identify the problems
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.040]   in one person's argument and another person's data sets, but I struggle to do that.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.740]   I struggle to figure out who's right.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:16.200]   So I've taken a fairly simple approach to this, and I hope it helps you.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:23.760]   Without advocating for any one particular approach or one viewpoint, here are the three
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.800]   things that make sense to me that we should focus a lot of our time and attention.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.200]   If we're going to engage in a fight against these particular diseases and these particular
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.240]   health conditions, which have a very strong probability of ending our lives early, I think
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   there are probably three core ones and perhaps some more connected ones as well.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:54.520]   Number one, quality nutrition and adequate hydration.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.520]   Quality nutrition and adequate hydration.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.320]   Number two, maintaining and living in low toxicity environments.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:08.440]   Number three, assuring that we get adequate physical movement throughout all of our lives
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.400]   seems to be extremely important.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.240]   Now, I think there might be some other factors.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.960]   For example, I'm sensitive to an argument that somebody like a chiropractor would make
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:26.560]   towards the value of making sure that your skeletal alignment is optimum, but I think
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   these three are good enough for us to focus on.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.720]   Number one, quality nutrition and adequate hydration.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.260]   Here's my layman's understanding of this topic.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:44.480]   Your body is made up of the physical substances that you put into it.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.840]   There's nothing else that your body can work with to generate new cells, generate new tissues,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.080]   and heal itself than the physical substances that you ingest.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.240]   Now, those physical substances, of course, come through your mouth, the food that you
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   eat and the water that you drink.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:10.480]   So making sure that the quality of those substances is very high seems to me to be a very important
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   topic.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.540]   Now, that term quality is very subjective and open to interpretation.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:23.720]   Different people have different ideas about what quality food really is, and there are
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.840]   some very strongly held opinions and beliefs about this.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.560]   Now, I don't know who's right, but I'll tell you what I think seems to be a bit of consensus
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.620]   on the topic.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:41.820]   People frequently argue and debate about whether you should eat a diet that is high in fat
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:48.360]   and low in carbohydrates, high in carbohydrates, low in meat, low in fat, high in carbohydrates.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.500]   There's all these various debates.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.800]   But I don't think there's anybody that I've ever read that advocates for eating a lot
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.920]   of processed, packaged foods.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.320]   So one of the first movements towards making sure that there is quality nutrition going
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:11.040]   into your body seems to be making sure that we approach the topic of food and very clearly
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:18.240]   understand that highly processed, highly packaged foods are probably not going to be a cornerstone
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.680]   of good nutrition.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:30.560]   I think that if I were to do a survey of researchers who advocate for a vegetarian diet and I ask
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:38.720]   them, "Would you rather somebody eat vegetables and meat from time to time, or would you rather
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   somebody eat vegetables and packs of processed foods, Oreos, Twinkies, I don't even know
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.680]   the names, Kellogg's cereal for breakfast, which would you rather somebody eat?"
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.640]   I think most of them would probably say, "Well, we'd rather somebody eat vegetables and some
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.880]   meat."
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.680]   And this seems to me in some of the diets that I have read to be one of the big challenges
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.280]   is figuring out what your control group is.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.040]   If your control group is people who engage in the standard American diet and the standard
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:14.200]   American lifestyle, it seems like when measured against that control group, almost anybody
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.720]   who adopts almost any diet will have some improvement.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:26.240]   I've seen analyses in some books written where people talk about certain foods, getting rid
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.600]   of certain foods, adding on certain foods, adding in pasta, getting rid of meat, getting
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   rid of pasta, adding in meat, adding more vegetables.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.660]   There are people who advocate for a diet that simply involves changing the amount of sleep
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.220]   that you get.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:43.000]   But what seems to be the case is by the control group usually seems to be the people who are
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.760]   involved in the standard American diet and standard American lifestyle.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:55.240]   And I personally think that almost any diet works to some extent because it forces people
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.760]   to pay attention to what they're eating.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.360]   And if you just look at your food and it kind of seems really bright orange or it seems
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.480]   dead or it came out of a package or it's the kind of thing that you realize that usually
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.120]   fat people eat this stuff and you start paying attention to what you eat, that seems to be
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.920]   sufficient to cause some significant changes in many people.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.520]   So I think most people would agree on avoiding the standard American diet and especially
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.360]   on avoiding processed foods, junk foods, etc.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.280]   Now, the good news here is financially those are your most expensive foods because they
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.440]   are value added foods to use the nomenclature of the food industry.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.600]   See, if you take wheat and you sell wheat berries, you have to sell it pretty cheap
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.880]   because that's pretty close to what the farmer is selling.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:48.040]   And if the farmer is selling wheat for $20 a bushel and the person who's reselling the
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.720]   wheat into your grocery store is reselling it for $30 a bushel, that farmer is going
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.320]   to figure out a way to sell it directly to you for $25 a bushel.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.880]   So there's not much of an ability for the food maker to mark up that particular bushel
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.560]   of wheat that they're trying to sell you.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.480]   But if you take wheat and you start to process it, now it starts to go beyond the farmer's
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   ability.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.240]   The farmer sells the wheat and the wheat gets turned into flour.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.640]   Well now the price can go up pretty significantly because the farmer doesn't have an operation
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:23.280]   to create flour, the farmer has an operation to produce wheat.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   So the price of flour is higher than the price of wheat.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:32.560]   Well, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on what kind of flour you buy, you've probably
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.360]   degraded the nutritional value of the wheat.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.640]   I'd a whole lot rather eat some bread that was made from flour that was freshly ground
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.920]   and was whole wheat than bread that was made from a highly refined processed flour that
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.720]   had some of the nutrients stripped out.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.760]   And I think most people would seem to agree.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.800]   We may have a good debate about gluten and wheat and et cetera, but I think there's just
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.200]   something where most of us would look at a loaf of freshly baked whole wheat bread and
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.680]   recognize, "Hey, that's probably going to have more nutritional value for us than a
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.080]   loaf of bread that is made out of a bunch of bleached enriched wheat.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.920]   And it's probably also going to have fewer toxins."
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.040]   Now back to the value add and then I'll come back to the making of bread.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.280]   If that particular reseller can then take flour and turn it into bread and sell you
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.920]   bread, they can charge you a whole lot more money for the bread than they could charge
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.400]   you for the raw flour.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.240]   And things would continue of course, because a lot of people can make bread.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.320]   But if they can take that wheat and they can add some corn syrup and some hydrogenated
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.640]   blah, blah, blah, the names I don't know, then all of a sudden they can turn that wheat
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.780]   flour that they turned and turn it into Oreo cookies.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.200]   Now the price per unit is very, very high and you're going to pay a lot of money for
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.280]   the Oreo cookies and the farmer can't make Oreo cookies.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.040]   The farmer just makes the wheat.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.800]   So it seems to me that one of the most intelligent things to do for your health and also for
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   your pocketbook is to work back in the food chain towards those more basic, simple, elemental
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   factors.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:18.240]   And I think this is doable on many different levels.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.520]   If you have a choice between buying whole wheat bread in the grocery store and buying,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:29.240]   I hate to pick on Oreos, but crackers or something like that, you're going to get a lot more
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.960]   value for your dollar buying a loaf of bread than a box of crackers.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.520]   And you're going to get a lot more nutritional value from buying a loaf of bread than a box
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.720]   of Oreos.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.700]   Now you may consider working back another time.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.000]   You may get more value for your dollar by purchasing the flour from the grocery store
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.800]   and making your own bread.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.440]   Doesn't cost very much, will save you a good amount of money, and I think it'll be healthier.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.040]   Because to make the bread that they put on the grocery store shelves, if you read the
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.600]   ingredients, then all of a sudden you have to finally have preservatives and stabilizers
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.940]   and color stabilizers, et cetera, to make that bread sit there, even though it's only
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.820]   sitting there for a few days.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:15.600]   But if you buy the flour and the yeast and the oil and the water and honey and you make
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.480]   the bread yourself, even if you're buying flour, then you can go ahead and make sure
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.760]   that some of those preservatives have been pulled from the mix.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.680]   And I think you're getting fewer toxins, which you get to a low toxicity environment in a
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.560]   moment, and you'd think you'd get a little bit more nutrition.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   I can't prove that.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   I don't have all the data.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.480]   This just seems to be my common sense approach.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.920]   You judge it for yourself.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.320]   And then finally, of course, if you want to have the lowest cost financially, and I think
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:49.120]   probably the highest nutritional benefit of the highest quality nutrition, then buy a
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.720]   bucket of wheat and a wheat grinder, grind the wheat and make the bread.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.440]   Now I think it's worth our trying to figure out if our wheat bellies are large because
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.760]   we're eating wheat or not.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   I don't know.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.080]   I'm not competent to know that.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   I don't know about gluten.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.400]   I read people who make the arguments about gluten.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.040]   I know if you're intolerant, you should need it, of course.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.480]   But of course, some people say that everyone's intolerant.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.120]   I don't know how to judge that.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:20.160]   But I think you get better results if you go closer to the elements and simpler, and
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.680]   you also save a lot of money.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.600]   When I was younger, that was one of the things my mom did.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   My family didn't have a lot of money.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.240]   We had a lot of kids and a basic income.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.240]   And growing up, I always remember her making bread and she would buy buckets of wheat.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   She had a wheat grinder.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.720]   She would grind the wheat and make the bread.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.120]   And it was, well, delicious and nutritious.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.960]   Now, take that and apply it to other things.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.480]   You can apply this to almost any kind of food group.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:58.400]   I think if you were to ask most low-carbers, most paleoprimal people, I guess low-carbers
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   would be better.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.000]   Let's say if somebody is pursuing a low glycemic index diet and you were asking a nutrition
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.280]   consultant, I think generally if you said, "Would you rather I eat baked potatoes,"
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.980]   which of course have a very high glycemic index or very high on the glycemic index and
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.320]   stimulate a lot of insulin production in your body, "Would you rather I eat a lot of baked
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.720]   potatoes or would you rather I eat a lot of potato chips?"
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.560]   Think they're going to say, "You should probably go for the baked potatoes."
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.880]   Just seems a lot better.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.280]   Potatoes have a lot of nutritional quality and they may mess up your blood sugar, but
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.400]   depending on your approach on that, it's just all around it's going to be better than the
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.980]   potato chips.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:45.360]   The good news is eating the potatoes instead of the potato chips is really good also for
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   your budget.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.760]   Now, I think it's really good for your food budget now and I also think it's really good
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.640]   for your medication budget later.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.240]   Think if you eat a lot more potato chips now, you're going to spend a lot more money on
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.080]   medications later.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.900]   But if you eat more baked potatoes now, I think you're going to spend less money on
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.920]   medications later.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Now from here, you're on your own.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:19.320]   This is my best guess at the principle, but the principle is look for quality nutrition
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.240]   and minimal processing.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.840]   Now the next category is low toxicity environments and here I want to talk about another group
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   of food.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.420]   I think that when you're analyzing your foods and you're trying to figure out what do I
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:42.240]   eat, although I appreciate the debates among people about should I eat meat or should I
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.320]   eat grain or what?
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.320]   Here's what I think.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.920]   First, everyone agrees you should eat vegetables.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.720]   I've never read somebody that doesn't think you should eat vegetables, but I think you
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.240]   got to look and say, "What's in those vegetables?"
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:02.600]   Now it makes all the sense in the world to me to recognize that a biodiverse environment,
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:10.480]   growing environment, has a stronger chance of leading to a biodiverse vegetable product.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.960]   I just don't see how, since the vegetable is also a component of its growing environment,
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:24.920]   just like our bodies are created by the food that we intake, I just don't see how a vegetable
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:32.520]   or a fruit that's grown in an environment that doesn't have a lot of biodiversity is
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:38.860]   going to have as much nutritional value for your body and mine as a vegetable that's grown
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.840]   in a high biodiversity environment.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:49.260]   So let me touch briefly for a moment on the organic question or my best guess at it.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:57.880]   It doesn't make sense to me to shop primarily for organic if organic doesn't mean biodynamically
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.680]   alive.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:06.280]   Just because something is grown without pesticides and fertilizers, I think that might be fine,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   and I might prefer to have fewer pesticides and fertilizers, but I'd probably rather eat
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:20.200]   some carrots that are grown in a rich black earth that you know, you can just see.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.760]   You can see the earthworms wriggling in it.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.040]   You can pick it up and you can smell it, smell all the smells, and you know, "Hey, this soil
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   is alive."
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.760]   I'd rather eat a carrot that came from that soil that also had been sprayed with insecticide
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:39.920]   than a carrot that came out of a biodynamically dead field where the insects were killed,
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   well, herbicide.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.720]   So there was herbicide on the carrot versus a biodynamically dead field where the carrots
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.960]   were weeded by flamethrowers.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.200]   Just seems to make sense to me.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.600]   Now, if we can avoid the insecticide or the pesticide, that sounds great to me, you know,
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.760]   to avoid it.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.240]   But I think a lot of our focus on the organic is just misplaced, and our actual question
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.760]   should be biodynamic.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.200]   How much nutrition does this vegetable have?
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.720]   Now, some of that can probably be measured by how it looks.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.880]   Is it rich?
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.200]   Is it vibrant?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.880]   Some of it I think is only going to be measured by trying to figure out how do you go to the
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.280]   farm where it's grown so that you can see the soil?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.120]   Because when my vegetables are grown in Chile and flown in on an airplane, I can't go there.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.080]   But I can go to the farmer's market around the corner, or I can go to the local farmer
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.320]   and I can look at their farm and I can see how are they doing and what's the soil look
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.320]   like?
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.360]   In my mind, that should be the question.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.680]   Now, back to toxins, and let's talk on another one.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:44.520]   I think a big focus should also be on a discussion of meats.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:50.360]   And I think figuring out how to get high-quality meat would seem to be in a more important
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.160]   discussion than figuring out whether to avoid or not to have meat.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:01.920]   A lot of times you get into the debates over vegetarianism and meat eating, but I think
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:08.600]   if the parallels between somebody who's a vegetarian and they eat lots of high-quality
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.720]   vegetables and high-quality fruits that are packed with nutrients because they're grown
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   in a biodynamically alive environment, and you were to compare them to somebody who eats
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:27.000]   a whole lot of meat, but all of that meat comes from sick animals who are raised in
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.320]   very unhealthy environments.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   And the only way that meat can be cleaned up is to add all kinds of chemicals and bleach
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.920]   and chlorine and whatnot to make it safe.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.420]   I'll take the vegetarianism.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.880]   But if on the other hand, you're comparing somebody who eats vegetables and meat that
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.760]   are from pretty clean sources and the meat is really carefully raised and it's really
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:54.360]   carefully treated and it's made by healthy animals versus the vegetarian who just eats
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:49:00.760]   those depleted vegetables and stuffs their face with potato chips all day long, that
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.200]   just doesn't seem to me to strike very good.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.280]   It doesn't seem like it's going to work out really well.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.720]   So I think the quality is a big, big deal.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.560]   So one was quality nutrition and adequate hydration, of course.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:17.280]   A lot of people lose weight and live longer just by drinking more water.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.400]   But that seems to be number one, quality nutrition and adequate hydration.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.640]   You develop those concepts in whatever way makes you feel best.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:32.060]   But I think if we focused on that word quality and tried to understand different applications
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:36.640]   of it to our vegetables and our grains and our meat, I think we'd get a long way.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:43.240]   I think that, in my opinion, is the 20% that gets at 80% of the results.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.600]   And I'll let the scientists debate the rest of this stuff.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.240]   Quality nutrition, adequate hydration.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.040]   Number two, of course, is low toxicity environments.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:58.680]   Now toxins seem to me to be bad things because your body has to filter out those toxins.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.720]   It's got to figure out how to make those things better.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:07.000]   Now here, the toxins can be many, many things.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.380]   We usually think about the toxins that come in from our foods, maybe.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.520]   Those toxins, of course, could be many things.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.680]   It could be from the toxins of the preservatives that are put in the food to make it sit for
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.040]   two years on the shelf and not fall apart.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.200]   But it could also be the toxin from the E. coli that's living on the surface of the thing
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:31.960]   that you didn't get rid of when you washed or prepared the food, or salmonella, or improper
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.000]   cooking or improper care for food.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.680]   So those are both toxins, in my opinion.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.920]   But toxins are not only those things that are absorbed in our food.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.540]   They're also those things that are absorbed in our water.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:48.200]   Whether it's the water that we drink, perhaps your water has chlorine in it or fluoride,
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.720]   I think those things should be taken out.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.320]   Or whether it's the toxins that we bathe in, the chlorine in the water that is absorbed
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   through our skin.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.640]   It just doesn't strike me to be a very good thing.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.360]   I don't think my body is meant to absorb chlorine constantly.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:11.440]   Unfortunately, though, the discussion about toxins isn't as simple as simply the food
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.120]   or the water and trying to figure those things out.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.760]   Toxins are everywhere.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.200]   Whether it's the candle on the table that's just pumping out a bunch of junk and chemicals
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.080]   that you're then inhaling, that's a concern.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.400]   Most of us don't think about that.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.120]   Whether it's the air freshener that's sprayed in the bathroom or the fragrance that's in
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.960]   the soap, some people are super sensitive to that stuff.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.580]   Some people aren't, but still, at the end of the day, it just seems like a toxin.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:39.040]   Whether it's the electromagnetic radiation that, you know, if I sleep next to the router,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.080]   the wireless router that's just pumping out electrical energy all night, that doesn't
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.800]   seem like a good plan to me.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.620]   You know, hanging out, living with my cell phone to my ear eight hours a day, regardless
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:58.600]   of what the current study that I can put my hand on, it doesn't seem like a good idea
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   to me.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.560]   Electromagnetic radiation or whatever that stuff is.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.280]   You know, of course, there's some people that are very sensitive and some people aren't,
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.880]   but to me that also makes sense.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.340]   It makes sense that some people's bodies are going to be weak and not able to fend those
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.400]   things off, and some people's bodies are going to be strong.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.440]   But figuring out how to limit toxins in our environment seems to me like a pretty good
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   idea.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.880]   Now, how you apply that, I don't know, but anything that goes into your body that your
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:33.000]   body can't use for positive food to build itself, it's got to be removed.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.680]   And if your body's spending all kinds of time removing things, it's going to do that well,
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:47.440]   but at some point it seems like to me like it could get tired and it could just get overloaded.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.800]   So I don't know where the range is where asbestos causes one thing and electromagnetic radiation
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.540]   causes another, but I do think we probably should just take a careful look at eliminating
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:07.840]   toxins and have a healthy skepticism about most of those things and figure out how to
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.920]   minimize the toxins and the things that attack us.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.320]   Finally, number three, adequate physical movement.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:22.380]   Seems pretty clear to me that getting a lot of movement is a good thing, but I think either
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:27.800]   extreme is probably damaging, but damaging in a different way.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:32.680]   Most of us, of course, are far too sedentary and just about everything associated with
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.520]   a sedentary lifestyle seems to be destructive.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.920]   It doesn't seem like the human body is designed for sitting constantly.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.800]   So most of us probably just need to figure out how to move more.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:51.160]   Now on the other end, it seems to me like there's a little bit of excess from those
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.520]   who move a lot in some really repetitive ways.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:00.200]   I've known a number of Ironman triathletes and it seems like they all got a bunch of
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   injuries.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   Now, is that required?
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   Probably not.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   Could you do it safely?
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.320]   No, but anything that's super extreme also seems like we should be careful.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:13.280]   But from there, you're on your own.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.920]   Now if I'm wrong and you have information, I would actually invite you to talk to me
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.040]   and I'll be happy to bring you on and discuss this with you.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.000]   But of course, there's such a plethora of discussions on these topics already.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:33.080]   I don't know that that particular area is a good way for me to focus right now.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.800]   But I will say this, financially I struggle to figure out where to invest my money in
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   health.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.160]   I've heard anecdotes.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:46.240]   I remember Joel Salatin gave some percentages one time in one of his talks or books that
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   I read.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.560]   I can't cite the exact data, so hold it something like this.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:57.360]   And he said something, 150 years ago, the average US American spent, and again, these
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.640]   aren't the exact numbers.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.600]   This is directionally appropriate enough to drive the point home.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:08.560]   The average US American spent 25% of their budget on food and 5% of their budget on health
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.800]   expenses.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:16.000]   Today the average American spends 5% of their budget on food and 25% of their budget on
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.460]   health expenses.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.920]   So we don't spend any less money on our health, we just spend it in the wrong way.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:27.160]   Spend it on healthcare or sick care instead of food.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.240]   That makes sense to me.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   I can see that.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   I think that's right.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.120]   Whatever the data actually is, I think that's directionally right.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:43.320]   What I find difficult to figure out is where your dollars are best spent.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:51.880]   On food, that is of course one of a big category that we face that changes on a monthly basis.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.400]   Many financial categories such as your housing expense, your rent, or your mortgage payment,
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.360]   those are fixed by big decisions that you've made.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.440]   You can change them, but once you change them, then they're going to become fixed again.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.560]   But food changes every week, every month.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.400]   It's a fresh decision every time.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.120]   You're standing in the grocery store saying, "Should I buy the organic carrots or the conventional
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.120]   carrots?
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:17.960]   Should I buy the butter from grass-fed cows or butter from grain-fed cows?"
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.080]   Standing in the meat department, "Should I buy the grass-fed bison or should I buy
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.560]   the conventional factory-raised chicken?"
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.680]   Looking at your eggs, "Should I buy the cage-free eggs?
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.120]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.440]   Or should I buy the conventional?"
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.320]   It's maddening to me because I find it a very frustrating decision tree because I don't
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.480]   know what makes the biggest difference.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   I don't know.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.640]   I want to spend more money on food because I think that'll make a bigger health, but
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.200]   I don't know what to spend it on.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.920]   So if you have any ideas on this subject, here's the specific question that I'd be happy
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   to hear from you on.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.360]   You can email me, use the contact form on the website at joshuatradicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:04.600]   You can comment on today's show, but let me know how you would describe these things,
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.720]   especially if you have a background in medical expertise.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.200]   I'd love to hear your opinion.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.160]   If you were going to increase, let's say that your family spends, I'll use my numbers, your
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:17.280]   family spends, well, depending on the month, $400 to $500 a month on food.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.640]   Let's say that you're going to change your food budget and you're going to go intentionally
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:25.520]   from $500 to $1,000, let's double it.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:30.000]   Let's say you're going to double your food budget, $500 to $1,000 a month.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.880]   And you're doing that for the purpose of good health.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.800]   My question to you is this, what would you spend that money on?
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:45.920]   Would you spend an extra $100 a month on vitamins, supplements, green concoctions, extra nutritional
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   stuff?
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.520]   Would you switch all your vegetables from conventional to organic?
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:57.040]   Would you move all your meat purchases from farm-raised to wild sources?
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.720]   Would you buy a grass-fed beef cow?
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.360]   Would you quit eating meat so you could eat more grains?
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   What would you do?
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   I'd love to hear from you.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:10.200]   There's a problem I've struggled with for a long time and it's, in my mind, a maddening
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   problem.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.360]   But I hope you consider your own situation and hope in conclusion of today's show that
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.540]   these simple ideas are helpful for you for health-related factors.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.720]   My ideas are this.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.940]   One, quality nutrition and adequate hydration is essential.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:31.160]   And by focusing on the word quality, I think that you and I are equipped to make reasonable,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.360]   common sense decisions without having to try to consult the 37 new medical studies that
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.200]   were published this month.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.440]   Just look at something and say, "Is this quality?
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.320]   Is this of high quality?"
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:51.740]   Number two, seeking to live in a low-toxicity environment, pulling out toxins, whatever
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.800]   those toxins are, taking a look at the cleaners under your sink.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   What's in that?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.140]   What is the chemical in that?
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.540]   Taking a look at the stuff that's in the air.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   What's in that?
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.540]   What do I smell?
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   What's coming off of my walls?
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.180]   What's coming out of that candle on the table?
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:10.980]   What's coming in the window from the factory next door?
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:15.300]   And then number three, making sure that we get adequate and significant physical movement
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:20.740]   that seems to be in line with the way that humans are designed to move.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.740]   Take those ideas.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:28.180]   I hope they help you because at the end of the day, the major leading causes of death
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.660]   are all related to health.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.420]   So if you want to protect your finances, make sure that your insurance policy was a waste
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.460]   of money, kind of figure out what to do about those lifestyle diseases.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.820]   If you want to make sure that your family is continuing to enjoy your presence, kind
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.780]   of figure out what to do about those lifestyle diseases.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:49.960]   They're far more important than worrying about getting shot by a gun or worrying about getting
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   in a car accident.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   We'll cover those another time.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   Thank you for listening.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   I hope this information has been helpful.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   Big Boy's Comedy Kings is coming to Yamava Resort and Casino Saturday, December 9th with
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   D.L. Hughley.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   That sweater so tight, look like a snot between the legs.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.960]   Cedric the Entertainer.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.960]   Once we stop running, I'll find out what it was.
[00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960]   I'll find out what it was.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.540]   Once we stop running, I'll find out what it was we was running about.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.540]   And Paul Rodriguez.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540]   What is it about old Mexican men?
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   They could be missing a leg, they still want to get into a fight.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:17.540]   Hosted by my man Eric Blake and a special performance by Mario.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.820]   Big Boy's Comedy Kings, December 9th at Yamava Resort and Casino.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.580]   Tickets can be purchased at AXS.com.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.540]   This is a 21 and over event.
