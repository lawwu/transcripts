[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   - Your most recent book titled
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.780]   Einstein's Unfinished Revolution.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.240]   So I have to ask, what is Einstein's Unfinished Revolution
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.480]   and also how do we finish it?
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.600]   - Well that's something I've been trying to do
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.440]   my whole life.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.240]   But Einstein's Unfinished Revolution
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.900]   is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory,
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.200]   special and especially general relativity.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.320]   And quantum theory, which he was the first person
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.720]   to realize in 1905,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.960]   there would have to be a radically different theory
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.360]   which somehow realized or resolved the paradox
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   of the duality of particle and wave for photons.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   - And he was, I mean, people I think don't always
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.240]   associate Einstein with quantum mechanics
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.440]   'cause I think his connection with it,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.480]   founding as one of the founders, I would say,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.520]   of quantum mechanics, he kind of put it in the closet.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.360]   Is it--
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.040]   - Well he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.200]   as it was developed in the late 19, middle late 1920s
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   was completely correct.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.200]   At first he didn't believe it at all.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   Then he was convinced that it's consistent but incomplete
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.300]   and that also is my view.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.080]   It needs, for various reasons I can elucidate,
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.060]   to have additional degrees of freedom,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.720]   particles, forces, something, to reach the stage
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.000]   where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.640]   as I was saying, realism demands.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.360]   - So what aspect of quantum mechanics
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960]   bothers you and Einstein the most?
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   Is it some aspect of the wave function collapse discussions,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.900]   the measurement problem?
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.700]   Is it the--
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.160]   - The measurement problem.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.120]   I'm not gonna speak for Einstein.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.740]   (Lex laughing)
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.900]   The measurement problem basically and the fact that--
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.140]   - What is the measurement problem, sorry?
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.900]   - The basic formulation of quantum mechanics
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.140]   gives you two ways to evolve situations in time.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940]   One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.220]   or no measurement is taking place
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.740]   and the other is when a measurement
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.500]   or an observation is taking place
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.980]   and they basically contradict each other.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760]   But there's another reason why the revolution
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.720]   was incomplete which is we don't understand
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.240]   the relationship between these two parts.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.720]   General relativity which became our best theory
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   of space and time and gravitation and cosmology
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.600]   and quantum theory.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.120]   - So for the most part, general relativity
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000]   describes big things, quantum theory describes
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.720]   little things and that's the revolution
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.400]   that we found really powerful tools
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.080]   to describe big things and little things
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.000]   and it's unfinished because we have two totally
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   separate things and we need to figure out
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.400]   how to connect them so it can describe everything.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.880]   - Right and we either do that if we believe
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.960]   quantum mechanics as understood now is correct
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.120]   by bringing general relativity or some extension
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.520]   of general relativity that describes gravity
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.880]   and so forth into the quantum domain
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   that's called quantized theory of gravity
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   or if you believe with Einstein that quantum mechanics
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.440]   needs to be completed and this is my view,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920]   then part of the job of finding the right completion
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.800]   or extension of quantum mechanics would be one
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.380]   that incorporated space time and gravity.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.960]   - So where do we begin?
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.640]   So first let me ask, perhaps you can give me a chance
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.120]   if I could ask you some just really basic questions.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.560]   Well, they're not at all.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.900]   The basic questions are the hardest
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.760]   but you mentioned space time.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920]   What is space time?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.280]   - Space time, you talked about a construction.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.440]   So I believe that space time is an intellectual construction
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.240]   that we make of the events in the universe.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.720]   I believe the events are real and the relationships
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.760]   between the events which cause which are real.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.520]   But the idea that there's a four dimensional
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   smooth geometry which has a metric and a connection
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360]   and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.420]   it's a good description to some scale.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.840]   It's a good approximation.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.120]   It captures some of what's really going on in nature.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   But I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.460]   - So okay, we're gonna, allow me to linger on that.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.800]   So the universe has events.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.760]   Events cause other events.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.080]   This is the idea of causality.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.880]   Okay, so that's real.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.560]   In your view, it's real.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.120]   - Or hypothesis or the theories that I have been
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.240]   working to develop make that assumption.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.360]   - So space time, you said four dimensional space
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.240]   is kind of the location of things
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   and time is whatever the heck time is.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   And you're saying that space time is,
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.480]   both space and time are emergent and not fundamental?
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.320]   - No.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.500]   - Sorry, before you correct me,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.820]   what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.540]   - Fundamental means it's part of the description
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.220]   as far down as you go.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.460]   We have this notion. - As real.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.300]   - Yes.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   - As real as real it could be.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.220]   - Yeah, so I think that time is fundamental
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.500]   and quote goes all the way down.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.520]   And space does not.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.720]   And the combination of them we use in general relativity
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.880]   that we call space time also does not.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.160]   - But what is time then?
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   - I think that time, the activity of time
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.440]   is the continual creation of events from existing events.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.600]   - So if there's no events, there's no time.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.120]   - Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.960]   - So--
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.840]   - So I believe the universe has a history
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.820]   which goes to the past.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.760]   I believe the future does not exist.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.540]   There's a notion of a present and a notion of the past.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.400]   And the past consists of, is a story about events
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.680]   that took place to our past.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.560]   - So you said the future doesn't exist.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.400]   - Yes.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.240]   - Could you say that again?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.160]   Can you try to give me a chance to understand that
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.320]   one more time?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.520]   So the events cause other events.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.440]   What is this universe?
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.600]   'Cause we'll talk about locality and non-locality.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.140]   - Good.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.160]   - 'Cause it's a crazy, I mean it's not crazy,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   it's a beautiful set of ideas that you propose.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.680]   But if causality is fundamental,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.140]   I'd just like to understand it better.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.020]   What is the past, what is the future,
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.600]   what is the flow of time, even the error of time
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.700]   in our universe, in your view?
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.340]   And maybe what's an event?
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.080]   Right?
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.400]   - Oh, an event is where something changes.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   Or where to, it's hard to say
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.240]   because it's a primitive concept.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   An event is a moment of time within space.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.500]   This is the view in general relativity,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.480]   where two particles intersect in their paths
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.760]   or something changes in the path of a particle.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.620]   Now we are postulating that there is,
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.640]   at the fundamental level, a notion,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.260]   which is an elementary notion,
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.500]   so it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things,
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.800]   but it is something elementary happening.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.400]   - And it doesn't have a connection to energy or matter
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   or exchange of any--
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.160]   - It does have a connection to energy and matter.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.720]   - So it's at that level.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.040]   - Yes, it involves, and that's why the version
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.740]   of a theory of events that I've developed
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.600]   with Marina Cortes, and by the way,
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.080]   I wanna mention my collaborators
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.960]   because they've been at least as important
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.840]   in this work as I have.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   It's Marina Cortes in all the works since about 2013,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.540]   2012, 2013 about causality, causal sets,
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.260]   and in the period before that, Roberto Manghibera-Anger,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.820]   who is a philosopher and a professor of law.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.940]   - And that's in your efforts together
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.140]   with your collaborators to finish the unfinished revolution.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.980]   - Yes.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.620]   - And focus on causality as a fundamental--
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   - Yes.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.580]   - As fundamental to physics.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.100]   So--
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.420]   - And there's certainly other people we've worked with,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.740]   but those two people's thinking
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.960]   had a huge influence on my own thinking.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.820]   - So in the way you describe causality,
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.500]   that's what you mean of time being fundamental,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.580]   that causality is fundamental.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.420]   - Yes.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.380]   - And what does it mean for space to not be fundamental,
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.220]   to be emergent?
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.040]   - That's very good.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.660]   There's a level of description in which there are events,
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.140]   there are events create other events,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.780]   but there's no space, they don't live in space.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.060]   They have an order in which they caused each other,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.620]   and that is part of the nature of time for us.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   But there is an emergent approximate description,
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.140]   and you asked me to define emergent, I didn't.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:51.180]   An emergent property is a property
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.500]   that arises at some level of complexity,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.260]   larger than and more complex than the fundamental level,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.140]   which requires some property to describe it,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.980]   which is not directly
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.620]   explicable or derivable is the word I want,
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.660]   from the properties of the fundamental things.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.860]   - And space is one of those things
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.180]   in a sufficiently complex universe,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.180]   space, three-dimensional position of things emerged.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.980]   - Yes, and we have this, we saw how this happens in detail
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.660]   in some models, both computationally and analytically.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.260]   - Okay, so connected to space is the idea of locality.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.100]   - Yes.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.260]   - So we've talked about realism.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.860]   So I live in this world, I like sports,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.860]   locality is a thing that you can affect things close to you
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.860]   and don't have an effect on things that are far away.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.900]   It's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.100]   or action at a distance,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.420]   same thing that probably bothered Newton,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.120]   or at least he said a little bit about it.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.620]   Okay, so what do you think about locality?
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.020]   Is it just a construct?
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.700]   Is it us humans just like this idea
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.100]   and are connected to it because we exist
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.140]   and we need it for our survival, but it's not fundamental?
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.940]   I mean, it seems crazy for it not to be
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.940]   a fundamental aspect of our reality.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.780]   - It does.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.880]   - Can you comfort me, sort of as a therapist?
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.500]   - I'm not a good therapist, but I'll do my best.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.860]   There are several different definitions of locality
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.660]   when you come to talk about locality in physics.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.540]   In quantum field theory, which is a mixture
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.660]   of special relativity and quantum mechanics,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.680]   there is a precise definition of locality.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.600]   Field operators corresponding to events in space-time,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.980]   which are space-like, separated,
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.500]   commute with each other as operators.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.260]   - So in quantum mechanics, you think about
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.220]   the nature of reality as fields,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.820]   and things that are close in a field
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.060]   have an impact on each other more than farther away.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.260]   - That's, yes.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.620]   - That's very comforting.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.460]   That makes sense.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.420]   - So that's a property of quantum field theory,
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.380]   and it's well-tested.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.960]   Unfortunately, there's another definition of local,
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.700]   which was expressed by Einstein
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.140]   and expressed more precisely by John Bell,
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.780]   which has been tested experimentally and found to fail.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.660]   And this setup is you take two particles.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.040]   So one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.560]   is a property called entanglement.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.980]   You can have two particles interact
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.740]   and then share a property without it being a property
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.500]   of either one of the two particles.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.540]   And if you take such a system,
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.500]   and then you make a measurement on particle A,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.140]   which is over here on my right side,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.300]   and particle B, which is over here,
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.800]   somebody else makes a measurement on particle B,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.180]   you can ask that whatever is the real reality of particle B,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.020]   it not be affected by the choice
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.700]   the observer at particle A makes about what to measure.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.140]   Not the outcome, just the choice
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.720]   of the different things they might measure.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.460]   And that's a notion of locality,
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.540]   because it assumes that these things are very far spaced,
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.460]   like separated, and it's gonna take a while
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.280]   for any information about the choice made
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.140]   by the people here at A to affect the reality at B.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.660]   But you make that assumption, that's called Bell locality.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.180]   And you derive a certain inequality
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.020]   that some correlations, functions of correlations
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.080]   have to satisfy.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.420]   And then you can test that pretty directly
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.340]   in experiments which create pairs of photons
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.060]   or other particles.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.860]   And it's wrong by many sigma.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.940]   - In experiment, it doesn't match.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.900]   So what does that mean?
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.900]   - That means that that definition
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.500]   of locality I stated is false.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.900]   - The one that Einstein was playing with?
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.780]   - Yeah, and the one that I stated,
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.820]   that is, it's not true that whatever is real
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.740]   about particle B is unaffected by the choice
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.020]   that the observer makes as to what to measure
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.620]   in particle A, no matter how long they've been propagating
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.020]   at almost the speed of light,
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.500]   or the speed of light away from each other.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.020]   - It don't matter, so like the distance between them?
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.680]   - Well, it's been tested, of course.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.580]   If you want to have hope for quantum mechanics
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.340]   being incomplete or wrong and corrected
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.500]   by something that changes this,
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.920]   it's been tested over a number of kilometers.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.460]   I don't remember whether it's 25 kilometers
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.180]   or 100 and something kilometers.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.180]   - So in trying to solve the unsolved revolution,
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.220]   in trying to come up with a theory for everything,
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.580]   is causality fundamental
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.580]   and breaking away from locality?
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.420]   - Absolutely.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.460]   - A crucial step.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.060]   So in your book, essentially, those are the two things
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.860]   we really need to think about as a community,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.140]   especially the physics community has to think about this.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.720]   I guess my question is, how do we solve,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.180]   how do we finish the unfinished revolution?
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.780]   - Well, that's, I can only tell you what I'm trying to do,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.400]   and what I have abandoned.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.100]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.900]   - As it's not working.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.940]   - As one ant, smart ant in an ant colony.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.980]   Or maybe dumb, that's why, who knows?
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.300]   But anyway, my view of the,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.140]   we've had some nice theories invented.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.260]   There's a bunch of different ones,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.660]   both relate to quantum mechanics,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.940]   relate to quantum gravity.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.820]   There's a lot to admire in many of these different approaches
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.620]   but to my understanding,
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.860]   none of them completely solve the problems
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.120]   that I care about.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.060]   And so we're in a situation
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.860]   which is either terrifying for a student
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.000]   or full of opportunity for the right student,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.620]   in which we've got more than a dozen attempts,
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.180]   and I never thought, I don't think anybody anticipated
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.980]   it would work out this way, which worked partly,
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.660]   and then at some point, they have an issue
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.940]   that nobody can figure out how to go around,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.000]   or how to solve.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.140]   And that's the situation we're in.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.580]   My reaction to that is twofold.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.700]   One of them is to try to bring people,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.980]   we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.860]   in which there are communities
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.740]   around some of these approaches.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.820]   And to borrow again a metaphor from Eric,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.060]   they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.460]   and throw rocks at each other.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.940]   And as Eric says, we need two things.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.500]   We need people to get off their hills
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.740]   and come down into the valleys and party and talk
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.980]   and become friendly and learn to say
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.900]   not no but, but yes and.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.740]   Yes, your idea goes this far,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.860]   but maybe if we put it together with my idea,
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.020]   we can go further.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.860]   - Yes.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.380]   So in that spirit, I've talked several times
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.780]   with Sean Carroll, who's also written
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.300]   an excellent book recently.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.940]   And he kind of, he plays around,
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.060]   is a big fan of the many worlds interpretation
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.500]   of quantum mechanics.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   So I'm a troublemaker, so let me ask,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.340]   what's your sense of Sean
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.060]   and the idea of many worlds interpretation?
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.820]   I've read many, the commentary back and forth.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.860]   You guys are friendly, respect each other,
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.460]   but have a lot of fun debating.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.340]   - I love Sean and he, no, I really,
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.340]   he's articulate and he's a great representative
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.180]   or ambassador of science to the public
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.340]   for different fields of science to each other.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.340]   He also, like I do, takes philosophy seriously.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.420]   And unlike what I do in all cases,
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.500]   he's really done the homework.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.180]   He's read a lot, he knows the people,
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   he talks to them, he exposes his arguments to them.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.580]   And I, there's this mysterious thing
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.740]   that we so often end up on the opposite sides
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.860]   of one of these issues.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.100]   - It's fun, though.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.780]   - It's fun and I'd love to have a conversation about that,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.180]   but I would want to include him.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.700]   - I see, about many worlds.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.140]   Well-- - No, I can tell you
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.100]   what I think about many worlds.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.260]   - I'd love to, but actually on that, let me pause.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.020]   Sean has a podcast, you should definitely figure out
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.780]   how to talk to Sean.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.100]   I actually told Sean I would love to hear you guys
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   just going back and forth.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.580]   So I hope you can make that happen eventually,
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.420]   you and Sean.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.640]   - I won't tell you what it is,
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.180]   but there's something that Sean said to me
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.180]   in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   But I have to tell him first.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.340]   - Yes, and that'll be great to tell him on his podcast.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.180]   So. (laughs)
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.340]   - I can't invite myself to his podcast.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.600]   - I told him, yeah, okay, we'll make it happen.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.780]   So many worlds. - So anyway.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.580]   - What's your view?
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.860]   Many worlds, we talked about non-locality.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.860]   Many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.460]   or beautiful, depending on your perspective.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.460]   It's very nice in terms of,
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.620]   I mean, there's a realist aspect to it,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.580]   I think you called it magical realism.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.300]   - Yes. (laughs)
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.740]   - Just a beautiful line.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.860]   But at the same time, it's very difficult
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.380]   to for our limited human minds to comprehend.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.240]   So what are your thoughts about it?
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.660]   - Let me start with the easy and obvious
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.740]   and then go to the scientific.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.260]   - Okay.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.540]   - It doesn't appeal to me.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.740]   It doesn't answer the questions that I want answered.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.500]   And it does so to such a strong case
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.300]   that when Roberto Manguibar-Angur and I
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.980]   began looking for principles,
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.420]   and I wanna come back and talk about
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.620]   the use of principles in science,
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.220]   'cause that's the other thing I was gonna say,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.620]   and I don't wanna lose that.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.660]   When we started looking for principles,
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.700]   we made our first principle, there is just one world,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.040]   and it happens once.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.900]   But so it's not helpful to my personal approach,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.060]   to my personal agenda.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.340]   But of course I'm part of a community.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.060]   And my sense of the many worlds interpretation,
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.840]   I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.900]   is the following.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.860]   First of all, there's Everett himself,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.420]   there's what's in Everett.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.620]   And there are several issues there
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.940]   connected with the derivation of the Born Rule,
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.980]   which is the rule that gives probabilities to events.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.460]   And the reasons why there is a problem with probability
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.500]   is that I mentioned the two ways
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.300]   that physical systems can evolve.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.380]   The many worlds interpretation cuts off,
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.140]   one, the one having to do with measurement,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.780]   and just has the other one, the Schrodinger evolution,
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.060]   which is this smooth evolution of the quantum state.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.740]   But the notion of probability is only in the second rule,
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.860]   which we've thrown away.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.620]   So where does probability come from?
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.980]   You have to answer the question,
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.700]   because experimentalists use probabilities
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.940]   to check the theory.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:34.060]   Now, at first sight you get very confused,
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.540]   'cause there seems to be a real problem.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.940]   Because in the many worlds interpretation,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.500]   this talk about branches is not quite precise,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.540]   but I'll use it.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.260]   There's a branch in which everything that might happen
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.860]   does happen, with probability one in that branch.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.460]   You might think you could count the number of branches
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.260]   in which things do and don't happen,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.380]   and get numbers that you can define
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.900]   as something like frequentist probabilities.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.240]   And Everett did have an argument in that direction.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.300]   But the argument gets very subtle
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.820]   when there are an infinite number of possibilities,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   as is the case in most quantum systems.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.260]   And my understanding, although I'm not as much of an expert
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.460]   as some other people, is that Everett's own proposal
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.460]   failed, did not work.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.460]   There are then, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.580]   There is an important idea that Everett didn't know about,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.300]   which is decoherence, and it is a phenomenon
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.660]   that might be very much relevant.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.180]   And so a number of people post-Everett
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.340]   have tried to make versions of what you might call
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.300]   many worlds quantum mechanics.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.740]   And this is a big area, and it's subtle,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.140]   and it's not the kind of thing that I do well.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.260]   So I consulted, that's why there's two chapters on this
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.300]   in the book I wrote, chapter 10,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.800]   which is about Everett's version, and chapter 11.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.640]   There's a very good group of philosophers
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.160]   of physics in Oxford.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.140]   Simon Saunders, David Wallace, Harvey Brown,
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.820]   and a number of others.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.160]   And of course, there's David Deutsch, who is there.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.560]   And those people have developed and put a lot of work
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   into a very sophisticated set of ideas
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.640]   designed to come back and answer that question.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.480]   They have the flavor of, there are really no probabilities,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.800]   we admit that, but imagine if the Everett story was true
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.840]   and you were living in that multiverse,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.040]   how would you make bets?
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.720]   And so they use decision theory
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   from the theory of probability and gambling and so forth
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.120]   to shape a story of how you would bet
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.600]   if you were inside an Everettian universe and you knew that.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.000]   And there is a debate among those experts
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.660]   as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.840]   And when I checked in as I was finishing the book
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   with some of those people, like Simon,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.640]   who's a good friend of mine, and David Wallace,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.320]   they told me that they weren't sure
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.200]   that any of them was yet correct.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.880]   So that's what I put in my book.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.160]   Now, to add to that, Sean has his own approach
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.760]   to that problem in what's called self-referencing
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.480]   or self-locating observers.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.680]   And it doesn't, I tried to read it
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.540]   and it didn't make sense to me,
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.160]   but I didn't study it hard,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.520]   I didn't communicate with Sean,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.020]   I didn't do the things that I would do,
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.360]   so I had nothing to say about it in the book.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.840]   And I don't know whether it's right or not.
