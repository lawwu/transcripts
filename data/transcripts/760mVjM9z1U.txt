[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Pastor John, what does it mean when the Apostle Paul calls Christians to walk by
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.000]   the Spirit or to keep in step with the Spirit? What does Paul mean by these
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.720]   phrases? This morning, Tony, I was reading Galatians 5 as part of my regular walk
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.480]   through the Bible, and every time I come to Galatians 5, I am struck again by this
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.400]   gathering together of statements about how I'm supposed to live by the Spirit.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.920]   Here they are. Verse 16, walk by the Spirit. Verse 18, be led by the Spirit.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.280]   Verse 22, bear the fruit of the Spirit. Verse 25, live by the Spirit. Second in
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.080]   that verse, keep in step with the Spirit. So five different statements, and every
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   time I read them, I say, "Oh Lord, I want to do that. I want to know experientially
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.880]   what does it mean to walk by the Spirit and be led by the Spirit and bear the
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.240]   fruit of the Spirit and live by the Spirit and keep in step with the Spirit?"
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:16.720]   And I think the key is back in Galatians 3, because there we have an
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.880]   instruction about how the Spirit came to us the first time and how it keeps on
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.840]   being supplied. So in chapter 3, verse 2, it says, "Did you receive the Spirit by
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.680]   works of the law or by hearing with faith?" So it tells you the Spirit came to
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.440]   you through faith the very first time. You receive the Holy Spirit when you
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.200]   put your trust in Christ. That faith became the channel, and I think the
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.960]   Spirit created that channel by which you're united to Christ and the Spirit
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.520]   flows into you by virtue of your union with Christ through faith. And then he
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.920]   says in verse 5, "Does he who supplies..." So now here we've got not the past
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.560]   receiving but the ongoing supply. "Does he who supplies the Spirit and works
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.760]   miracles among you..." And I think that would be not simply signs and
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.200]   wonders kinds of miracles, though that wouldn't be excluded. It's also love, joy,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.880]   peace, patience. I mean, the stuff that really makes us frustrated that we
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.400]   can't be better at, it's the Spirit that works those. Does he work those
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.520]   by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Exactly the same way we started. So
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.760]   you began by receiving the Spirit by faith, you go on experiencing the supply
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.560]   of the Spirit by faith. So if a person asks, "Well, you sound very passive." Be led
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.480]   by the Spirit, bear fruit of the Spirit, and they are. I mean, the Spirit is God.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.400]   He does things on us and in us, but the thing we're called to do is to hear, and
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.240]   I think that would mean hear the Word of God, hear the promises of God, hear the
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.080]   Gospel of God, and believe it, and on that belief, through that belief, the Holy
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.280]   Spirit comes. And so very practically, here's the way I think it works. At
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.440]   least this is the way I try to walk by the Spirit, be led by the Spirit, bear the
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.480]   fruit of the Spirit. One of the fruits of the Spirit, and you can walk
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   through all nine this way, one of them is patience. So the fruit of the Spirit is
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   patience. When the Holy Spirit is leading John Piper, when he's bearing fruit in
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.440]   John Piper's life, when John Piper is walking in step with the Spirit, he's
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.640]   patient. Now, what makes you want to be impatient? Something comes into your life,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.720]   crosses your will, plans don't go the way you want, you get frustrated, people say
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.680]   something, you were intended to be somewhere and the traffic is thick, and
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.880]   there rises up in you this frustration or this anger or this disappointment, and
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.680]   it's a manifestation of impatience. Now what are you supposed to do right
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.160]   there? You're supposed to trust, you're supposed to believe, you're supposed to
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   hear something with faith. And the promiseâ€”there are a lot of promises that
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.760]   relate to patience. I'm gonna work all this together for your good. Remember the
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.400]   story of Joseph, how he would have surely been frustrated and wanted to be
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.240]   impatient for all those 13 years things seemed to be going terrible for him,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.840]   and God was taking him to the vice presidency of Egypt to save a people.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.400]   And you remind yourself, God is sovereign, God is wise, God is good, God is in charge
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.120]   of the traffic, God's in charge of the airline schedules, God's in charge of
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.160]   what people say about you or to you, and you trust him. You, by an act of
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   faith, you say, "God, I trust you, I believe you, you sent your son to die
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.360]   for me, you purchased this promise for me, and I will now trust you." And in the
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.760]   resting of that faith, the Spirit is at work. That's his work, in and through that
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.960]   faith. So the restfulness of faith in the traffic jam is the fruit of the Holy
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.040]   Spirit. And then I asked myself one more question this morning. I
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   said, "Why would God do it that way? Why would he attach the work of
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.760]   the Spirit, the supply of the Spirit, to my trustfulness in Christ and his
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.240]   gospel and his promises?" And I think the answer is that the Spirit, according to
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.120]   John 16, was given to glorify Christ. "I will send him and he will glorify me,"
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.000]   Jesus said. And how does the Spirit glorify Christ except that he works in
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   and through our trusting Christ? Christ does something for us. He dies, he rises,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.800]   he says, "I'll be with you," and he makes promises to us. "I'll help you and I'll
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.360]   strengthen you." And in trusting him, the Holy Spirit gives peace, and thus Christ
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440]   gets the credit. Christ gets the glory, because we're trusting a promise
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.680]   of Christ. So all that was not new to me this morning, Tony. I've written all about
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.560]   that in In Future Grace and other places, but every time I get there, it
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.960]   seems like God just kind of washes over me again with, "Are you doing this, John?
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.880]   Are you living by the Spirit? Are you bearing the fruit of the Spirit?
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   Are you bearing the fruit of the Spirit? Are you keeping in step with
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.080]   the Spirit?" And I have to just pause and say, "Oh God, I can do so much." But I want
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.560]   so much to enjoy fellowship with you in the leading of the Spirit. Yes, thank you,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.720]   Pastor John. And thank you for listening to this podcast. For more on walking by the
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   Spirit, see Pastor John's book, "Future Grace," chapter 12 especially, and also see
