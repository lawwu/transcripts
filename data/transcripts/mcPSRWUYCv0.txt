[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.660]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.800]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.620]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.800]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.920]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.360]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.620]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.960]   Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.360]   that keeps your data secure by routing your data
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080]   and online activities through their servers
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.360]   and keeping your data safe and secure,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.680]   but also not selling your data to third parties.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.000]   I started using ExpressVPN
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.580]   because unfortunately I had my bank accounts hacked.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.880]   I was traveling a lot,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840]   and I typically go on hotel or airline
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.500]   or other public wifi from time to time.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.680]   And I don't know how it happened,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.360]   but somehow my information got out there.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   And as I learned more from my friends
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.760]   and people that work in the tech community,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.600]   turns out that many networks are not secure.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.520]   So with ExpressVPN, it keeps all your information secure.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.120]   It keeps information about your password secure.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.260]   It keeps information about the websites that you visit secure
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.720]   and as I mentioned earlier,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.340]   they never give away or sell your data.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.680]   The nice thing is you can use ExpressVPN.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.000]   It runs in the background
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.060]   and you don't even really realize that it's on.
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.280]   It works on your phone.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   It works on your laptop.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.720]   It even works on your smart TV.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.660]   If you'd like to try ExpressVPN,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.660]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.860]   to get three months free on their one-year program.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.080]   I love ExpressVPN.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.320]   I use it even when I'm at home.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.360]   And so if you want to try it,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.880]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   and you'll get three months free on their one-year program.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.380]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.280]   I started taking Athletic Greens in 2012
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.340]   because I wanted to cover my vitamin and mineral bases.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.840]   I didn't know which things to take.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   I found it really dizzying to know which vitamins
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.320]   and minerals to purchase.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.340]   And Athletic Greens allowed me to get all the things
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.680]   I needed to cover my bases in one easy to consume formula
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.460]   that also happens to taste really good.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.740]   I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.300]   The probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.560]   are also really important to me
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.980]   because now there's an abundance of data
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860]   showing that the gut microbiome,
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.780]   which is supported by probiotics,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.120]   is important for gut brain access,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.000]   mood, metabolic function, hormone function,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   just a huge number of biological functions
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880]   and health parameters.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.400]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.720]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.640]   And if you do that,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.180]   they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.680]   Vitamin D3 also has a lot of support
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.940]   from the scientific literature
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.520]   showing that it's important for immune function.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.320]   So if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.660]   you'll get Athletic Greens
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.020]   plus the year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.200]   and they'll give you five free travel packets.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.040]   Mixing up powders is a little bit messy sometimes
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.880]   when you're on the road.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   You're in the car, you're on the plane,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.360]   or you're on the move.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240]   These travel packets make everything really clean
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.400]   and really easy.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.480]   Once again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.400]   for Athletic Greens, the five free travel packets,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.200]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.780]   Many of you have graciously asked
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.880]   how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.720]   There are several ways that you can do that.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.820]   One is to check out our sponsors.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.280]   The other is we've set up a Patreon account.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.640]   You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.720]   and that allows you to donate to the podcast
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.140]   at a variety of different levels.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.020]   In addition, if you could subscribe
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.920]   to the podcast on YouTube, that's terrific.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.160]   If you haven't done that already, please do so.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400]   And please leave a comment.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   If you want to make suggestions about future episodes,
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   please also put that in the comment section.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.760]   If you subscribe on Apple or Spotify or both, that helps us.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.180]   And as well, Apple gives you the opportunity
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.460]   to leave a review and give us a five-star rating
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.040]   if you feel we deserve a five-star rating.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.600]   And of course, please recommend the podcast
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.640]   to your friends, to your family members,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.440]   anyone that you think would benefit from the information.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   So really the answer to your question
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.280]   of how you can support the podcast
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.200]   is you don't have to buy products,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880]   although checking all the sponsors does help.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.160]   You don't have to donate to Patreon.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.440]   We, of course, can't require you to subscribe
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.640]   and fill out reviews and things of that sort,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.740]   but we like to think that we're providing
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.520]   a number of different ways to support the podcast,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.600]   some of which are zero cost, some of which, if you like,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.680]   gives you the opportunity to contribute financially.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.260]   That's terrific as well.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.220]   So thank you so much.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.560]   We really appreciate your interest
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.740]   in helping us keep this coming your way.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.500]   Let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.420]   this incredible feature of our nervous system
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.280]   that allows it to change itself
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.260]   in response to experience and even in ways
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.160]   that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.660]   That's an incredible feature.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.700]   No other organ in our body has that capability.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.800]   Our nervous system, which governs everything
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.420]   about who we are, how we feel, and what we do,
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.380]   does have that capability.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.040]   The issue is most people don't know
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   how to access neuroplasticity.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.740]   Children readily access neuroplasticity
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.960]   and they don't even realize that they're doing it.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.080]   Adults want neuroplasticity,
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.040]   and so that's what this entire month
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.200]   of the Huberman Lab podcast has been about.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.220]   We've explored neuroplasticity
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.920]   from a variety of different perspectives.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   We talked about representational plasticity.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.640]   We talked about the importance of focus and reward.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.000]   We talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.600]   of the vestibular system,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.380]   how altering our relationship to gravity,
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.100]   and in addition to that, making errors as we try and learn,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.320]   can open up windows to plasticity.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.280]   But we have not really talked so much
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.440]   about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.680]   And thus far, we really haven't talked yet
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.000]   about how to undo things that we don't want.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.280]   I've talked about learning, and I say learn a language,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.320]   learn free throws, learn a particular motor skill, et cetera.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.240]   But what about what we would call unlearning
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.960]   or about removing some aspect of our experience
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.000]   that we don't want?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.440]   And so today, we are going to explore
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.600]   that aspect of neuroplasticity,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   and we are going to do that in the context
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.960]   of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.320]   which is pain regeneration,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.480]   and in some cases, injury to the nervous system.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.760]   Now, for those of you that are fortunate enough
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   to not have or had a concussion,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.920]   or not have or know someone
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.720]   who's experiencing chronic or acute pain,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.360]   I encourage you to stay in here with us
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.740]   because a lot of the information that we are going to cover
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.740]   has direct relevance to neuroplasticity for other purposes.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.120]   We, as always here on this podcast,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.920]   are going to discuss some of the science
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.600]   we get into mechanism,
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.740]   but we also really get at principles.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.500]   Principles are far more important than any one experiment
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.100]   or one description of mechanism,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.180]   and certainly far more important than any one protocol
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.620]   because principles allow you
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.400]   to think about your nervous system
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.020]   and work with it in ways that best serve you.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.620]   They are very flexible batches of information.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.180]   So we are going to talk about the principles
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.240]   of neuroplasticity for removing pain
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.960]   and wound healing and injury.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.360]   We're going to talk about acupuncture of all things.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.660]   We are going to talk about modern medicine's attempt
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.840]   to try and restore youth to the aging
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.440]   or injured or demented brain.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.940]   And we are going to definitely talk about tools.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.960]   Got a lot of tools.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.280]   I consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at Stanford,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.580]   at Harvard Medical School,
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.360]   and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.480]   injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   I do want to be very clear and just remind you
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.260]   that I'm not a medical doctor.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.680]   I'm a professor, so I don't prescribe anything.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.960]   I profess things.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.980]   I have my beliefs,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.500]   but the podcast is for information purposes.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.580]   I do hope that the tools that we discuss
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.600]   will be of benefit to you.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.460]   But as always, you should talk to your doctor
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.760]   or healthcare provider about any tools
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.640]   that you plan to add or are looking to explore,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.280]   as well as anything that you might look to remove
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.560]   from your daily protocols.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.840]   In other words, don't change anything
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.920]   without consulting an expert first.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   You're responsible for your health, not me.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.480]   And I say this not just to protect me,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.800]   but also to protect you.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.440]   So please keep that in mind as we move forward.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.700]   And I'm very excited to share with you this information
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.100]   because I do feel that it can be of great benefit
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.360]   to a number of people.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.860]   So let's start our discussion about pain and sensation
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.140]   and regeneration and wound healing
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.060]   with a discussion about a very important system
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.900]   in the nervous system,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.280]   which is the somatosensory system.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.860]   The somatosensory system is, as the name implies,
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.120]   involved in understanding touch,
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.620]   physical feeling on our body.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.200]   And the simplest way to think about
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.940]   the somatosensory system is that we have little sensors
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.180]   and those sensors come in the form of neurons,
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.640]   nerve cells, that reside in our skin
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.700]   and in the deeper layers below the skin.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.880]   And indeed we do.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.360]   We have some that correspond to,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.980]   and we should say respond to mechanical touch.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.880]   So, you know, pressure on the top of my hand
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.700]   or a pinpoint or other sensors, for instance,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.980]   respond to heat, to cold.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.900]   Some respond to vibration.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.600]   We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.220]   and they take that information
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.420]   and send it down these wires that we call axons
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.960]   in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.380]   and then up to the brain.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.900]   And within the spinal cord and brain,
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.780]   we have centers that interpret that information,
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.920]   that actually makes sense of those electrical signals.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.780]   And this is amazing because none of those sensors
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.100]   has a different unique form of information that it uses.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.820]   It just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.600]   So the nervous system, you somehow decode
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.300]   what a given stimulus on your skin is.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.240]   So maybe it's the wind blowing gently
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.100]   and deflecting some of the hairs on your arm,
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.500]   or maybe it's a sharp pinprick or a hot stove
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.120]   or the warmth of a glowing fire.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.440]   That all arrives in your nervous system
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.680]   in the form of these electrical things
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.820]   we call action potentials, which is just amazing.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.280]   And then the brain computes them and makes sense of them.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.700]   So we have peripheral sensors
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.880]   and we've got stations up in our brain
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.080]   and within our spinal cord
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.060]   that makes sense of all the stuff coming in.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.960]   Pain and the sensation of pain is, believe it or not,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.980]   a controversial word in the neuroscience field.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.740]   People prefer to use the word nociception.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.080]   Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.620]   that detect particular types of stimuli.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.580]   It actually comes from the Latin word nocera,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.900]   which means to harm.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.440]   And why would neuroscientists not want to talk about pain?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.220]   Well, it's very subjective.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.780]   It has a mental component and a physical component.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.880]   We cannot say that pain is simply an attempt
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.640]   to avoid physical harm to the body.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.100]   And here's why.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.080]   They actually can be dissociated from one another.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.460]   A good example would be if, God forbid,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.940]   you were exposed to high levels of radiation,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.440]   such as working with some sort of material
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.020]   that was radioactive or, you know,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.040]   you were near a former radioactive plant
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.580]   or some radiation, excessive x-rays, et cetera,
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.980]   you wouldn't feel any pain during the x-rays.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.820]   In fact, you don't.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.900]   If you've ever had x-rays, as I have,
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.380]   you don't feel anything.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.900]   They put you under that lead blanket,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.740]   they run behind a wall, and then they, in my case,
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.260]   they take these pictures of your teeth
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.580]   and it's really scary because you go,
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.220]   something really terrible must be happening here,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.040]   but you don't feel anything.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.740]   But there can be a lot of tissue damage.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.020]   There can be mutations introduced to cells, et cetera.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.860]   I've had x-rays.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.200]   I'm not saying people shouldn't have x-rays,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.040]   but excessive x-rays certainly are not good
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.520]   for human beings.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.240]   Likewise, with excessive exposure to any radiation.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.940]   So there can be tissue damage
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.700]   without the physical perception
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.840]   or mental perception of pain at all.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.140]   As well, there can be the belief of pain
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.800]   or the feeling of pain without there being tissue damage.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.460]   And there's a famous case that was published
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.540]   in the British Journal of Medicine
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.140]   where a construction worker,
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.420]   I think he fell, is how the story went,
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.420]   and a 14-inch nail went through his boot
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.980]   and up through the boot.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.980]   And he was in excruciating pain,
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.220]   just beyond anything he'd experienced.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.560]   He reported that he couldn't even move in any dimension,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.500]   even a tiny bit, without feeling excruciating pain.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.540]   They brought him into the clinic, into the hospital.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.260]   They were able to cut away the boot
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.940]   and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.180]   and it had actually not impaled the skin at all.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.340]   His visual image of the nail going through his boot
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.260]   gave him the feeling, the legitimate feeling,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.780]   that he was experiencing the pain of a nail
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.980]   going through his foot, which is incredible
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.540]   because it speaks to the power of the mind
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.420]   in this pain scenario.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.020]   And it also speaks to the power of the specificity.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.220]   It's not like he thought that his foot was on fire.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.220]   He thought because he saw a nail going through his foot,
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.060]   what, it was going through his boot,
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.900]   but he thought it was going through his foot,
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.460]   that it was sharp pain of the sort that a nail would produce.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.740]   And there are thousands of these kinds
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.640]   of case reports out there.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.220]   Now, that is not to say that all pain that we experience
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.620]   is in our head, but it really speaks
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.940]   to the incredible capacity that these top-down,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.880]   these higher-level cognitive functions have
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.060]   in interpreting what we're experiencing out in the periphery,
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.580]   even just on the basis of what we see.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.740]   And the example of radiation speaks to the fact
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.600]   that pain and tissue damage are dissociable
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.340]   from one another, okay?
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.340]   So why are we talking about pain
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.460]   during a month on neuroplasticity?
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.260]   Well, it turns out that the pain system offers us
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.160]   a number of different principles that we can leverage
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.040]   to A, ensure that if we are ever injured,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.660]   we are able to understand the difference
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.880]   between injury and pain, because there is a difference,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.100]   that if we're ever in pain,
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.340]   that we can understand the difference
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.740]   between injury and pain,
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.900]   that we will be able to interpret our pain.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.880]   And during the course of today's podcast,
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.000]   from both ends of the spectrum,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.300]   from the periphery at the level of the injury,
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.860]   and through these top-down mental mechanisms.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.580]   A lot of times on this podcast, in fact,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.460]   mostly I tend to center on the physiology,
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.180]   on the really objective things that you can describe
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.300]   and talk about diaphragmatic movement or sunlight
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.260]   of a particular number of photons, et cetera.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.180]   But today's a really exciting opportunity
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.340]   for us to discuss some of the more subjective things.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.780]   Believe it or not, we're going to talk about love.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.920]   A colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.060]   who runs a major pain clinic,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.820]   is working on and has published quality peer-reviewed data
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.360]   on the role of love in modulating the pain response.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.260]   Only there's a twist to it,
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.620]   and I'm not going to reveal it just yet,
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.780]   but it turns out that the specific type of connection
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.700]   one has to a romantic partner actually dictates
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.640]   whether or not their love for them
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.420]   will alleviate physical pain.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.320]   And the effects are really robust.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.780]   It's an amazing literature.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.180]   And so what we're talking about today
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.620]   is plasticity of perception,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.900]   which has direct bearing on emotional pain
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.860]   and has direct bearing on trauma
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.020]   and other things that we've discussed in previous episodes
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.820]   a little bit, but that we're going to explore even more
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.680]   in an entire month about those topics.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.360]   So let's get started in thinking about
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.040]   what happens with pain.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.940]   And I will describe some examples
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.080]   of some kind of extreme cases.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.440]   For instance, I will tell you just now
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.680]   that there is a mutation, a genetic mutation,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.120]   in a particular sodium channel.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.360]   A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.300]   that allows them to fire action potentials.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.680]   It's important to the function of the neuron.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.500]   It's also important for the development of certain neurons.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.300]   And there's a particular mutation.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.900]   There are kids that are born without this sodium channel 1.7
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.220]   if you want to look it up.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.740]   Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.120]   And it is a terrible situation.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.980]   They burn themselves.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.520]   They tend to rest on their limbs too long.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   They don't make the micro adjustments.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.900]   You might see me swiveling around in my chair,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.740]   moving around a lot.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.140]   Those micro adjustments are actually normal,
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.440]   healthy micro adjustments that prevent us
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   from going into pain.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.380]   They don't make those adjustments.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.920]   They don't get the feedback
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.360]   that they're in a particular position.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.860]   And so they never make those adjustments
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.940]   and their joints get destroyed essentially.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.180]   They don't tend to live very long due to accidents.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.860]   It's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.060]   Some people have a mutation in the same channel
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.600]   where they make too much of this channel
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.720]   so they feel too much pain.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.220]   In fact, it's reasonable to speculate
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.620]   that one of the reasons, not all,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.820]   but one of the reasons why people might differ
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.540]   in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.760]   in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.420]   People who make too much of this receptor
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.980]   experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.220]   Now, the good news is there are good drug treatments
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.620]   that can block specifically this sodium channel 1.7.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.820]   And so those people get a lot of relief
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.560]   from taking such drugs.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.740]   So pain and how much pain we are sensitive to
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.740]   or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.340]   And then of course, there are things that we can do
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.920]   to make sure that we experience less pain,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.300]   although pain has this adaptive role.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.720]   So let's talk about some of the features
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.740]   of how we're built physically and how that relates to pain
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.020]   and how we can recover from injury.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   So first of all, we have maps of our body surface
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.900]   in our brain, it's called a homunculus.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.920]   In a rat, believe it or not, I'm not making this up,
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.420]   it's called a ratonculus.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.960]   In Costello, my dog is snoring behind me,
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.600]   it's a dogunculus.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.920]   I could get into the nomenclature and why it's called this,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.620]   but it's basically a representation of the body surface.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.800]   That representation is scaled in a way
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.700]   that matches sensitivity.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.700]   So the areas of your body that are most sensitive
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.700]   have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.220]   Your back is an enormous piece of tissue
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.880]   compared to your fingertip,
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.640]   but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   and the representation of your back in your brain
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.540]   is actually pretty small,
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.660]   whereas the representation of your finger is enormous.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.660]   So how big a brain area is devoted to a given body part
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.980]   is directly related to the density of receptors
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.120]   in that body part, not the size of the body part.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.680]   And that's why if we were to draw your homunculus
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.840]   or Costello's dogunculus,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.880]   what we would find is that certain areas like the lips,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.260]   like the fingertips, like the genitalia,
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.080]   like the eyes and the area around the face
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.260]   would have a huge representation.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.800]   Whereas the back, the torso and areas of the body
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.580]   that are less sensitive
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.920]   are going to have smaller representation.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.940]   So it'd be a very distorted map.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.940]   You can actually know how sensitive a given body part is
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.580]   and how much brain area is devoted to it
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.720]   through what's called two-point discrimination.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.940]   You can do this experiment if you want.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.620]   I think I've described this once or twice before,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.940]   but basically if you have someone put,
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.420]   maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.580]   on your back and touch while you're facing away
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.840]   and they'll ask you how many points they're touching you
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.860]   and you say two,
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.300]   but if they move those closer together, say three inches,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.680]   you're likely to experience it as one point of contact.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.320]   Whereas on your finger, you could play that game all day
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.480]   and as long as there's a millimeter or so spacing,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.760]   you will know that it's two points as opposed to one.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.200]   And that's because there's more pixels,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.560]   more density of receptors.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.360]   This has direct bearing to pain
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.280]   because it says that areas of the body
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.360]   that have denser receptors
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.640]   are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.500]   And where we have more receptors,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.480]   we tend to have more blood vessels and glia,
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.000]   which are these support cells,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.360]   and other cells that lend to the inflammation response.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.000]   And that's really important.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.280]   So just as a rule of thumb,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.240]   areas of your body that are injured,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.840]   that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.120]   likely are going to experience less pain
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   and the literature shows will heal more slowly
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.040]   because they don't have as many cells around
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.520]   to produce inflammation.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.160]   And you might say, wait, I thought inflammation is bad.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.220]   Well, one of the things I really want to get across today
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.100]   is that inflammation is not bad.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.960]   Inflammation out of control is bad,
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.860]   but inflammation is wonderful.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.680]   Inflammation is the tissue repair response.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.920]   And we are going to talk about subjective and objective ways
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.260]   to modulate inflammation after tissue injury,
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.660]   even after just exercise that's been too intense.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.520]   Okay, so you have this map of your body surface,
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.740]   it's sensitive in different ways, now you know why.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.800]   So you've got your neurobiology of somatic sensation 101
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.300]   under your belt now.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.420]   We didn't cover everything,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.620]   but we'll touch on some of the other details
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.080]   as we go forward.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.820]   I thought it might be a nice time to just think about
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.160]   the relationship between the periphery and the central maps
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.220]   in a way that many of you have probably heard about before,
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.500]   which will frame the discussion a little bit better,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.780]   which is phantom limb pain.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.300]   Now, some of you are probably familiar with this,
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.080]   or some other portion of their body amputated,
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.000]   it's not uncommon for those people to feel
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.520]   as if they still have that limb or appendage
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.640]   or piece of their body intact.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.120]   And typically, unfortunately, the sensation of that limb
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.780]   is not one of the limb being nice and relaxed
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.360]   and just there.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.600]   The sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.480]   or is contorted in the specific orientation
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.420]   that it was around the time of the injury.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.460]   So if someone has a blunt force to the hand
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.320]   and they end up having their hand amputated,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.740]   typically they will continue to feel pain
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.800]   in their phantom hand, which is pretty wild.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.820]   And that's because the representation of that hand
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.180]   is still intact in the cortex, in the brain,
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.220]   and it's trying to balance its levels of activity.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.620]   Normally, it's getting what's called
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.180]   proprioceptive feedback.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.100]   Proprioception is just our knowledge
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.580]   of where our limbs are in space.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.460]   It's an extremely important aspect
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.640]   of our somatosensory system.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.600]   And there's no proprioceptive feedback,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.620]   and so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.520]   their levels of activity, and they become very conscious
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.220]   of the phantom limb.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.540]   Now, before my lab was at Stanford, I was at UC San Diego,
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.620]   and one of my colleagues was a guy,
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.540]   everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran,
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.860]   who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.700]   and developing a very simple but very powerful solution
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.940]   to it that speaks to the incredible capacity
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.620]   of top-down modulation.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.640]   And top-down modulation, the ability to use one's brain,
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.960]   cognition, and senses to control pain in the body
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.300]   is something that everyone, not just people missing limbs
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.180]   or in chronic pain, can learn to benefit from
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.540]   because it is a way to tap into our ability
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.140]   to use our mind to control perceptions
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.300]   of what's happening in our body.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.760]   And this is not a mystical statement.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.440]   This is not about mind, I guess, as much as his brain
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.120]   to control our perceptions of our body.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.080]   So what did Ramachandran do?
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:42.540]   put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.420]   such that when they looked in the box
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.140]   and they moved their intact limb, the opposite limb,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.260]   which was a reflection of the intact limb
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.960]   'cause they're missing the opposite limb,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.940]   they would see it as if it was intact.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.020]   And as they would move their intact limb,
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.680]   they would visualize with their eyes
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.340]   the limb that's in the place of the absent limb,
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.660]   so this is all by mirrors, moving around
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom pain.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.060]   And he would tell them and they would direct their hand
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.360]   toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.100]   Then they would exit the mirror box.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.400]   They would take their hand out and they would feel
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.380]   as if the hand was now in its relaxed normal position.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.160]   So you could get real time in moments,
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.020]   remapping of the representation of the hand.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.140]   Now that's amazing.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.460]   This is the kind of thing that all of us
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.860]   would like to be able to do if we are in pain.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.780]   If you stub your toe, if you break your ankle,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.620]   if you take a hard fall on your bike
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.420]   or if you're in chronic pain,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.900]   but it's not a trick, right?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.100]   Because it's real visual imagery
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.820]   to remap your representation of your body surface
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.220]   and where your body is.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.500]   That is something that we could all benefit from
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.960]   because if you do anything for long enough, including live,
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.140]   you're going to experience pain of some sort.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.980]   And this, again, I just want to remind you
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.540]   isn't just about physical injuries and pain.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.120]   This has direct relevance to emotional pain as well,
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.580]   which we, of course, we'll talk about.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.300]   So the Ramachandran studies were really profound
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.540]   because they said a couple of things.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.220]   One, plasticity can be very fast,
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.880]   that it can be driven by the experience of something,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.940]   just the visual experience.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.460]   He had people do this mirror box thing,
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.120]   but not look into the mirror box
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.420]   and they didn't get the remapping.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.900]   So it required visual imagery coming in.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.100]   We also know, for instance,
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.680]   that in cases like where people are congenitally deaf,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.380]   the cochlear implant, which is simply a way of putting,
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.220]   it's not simple, but it's a way of putting in a device
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.640]   that replaces the cochlea,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.380]   the device that we're normally born with in the ear
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.380]   that has these little, what are called hair cells
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.280]   that deflect according to sound waves and allow us to hear
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.420]   by replacing the normal hearing apparatus
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.060]   that's deficient in deaf people with this cochlear implant,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.740]   the brain can make sense of this artificial ear, basically.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.780]   It's not the outside ear, not the pinna, but the inner ear.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.620]   And they can start to hear sounds.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.620]   Now, some people really like the artificial cochlea.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.580]   They really benefit from it.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.920]   It restores their ability to hear and they like it.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.960]   Other people don't.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.420]   Some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything,
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.980]   can be very disruptive to them.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.100]   And some of that might have to do with the need
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.420]   for further, better engineering of these artificial cochleas.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.680]   But all this really speaks to the fact
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.820]   that the brain is an adaptive device.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.140]   It will respond to what you give it.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.020]   It is not a device that is fixed.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.640]   In fact, the essence of the brain,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.900]   especially the human brain, is to take sensory inputs
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.000]   and to make sense of those, meaning cognitive sense,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.700]   and then to interpret those signals.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.180]   And so this may come as a shock to some of you,
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.100]   and by no means am I trying to be insensitive,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.980]   but pain is a perceptual thing
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.900]   as much as it's a physical thing.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.780]   It's a belief system about what you're experiencing
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.220]   in your body, and that has important relevance
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.100]   for healing different types of injury
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.620]   and the pain associated with that injury.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.260]   In people's pursuit for neuroplasticity,
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.820]   a question that comes up every once in a while
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.720]   is people will say, you know, if I just brush my teeth
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.040]   with the opposite hand for a couple nights in a row,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.140]   will I get neuroplasticity?
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.300]   And the answer is probably yes.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.580]   I mean, it's a deliberate action.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.500]   You're focusing on it.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.340]   There's an end goal.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.760]   You're very likely to make errors,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.500]   like dropping an anterior lip and gums at first
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.340]   and then getting better at it.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.180]   And as you heard in last episode,
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.100]   making errors is really important
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.740]   'cause those errors are the signal
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.340]   that plasticity needs to happen.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.200]   And then when you get the actions correct,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.440]   then those correct actions are programmed in.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.220]   I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.100]   with the opposite hand is the most effective use
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.620]   of this incredible thing that we have, which is plasticity.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.460]   It's not going to open up plasticity for many other things.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.340]   So if that were really important to you for whatever reason,
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.900]   maybe you have a crowded bathroom
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.140]   and it's easier to do on one side or the other than fine.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.220]   But it's kind of hard to imagine
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.660]   why this would be a highly adaptive behavior,
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.180]   unless of course you have an injured limb
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.260]   or you're missing a limb.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.460]   And that gets me to some really exciting
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.000]   and important studies that were performed
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.180]   mostly in the '90s as well as in the 2000s.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.340]   And that for now there is really a solid base of data.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.980]   There's really a center of mass
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.300]   around a particular set of experiments
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.660]   that point to particular protocols
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.900]   for how to overcome motor injury.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.700]   And this may resonate with some of you
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.340]   who've ever been injured to the point
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.600]   where you couldn't walk well temporarily, I hope,
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.700]   or even longer.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.220]   So think about a sprained ankle scenario
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.020]   or a broken arm scenario.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.240]   We're all familiar with the stories
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.180]   of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.860]   and that the particular limb that wasn't being used
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.140]   that was casted is much smaller and atrophied.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.380]   Most of that atrophy you might be surprised to learn
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.980]   is not because the muscles aren't being used,
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.020]   it's because the nerves sending signals to those muscles
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.460]   are not active and therefore the muscles aren't contracting.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.860]   Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.160]   and his graduate students and postdocs,
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.300]   Teresa Jones and others in the '90s and 2000s
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.180]   showed something really wonderful
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.100]   that I think we can all benefit from
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.420]   should we have an injury.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.420]   And even if we simply want to balance out imbalances
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.880]   in our motor activity.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.340]   And I think all of us tend to be stronger on one side
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.180]   or the other side.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.620]   Usually a right-handed person will be stronger
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.620]   in their left arm, not always for compensatory reasons.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.260]   Some other time we can talk about handwriting.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.400]   The lefties likely will be stronger in their right arm,
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.380]   although it kind of depends
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.300]   on whether or not people are hook righties.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.220]   That's when you kind of hook around and right from the top
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.540]   or hook lefties.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.840]   There are all sorts of theories about this
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.900]   that we can talk about right brain, left brain,
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.780]   math proficiency, et cetera.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.420]   In any event, what Schallert and colleagues showed
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.940]   was that if we have damage to our brain
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.540]   in the sensory motor pathways,
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.380]   any number of different sensory motor pathways,
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.980]   or we have damage to a limb,
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.420]   could be a leg, could be an arm, could be a hand,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.840]   there's great benefit to restricting the use
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   of the opposite better performing uninjured limb
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.880]   or hand or other part of the body.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.420]   They had about a dozen papers showing
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   that if there was damage centrally in the brain
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.100]   or there was damage to a limb,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.220]   so unilateral damage, as we say, one side,
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   the thing to do is not to cast up the damaged side,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.820]   although you need to do that to protect the limb,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.100]   of course, from further damage.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.940]   So if it's a broken arm, you need to cast the arm
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.560]   or you need to brace the arm,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.580]   but that the key thing was to restrict movement
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.920]   of the intact uninjured opposite limb.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.940]   And when they did that,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.240]   it forced some movement in the injured limb.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.300]   And remarkably, through connections
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.400]   from the two sides of the brain,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.780]   through the corpus callosum, this huge fiber pathway
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.700]   that links the two sides of the brain,
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.060]   they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.460]   So this makes sense when you hear it.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.620]   Let's say I injure my left ankle
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.940]   and I'm limping along or I'm using crutches.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.380]   You would think, well, the last thing you want to do
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.140]   is injure your opposite limb or not use your opposite limb.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.980]   My right ankle is perfectly fine.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.080]   But if I lean too hard on my right limb
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.860]   and I take all the work out of the left limb,
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.180]   the left ankle, that's actually setting up a situation
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.240]   where there's going to be runaway asymmetry
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.100]   in the central pathways and the nerve to muscle pathways
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.360]   on my left side.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.460]   And so what they suggested and what they showed
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.560]   in a variety of experiments was that by encouraging activity
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.500]   of the injured limb, provided it could be done without pain,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.420]   and importantly, not just exercising that limb
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.020]   or part of the body, but restricting the opposite healthy
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.180]   part of the body, that the speed of recovery
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.120]   was significantly faster.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   Now, I want to repeat.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.020]   You don't want to go injuring something further.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.140]   That's probably the worst thing you could do.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.260]   But in some cases where people have damage in their brain,
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.660]   the limbs are perfectly fine,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.900]   but the motor signals aren't getting down to the limbs.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.380]   And in that case, the limb is fine.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.900]   So you actually are free to use either limb
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.780]   as much as you want.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.700]   And in that case, you don't want to rely
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.400]   on the uninjured pathway too much.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.200]   In fact, you want to restrict the uninjured pathway.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.420]   So I find these studies remarkable.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.460]   And they've been followed up on at the molecular level,
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.540]   at the cellular level, many times.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.440]   And I think the physiotherapists out there
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.120]   and the rest of you who are involved in sports medicine
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.400]   and some of the physicians will say,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.100]   "Well, of course, that makes perfect sense."
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.920]   But oftentimes this is not what happens.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.440]   Oftentimes what happens is it's all about resting
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.460]   and limiting inflammation, et cetera, of the injured limb
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.820]   or the limbs corresponding to the injured part of the brain.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.560]   And these experiments and the collection of them
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.760]   point to the fact that the balance between the right
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.320]   and left side of our body is always dynamic.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.100]   It's always being updated at the level of neural circuitry.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.940]   The Ramachandran studies with the mirror box
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.020]   support that too.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.480]   And that even slight imbalances
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.980]   in the two sides of the body can get amplified.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.700]   And so when you're in a situation where one side is injured
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.240]   or the brain is injured representing one side of the body,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.140]   the key thing to do is to really overwork the side
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.820]   that needs the work and to restrict the activity
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.880]   of the side that doesn't need the work because it's healthy.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.400]   And this has great semblance to ocular dominance plasticity,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.360]   which I talked about a couple episodes ago.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.760]   I won't go into it in detail,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   but where the Nobel prize-winning neurobiologists,
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.240]   Torrance Wiesel and David Hubel showed
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.440]   that if one eye is closed early in development,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.040]   that the representation of the opposite eye in the brain
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.300]   is completely overtaken by the intact eye.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.640]   So this is important.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.500]   It means that all of our senses and our movements
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.340]   are competing for space in our brain.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.640]   And so the way to think about the principle
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.700]   is anytime you're injured and you're hobbling along,
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.700]   you don't want to injure yourself further,
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.460]   but you want to try and compensate
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.800]   in the ways that respect this competition
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.220]   for neural real estate.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.660]   And what that usually means is not relying
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.780]   on where you're still strong
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.260]   because that's just going to create runaway plasticity
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.880]   that's going to make it very hard for you
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.100]   to recover the motor function.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.620]   And in some cases, the sensory function of the damaged limb.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.300]   Some of you may be wondering how long
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.840]   and how often one should restrict the activity
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   of the intact or healthy limb or limbs in some cases.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.120]   And the answer is you don't have to do that
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.220]   all day every day.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.840]   These experiments centered on doing one or two hours
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.080]   of dedicated work, sensory motor work,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.120]   or so for instance, if you had a sprained ankle on the left,
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.220]   you might spend part of the day where your left leg,
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.040]   provided it's not too painful, can be exercised,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.820]   again, in a way that's not damaging to the injury,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.700]   and the right limb can't contribute to that exercise.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.180]   So this might be pedaling unilaterally on a stationary bike.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.140]   If you can do that for a different type of limb injury,
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.540]   like an arm injury, this might be reaching,
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.980]   provided the shoulder is mobile, doing reaching.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.860]   It might be even writing with the damaged side,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.920]   and then intentionally not writing
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.500]   with the preferred or undamaged side.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.580]   This has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.300]   and the recovery of function,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.400]   which I think is what most people want.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.180]   When people are injured, they want to get back
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.980]   to doing what they were doing previously,
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.660]   and they want to be able to do that without pain.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.740]   Now, this brings up another topic,
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.400]   which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.820]   but is a more general one that I hear about a lot,
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.260]   which is traumatic brain injury.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.780]   Many injuries are not just about the limb
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.840]   and the lack of use of the limb,
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.900]   but concussion and head injury.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.300]   And I want to emphasize, I'm not a neurologist.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.380]   I have many colleagues that are.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.740]   At some point, we will do a whole month on TBI
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.500]   because it's such a serious issue,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.320]   and it's such a huge discussion.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.340]   But I want to talk a little bit about what is known
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.060]   about recovery from concussion.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.820]   And this is very important because it has implications
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.500]   for just normal aging as well,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.180]   and offset setting some of the cognitive decline
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.520]   and physical decline that occurs with normal aging.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.580]   So we shouldn't think of TBI as just
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.420]   for the football players,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.040]   or just for the kids that had an injury,
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.740]   or just for the person that was in the car accident.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.300]   We want to learn about TBI and understand TBI
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.180]   for those folks, but we're also going to talk about TBI
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.460]   as it relates to general degradation of brain function,
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.980]   because there's a certain semblance there
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.860]   of TBI to general brain aging.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.060]   Typically after TBI,
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.560]   there are a number of different things that happen,
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.020]   and there are a huge range of things that can create TBI.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.980]   Neurologists and the emergency room physicians
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.080]   are going to want to know,
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.900]   was the skull itself injured,
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.160]   or did the brain rattle around in the skull?
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.260]   Was there actually a breach through the skull?
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.560]   Is there a physical object in there?
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.240]   How many concussions has the person had?
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.300]   I mean, everyone's situation with TBI
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.700]   is incredibly different,
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   but there's a constellation of symptoms that many people,
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.100]   if not all people with TBI report,
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.100]   which is headache, photophobia,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.900]   that lights become kind of aversive,
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.280]   sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.700]   sometimes mood issues.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.940]   There's a huge range,
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.580]   and of course the severity will vary, et cetera.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.100]   In a previous episode, I mentioned the Kennard Principle.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.900]   The Kennard Principle, named after the famous neurologist,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.600]   named by and after the famous neurologist, Margaret Kennard,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.100]   said that if you're going to get a brain injury,
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.180]   better to get it early in life than later in life,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.060]   and that's because the brain has a much greater
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.580]   or heightened capacity for repairing itself
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.300]   early in life than later.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.280]   But of course, none of us want TBI,
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.220]   and you can't pick when you get your TBI.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.020]   You can avoid certain activities that would give you TBI,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.180]   but really when it comes to TBI,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.060]   there are a couple of things
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.020]   that are agreed upon across the board.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.980]   The first one is as much as possible,
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.020]   you want to avoid a second traumatic brain injury
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.020]   or concussion.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.700]   Now that's going to be a tough one for some of the athletes
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.440]   and even recreational athletes to swallow
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.260]   because they want to continue in their sport,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.740]   and I'm not here to tell you that you should or you shouldn't
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.280]   but that's simply the way that it is.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.900]   For folks that are in military
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.420]   or that are in certain professions,
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.300]   construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.620]   It's not always just football.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.040]   A lot of construction workers are dealing
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.840]   with heavy objects swinging around in space.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.480]   They wear those hard hat helmets,
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.340]   which unfortunately don't protect much
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.980]   against a lot of those blunt forces
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.500]   and certainly not against falls and things of that sort.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.340]   So many people, in order to survive and feed their families,
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.540]   have to go back to work.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.140]   It's very clear that regardless of whether or not
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.260]   there was a skull break,
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.500]   and regardless of when the TBI happened
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.740]   or how many times it's happened,
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.500]   that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain,
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   is mainly centered around this lymphatic system
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.000]   that we call for the brain the glymphatic system.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.900]   Now, the brain wasn't thought to have a lymphatic system.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.260]   It wasn't thought to have circulating immune cells,
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.820]   but about 10 years ago, it was sort of rediscovered
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.880]   because if you look in the literature,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.700]   you realize this stuff was around longer,
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.980]   that there's a glymphatic system.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.660]   It's sort of like a sewer system
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.780]   that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.340]   especially injured neurons,
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.460]   and the glymphatic system is very active during sleep.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.900]   It's been imaged
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.900]   in functional and magnetic resonance imaging,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.580]   and the glymphatic system is something
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.960]   that you want very active
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.760]   because it's going to clear away the debris
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.900]   that sits between the neurons,
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.980]   and the cells that surround the connections
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.440]   between the neurons, called the glia,
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.260]   those cells are actively involved
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.140]   in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.880]   So the glymphatic system is so important
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.800]   that many people, if not all people who get TBI,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.740]   are told get adequate rest, you need to sleep,
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.100]   and that's kind of twofold advice.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.180]   On the one hand, it's telling you to get sleep
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.260]   because all these good things happen in sleep.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.140]   It's also about getting those people
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.860]   to not continue to engage in their activity full-time
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.660]   or really try and hammer through it.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.000]   You might say, well, if you have trouble sleeping,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.080]   how are you supposed to get deep sleep?
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.100]   Most of the activity of the glymphatic system,
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.580]   this washout of the debris,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.080]   is occurring during slow-wave sleep.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   Slow-wave sleep, as I mentioned in a previous episode,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.200]   is something that happens typically
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.240]   in the early part of the evening.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.080]   So even for those of you that are falling,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.480]   or early part of the night, rather,
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.300]   if you're falling asleep
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.920]   and then waking up three, four hours later,
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.720]   it's important that you continue to get sleep,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.800]   but know that the slow-wave sleep is mainly packed
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.600]   toward the early part of the night.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.220]   So that hopefully will alleviate some of the anxiety
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.060]   of the three and 4 a.m. wake up,
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.620]   although you really should follow some of the protocols
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.620]   that I've suggested in your physician's protocols
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.200]   in order to try and get regular,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.320]   longer sleep of seven, eight hours.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.000]   Later, we're going to talk about the eight-hour mark
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.900]   as a prerequisite for repair.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.880]   The glymphatic system has been shown
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.480]   to be activated further in two ways.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.920]   One is that sleeping on one side,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.560]   not on back or stomach,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.480]   seems to increase the amount of washout,
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.860]   or wash through, I should say, of the glymphatic system.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.200]   There aren't a ton of data on this,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.060]   but the data that exist are pretty solid.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.160]   Again, sleeping on one side,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.380]   or with feet slightly elevated as well,
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.520]   has been shown to increase the rate of clearance
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.800]   of some of the debris,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.240]   and that's because the way that the glymphatic system works
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.560]   is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.920]   that allow it to work more efficiently
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.460]   when one is sleeping on their side,
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.100]   or with feet slightly elevated.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.760]   So this means not falling asleep in a chair
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.100]   while watching TV.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.600]   This means, if possible, not falling asleep on one's back
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.180]   or on one's stomach, sleeping on one's side.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.320]   And if you can't do that,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.000]   like I don't really like to sleep on my side,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.480]   I sleep with my feet slightly elevated,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.560]   I put a kind of thin pillow under my ankles.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.400]   I don't have TBI,
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.560]   but I have had a few concussions before,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.480]   but right now I feel fine,
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.200]   but I find that putting the pillow under my ankles
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.000]   helps me sleep much more deeply,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.760]   and I wake up feeling much more refreshed.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.600]   The other thing that has been shown to improve the function
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.020]   of the glymphatic system,
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.840]   and this is, again, is for sake of TBI,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.440]   as well as for everyone, even without brain injury,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.840]   is a certain form of exercise.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.760]   And I want to be very, very clear here.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.440]   I will never, and I am not suggesting
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.400]   or that goes against their physician's advice.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.000]   Take your physician's advice
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.920]   as to whether or not you should be exercising at all
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.240]   and how much and into what intensity.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.280]   However, there's some interesting data,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.520]   and we can provide a link to the review on this,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.180]   which shows that exercise of what,
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.080]   I guess people would nowadays call it zone two cardio,
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.540]   which is kind of low level cardio
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.900]   that one could do while talking to somebody else.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.400]   You could maintain a conversation,
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.280]   although you don't have to talk to somebody else.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.980]   It just gives you a sense of the intensity of the exercise.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.240]   That zone two cardio for 30 to 45 minutes,
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.920]   three times a week,
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.480]   seems to improve the rates of clearance
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.360]   of some of the debris after injury,
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.640]   and in general, injury or no,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.760]   to accelerate and improve the rates of flow
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.120]   for the glymphatic system.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.540]   I find this really interesting
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   because I think nowadays there's such an obsession
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.720]   with like high intensity interval training
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.140]   and people trying to pack in as much as they can
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.360]   into a short workout,
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.520]   which is great if it brings people to the table
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.420]   who haven't been exercising before,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.360]   but I think it's really important
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.160]   that we know that the data on exercise
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.200]   and its relationship to brain health
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.540]   speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.920]   of this kind of what we call low level cardio.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.600]   It could be fast walking.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.920]   It could be jogging.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.040]   If you can do that with your injury safely,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.640]   it could be cycling.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.440]   This is not the kind of workout
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.640]   that's designed to get your heart rate up
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.880]   to the point where you're improving your fitness levels
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.280]   at some sort of massive rate
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.040]   or taking huge jumps in your VO2 max or anything like that.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.120]   This is exercise.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.040]   I do this and I know a number of other people,
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.700]   especially people in communities where there is a lot of TBI
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.000]   are now starting to adopt this,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.400]   that the 30 to 45 minutes, three times a week or so,
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.720]   could be more, of this zone two type cardio
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.800]   can be very beneficial for washout of debris from the brain.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.360]   And this is really interesting outside of TBI
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.760]   because what we know from aging
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.400]   is that aging is a non-linear process.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.240]   It's not like with every year of life,
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.840]   your brain gets a little older.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.680]   It has sometimes it follows
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.200]   what's more like a step function.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.720]   You get these big jumps in markers of aging.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.440]   I guess that we could think of them as jumps down
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.040]   because it's a negative thing for most everybody
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.800]   would like to live longer and be healthier
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.720]   in brain and body.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.280]   And so the types of exercise I'm referring to now
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.080]   are really more about brain longevity
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.340]   and about keeping the brain healthy
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.200]   than they are about physical fitness.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.640]   There's no reason why you couldn't do this
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.160]   and also provided again, it's safe for you
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.840]   given your brain state and injury state, et cetera.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.820]   There's no reason why you couldn't also combine it
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.220]   with weight training and other forms of cardio.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.620]   So I think this is really interesting.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.740]   And if some of you would like to know the mechanism
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.280]   or at least the hypothesized mechanism,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.880]   there's a molecule called aquaporin-4.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.120]   It almost sounds like the fourth in a sequel of movies
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.960]   or something like that.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   But aquaporin-4 is a molecule that is related
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.580]   to the glial system.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.700]   So glia or the, it means glue in Latin
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.340]   are these cells in the brain,
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.320]   the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact,
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.080]   that in sheath synapses, but they're very dynamic cells.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.760]   They're like little ambulance cells.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.360]   The microglia will run in and will gather up debris
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.480]   and soak it up and then run out after an injury.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.720]   Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed by the glial cell
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.880]   called the astrocyte.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.000]   Astro looks like a little star.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.720]   Incredibly interesting cells.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.040]   And the thing to remember is that the astrocytes
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.720]   bridge the connection between the neurons,
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.980]   the synapse, the connections between them
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.320]   and the vasculature, the blood system
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.080]   and the glymphatic system.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.480]   So they kind of sit at the interface
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.940]   and they're going to imagine somebody on an emergency site,
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.260]   car crash site, who's directing everybody around
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.100]   as to what to do.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.880]   Get that person on a stretcher, bandage them up,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   call their mother, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.200]   get this out of the road, put down some flares.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.440]   The astrocytes kind of work in that capacity
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.860]   as well as doing some things more directly.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.860]   So this glymphatic system and the glial astrocyte system
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.800]   is the system that we want chronically active
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.900]   throughout the day as much as possible.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.020]   So low level walking, zone two cardio,
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.320]   and then at night during slow wave sleep
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.240]   is then really when this glymphatic system kicks in.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.740]   So that should hopefully be an actionable takeaway
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.400]   provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.660]   that I believe everybody should be doing
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.240]   who cares about brain longevity,
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.700]   not just people who are trying to get over TBI.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.440]   Now I'd like to return a little bit
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.680]   to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.140]   because I think it's so interesting and so actionable
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.800]   that everyone should know about this.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   And in this case, we can also say
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.200]   that regardless of whether or not you're experiencing pain,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.960]   acute or chronic, what I'm about to tell you
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.840]   is as close as anything is to proof,
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.600]   in science we rarely talk about proof,
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.880]   we talk about evidence in favor or against a hypothesis,
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.560]   but as close as possible to proof
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.080]   that our interpretation, our subjective interpretation
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.720]   of a sensory event is immensely powerful
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.300]   for dictating our experience of the event.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.680]   Here are a couple of examples.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.360]   First of all, anyone who's ever done combat sports
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.920]   or martial arts knows that it's incredible
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.800]   how little a punch hurts during a fight
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.120]   and it's incredible how much it hurts after a fight.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.880]   The molecule adrenaline, when it's liberated into our body,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.980]   truly blunts our experience of pain.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:28.140]   We all know the stories of people walking miles
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.200]   on stumped legs, people doing all sorts of things
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.540]   that were incredible feats that allowed them to move through
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.040]   what would otherwise be pain,
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.680]   and afterward they do experience extreme pain.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.600]   But during the event, oftentimes
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.280]   they are not experiencing pain.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.900]   And that's because of the pain-blunting effects
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.000]   of adrenaline.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.540]   I'll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.400]   when we talk about acupuncture.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.920]   But norepinephrine binding to particular receptors,
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.840]   adrenaline binding to particular receptors
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.480]   actually shuts down pain pathways.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   People who anticipate an injection of morphine
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.420]   immediately report the feeling of loss of pain.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.940]   Their pain starts to diminish
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.000]   because they know they're going to get pain relief.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.280]   And it's a powerful effect.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.440]   Now, all of you are probably saying placebo effect.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.240]   Placebo effects are very real.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.280]   Placebo effects and belief effects, as they're called,
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.680]   have a profound effect on our experience
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.520]   of noxious stimuli like pain.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.160]   And they can also have a profound effect
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.020]   on positive stimuli and things that we're looking forward to.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.880]   One study that I think is particularly interesting here
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.800]   is from my colleague at Stanford, Sean Mackey.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.560]   They did a neuroimaging study.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.000]   They subjected people to pain.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.240]   In this case, it was a heat pain.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.800]   People have very specific thresholds to heat
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.780]   at which they cannot tolerate any more heat.
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.800]   But they explored the extent to which looking at an image
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.300]   of somebody, in this case, a romantic partner
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.820]   that the person loved would allow them
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.160]   to adjust their pain response.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.100]   And it turns out it does.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   If people are looking at an image
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.500]   or thinking about a person that they love,
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.420]   or even a thing that they love, a pet that they love,
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.600]   studies previous to the one that Mackey and colleagues did
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.980]   showed that their experience of pain was reduced.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.060]   Their threshold for pain was higher.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.380]   They could tolerate more pain.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.520]   And they reported it as not as painful.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.260]   But there's a twist there, which is it turns out
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.260]   that the extent to which love will modulate pain
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.700]   has everything to do with how infatuated
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.520]   and obsessed somebody is with the object of their love.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.260]   People that report thinking about somebody or a pet
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.540]   for many hours of the day,
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.380]   kind of having an obsessive nature,
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.340]   like almost like kind of what people might call
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.860]   quote unquote codependency.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.820]   For those of you that are listening,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.100]   I'm just providing air quotes
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.220]   'cause codependency is kind of a clinical thing now,
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.460]   although it's thrown around a lot all the time.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.540]   It's sort of like gaslighting.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.040]   People talk about gaslighting all the time.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.860]   Now, gaslighting is a real thing,
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.540]   but then people talk about gaslighting
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.880]   for many things outside the clinical description.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.340]   If people are very obsessed with somebody,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.380]   they have a kind of obsessive love of somebody's face,
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.940]   even if the other person doesn't know them,
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.540]   which is a little weird, that response,
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.580]   that feeling of love internally
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:34.180]   can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.140]   These are not small effects.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.820]   So it's not just that love can protect us from pain.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.140]   It's that infatuation and obsession
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.520]   can protect us from pain.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.940]   And not surprisingly, how early a relationship is,
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.280]   how new a relationship is directly correlates
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.480]   with people's ability, they showed,
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.840]   to use this love, this internal representation of love,
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.160]   to blunt the pain response.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.300]   So for those of you that have been with your partners
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.080]   for many years and you love them very much
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.180]   and you're obsessed with them, terrific.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.440]   You have a pre-installed,
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.560]   well, I suppose it's not pre-installed.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.460]   You had to do the work 'cause relationships are work,
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:14.060]   but you've got a installed mechanism for blunting pain.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.400]   And again, these are not minor effects.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.420]   These are major effects.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.900]   And it's all going to be through that top-down modulation
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.580]   that we talked about, not unlike the mirror box experiments
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.220]   with phantom limb that relieve phantom pain
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.020]   or some other top-down modulation.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.280]   And the opposite example is the nail through the boot,
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.260]   which is a visual image that made the person
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.780]   think it was painful when in fact it was painful,
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.960]   even though there was no tissue damage.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.900]   It was all perceptual.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   So the pain system is really subject
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.580]   to these perceptual influences, which is remarkable
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.020]   because really when we think about
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.460]   the somatosensory system, it has this cognitive component.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.220]   It's got this peripheral component,
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.220]   but there's another component,
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.700]   which is the way in which our sensation,
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.380]   our somatosensory system is woven in
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.340]   with our autonomic nervous system.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.620]   And we're going to get to that next,
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.740]   but I want to just raise the idea
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.340]   that the reason that this kind of infatuation
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.560]   and obsessive love can blunt the pain response
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.140]   and increase one's threshold for pain may have to do,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.740]   I would say almost certainly has to do,
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.500]   but it hasn't been measured yet, with dopamine release.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.160]   Because dopamine is absolutely the molecule
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.580]   that's liberated in our brain and body
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.900]   when there's a new kind of obsession or infatuation.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:34.460]   It's very distinct from the kind of love chemicals,
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.100]   if you will.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.700]   I don't even like calling them love chemicals.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.620]   That just feels weird.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.400]   If this were text, I would delete that line.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.640]   But from the chemicals associated with warmth
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.560]   and connection, such as serotonin and oxytocin,
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.900]   which tend to be for more stable, long lasting relationships.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.620]   Dopamine is what dilates the pupils,
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.820]   which gets people really excited.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.440]   They can't stop thinking about somebody.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.580]   The text messages are even exciting.
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.880]   They write to them and they can't wait
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.360]   for the text message to come back.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   The dot, dot, dot on the screen.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.640]   The text message is excruciating.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.200]   They don't respond for two minutes
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.600]   and people are getting flipped out.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.320]   I'm not here to support that kind of whatever.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:16.240]   What I'm saying is that that obsessive type of love,
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.800]   which without question is going to be associated
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:22.440]   with the dopamine pathway, does seem to have a utility
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.400]   in the context of reducing the unpleasantness
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.560]   of physical pain and probably has a lot to do
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   with reducing the unpleasantness of a lot of life,
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.920]   like sitting in traffic, et cetera.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.920]   Because when we talk about pain,
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.280]   emotional pain and physical pain start
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.520]   to become one in the same.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.320]   They are so closely intertwined that the lines
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.700]   between them neurally become very blurry.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.800]   What do I mean by that?
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Well, if love and infatuation can reduce pain,
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.000]   presumably through the release of dopamine,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.400]   well then does dopamine release itself, blunt pain?
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.360]   Should we be chasing dopamine release
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.480]   as a way to treat chronic and acute pain?
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.760]   And that's exactly what we're going to talk about now.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.360]   Independent of love, we're going to talk
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.420]   about something quite different,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.540]   which is putting needles and electricity
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.020]   in different parts of the body, so-called acupuncture,
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.180]   something that for many people,
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:19.240]   it's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.560]   but now there are excellent laboratories exploring
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.080]   what's called electro-acupuncture and acupuncture.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.660]   These are big university centers.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:30.160]   In fact, my source for everything I'm about to tell you next
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.400]   is Professor Chu-Fu Ma at Harvard Medical School
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.320]   and his papers.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.580]   I stand behind the information
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.580]   that I'm going to provide today,
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.720]   but it's extracted largely from the Ma lab's papers,
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   which are very rigorous, variable isolating experiments
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.520]   to address just how does something like acupuncture work?
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.280]   And I think what you'll be interested in
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.860]   and surprised to learn is that it does work,
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.000]   but sometimes it can exacerbate pain
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.200]   and sometimes it can relieve pain.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.740]   And it all does that through very discrete pathways
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.000]   for which we can really say,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.460]   this neuron connects to that neuron,
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.440]   connects to the adrenals,
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.800]   and we can tie this all back to dopamine
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.360]   because in the end, it's the chemicals and neural circuits
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.380]   that are giving rise to these perceptions
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.980]   or these experiences, rather,
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.600]   of things that we call pain, love, et cetera.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.520]   In a previous podcast episode,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.220]   I mentioned my experience of visiting an acupuncturist
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.280]   and getting acupuncture.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:30.100]   The acupuncture itself didn't really do that much for me,
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.040]   but I wasn't there for any specific reason.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.660]   It was gifted to me by somebody
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.280]   and I wanted to try it.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.740]   I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.140]   In fact, I know a number of people
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.400]   that really derive tremendous benefit from acupuncture
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.640]   for pain and for gastrointestinal issues.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.360]   There are actually a lot of really good
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.880]   peer-reviewed studies supporting the use of acupuncture
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.160]   for, in particular, GI tract issues.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.660]   In recent years, there's been an emphasis
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.560]   on trying to understand the mechanism
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.160]   of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself,
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.220]   not to support acupuncture
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.080]   or to try to get everybody to do acupuncture,
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.740]   but as a way to try and understand
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.880]   how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.680]   who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.260]   or brain-body relationship in general.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.580]   And actually, the National Institutes of Health
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.280]   in the United States now has a entire subdivision,
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.640]   an institute within the National Institutes of Health,
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.160]   which is complementary health.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.820]   And that institute is interested in things like acupuncture
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:38.600]   and a variety of other practices
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.080]   that I think 10, 15 years ago,
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.040]   people probably thought were really alternative
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.360]   and maybe even counterculture, at least in the States.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.240]   And it's exciting.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.040]   I think people are starting to really take a look
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.320]   at what's going on under the hood
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.840]   for certain types of treatments that are very useful.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.520]   And I think it's very likely to lead
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.480]   to an expanded number of treatments
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.320]   for a number of different conditions.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.800]   What I want to talk about in terms of acupuncture
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.440]   is the incredible way in which acupuncture
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.920]   illuminates the crosstalk
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.640]   between the somatosensory system,
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.960]   our ability to feel stuff externally,
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.800]   exteroception, internally, interoception,
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.480]   and how that somatosensory system
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.400]   is wired in with and communicating
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.960]   with our autonomic nervous system
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.960]   After that, I'm going to talk about
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.600]   how the acupuncture that's being done right now
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.780]   also points to relief for what's called referred pain.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.320]   So this takes us all back to the homunculus.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.140]   Let's start there.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.640]   We have this representation of our body surface
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.860]   in our brain.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.960]   That representation is what we call somatotopic.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.360]   And what somatotopy is,
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.480]   is it just means that areas of your body
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.760]   that are near one another,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.220]   so your thumb and your forefinger for instance,
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.760]   are represented by neurons
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.000]   that are nearby each other in the brain.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.420]   Now you might say, well, duh,
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.960]   but actually it didn't have to be that way.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.080]   The neurons that represent the tip of my forefinger
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.640]   and the neurons that represent my thumb on the same hand
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.760]   could have been distantly located.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.400]   And therefore the map of my body surface,
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.840]   the homunculus would be really disordered,
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.660]   but it's not that way.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.860]   It's very ordered, it's very smooth.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.800]   As let's say you were to image my brain,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.920]   if you were to stimulate my finger, my forefinger,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.240]   and then march that stimulation across my finger,
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.620]   across the palm into the nearby thumb,
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.120]   you would see that neurons in the brain
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.880]   would also make a sort of J shape
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.920]   in their pattern of activation.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.880]   So that means they're so-called somatotopy,
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.500]   but the connections from those brain neurons
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.340]   are sent into the body and they are synchronized with,
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.720]   meaning they cross wire with and form synapses
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.760]   with some of the input from the viscera,
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.920]   from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach,
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.360]   from our spleen, from our heart.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.780]   Our internal organs are sending information
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:06.120]   up to this map in our brain of the body surface,
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.840]   but it's about internal information,
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.320]   what we call interoception,
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.760]   our ability to look inside or imagine inside
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.020]   and feel what we're feeling inside.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.020]   So the way to think about this accurately
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.640]   is that our representation of ourself
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.620]   is a representation of our internal workings,
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.260]   our viscera, our guts, everything inside our skin
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.360]   and the surface of our skin
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.120]   and the external world, what we're seeing.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.920]   Those three things are always being combined
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.100]   in a very interesting, complex, but very seamless way.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.500]   Acupuncture involves taking needles
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.680]   and sometimes electricity and/or heat as well
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.200]   and stimulating particular locations on the body.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.920]   And through these maps of stimulation
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.880]   that have been developed over thousands of years,
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.620]   mostly in Asia, but now this is a practice
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.380]   that's being done in many places throughout the world,
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.480]   they have these maps that speak to,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.420]   oh, well, if you stimulate this part of the body,
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.460]   you get this response.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.320]   And if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue,
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.880]   like their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea,
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.960]   you stimulate this area
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.840]   and it'll slow their gut motility down.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.500]   Or if their gut motility is too slow, they're constipated,
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.680]   you stimulate someplace else and it accelerates it.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.360]   And hearing about this stuff,
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.240]   it sounds kind of to a Westerner
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.280]   who's not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry,
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.720]   it could sound kind of wacky.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.160]   It really sounds like alternative
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.760]   or even kind of really out there kind of stuff.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.360]   But when you look at the neural circuitry, the neuroanatomy,
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.560]   it really starts to make sense.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.820]   And Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.760]   is an excellent laboratory,
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.880]   has been exploring how stimulation of different types,
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.680]   intense or weak, with heat or without heat
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.080]   on different parts of the body
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.640]   can modulate pain and inflammation.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.960]   And what they've shown in a particularly exciting study
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.080]   is that stimulation of the abdomen
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.000]   anywhere on the midsection, weakly, does nothing.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.200]   That's not very interesting, you might say.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.080]   Intense stimulation of the abdomen, however,
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.920]   with this electroacupuncture has a very strong effect
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.640]   of increasing inflammation in the body.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.780]   And this is important to understand
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.400]   because it's not just that stimulating the gut does this
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.100]   because you're activating the gut area,
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.920]   it activates a particular nerve pathway.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.520]   For the aficionados, it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.600]   if you really want to know.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.020]   And it's pro-inflammatory under most conditions.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.240]   However, there are other conditions where if, for instance,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.300]   the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.100]   that can be beneficial.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.020]   And this goes back to a much earlier discussion
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.520]   that we had on a previous podcast
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.380]   that we'll revisit again and again,
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.080]   which is that the stress response
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.000]   was designed to combat infection.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.160]   So it turns out that there are certain patterns
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.560]   of stimulation on the abdomen
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.040]   that can actually liberate immune cells
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.080]   from our immune organs, like our spleen,
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.880]   and counter infection
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.620]   through the release of things like adrenaline.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.120]   Chufu's lab also showed that stimulation
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.120]   of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.380]   And again, this was done mechanistically.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.260]   This was done by blocking certain pathways
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.380]   with the appropriate control experiments.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.980]   This was done not in any kind of subjective way.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.580]   This was also done by measuring particular molecules,
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.400]   IL-6 and cytokines and things that are related
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.080]   to the inflammation response.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.080]   And what they showed is that the stimulation
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   of in particular the hind limbs at low intensity
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:51.380]   led to increases in the activity of this vagal pathway,
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.340]   the vagus nerve being this 10th cranial nerve
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.260]   that serves the kind of rest and digest and parasympathetic,
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.180]   in other words, calming response.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.940]   So what this means is that we are now at the front edge
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.840]   of this research field that's just,
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.100]   it's early days still,
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.400]   but it's discovering that depending on whether or not
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.000]   the stimulation is intense or mild,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.260]   and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body,
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.680]   you can get very different effects.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.140]   So this points to the idea
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.020]   that you can't say acupuncture good or acupuncture bad.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.940]   There has to be a systematic understanding
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.300]   of what exactly the effect is that you're trying to achieve.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.820]   And the underlying basis for this is really relevant
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.500]   to the thing about adrenaline that I said before,
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.700]   that in a fight, it's rare that you ever feel pain
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.540]   when you get hit.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:38.460]   I've experienced that, but later it hurts a lot.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.960]   It turns out that when you stimulate these pathways
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.940]   that activate, in particular, the adrenals,
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.460]   the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.140]   and the brain does as well,
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.180]   it binds to what are called
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:52.540]   the beta-noreadrenergic receptors.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.500]   Okay, so this is really getting kind of down into the weeds,
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.980]   but the beta-noreadrenergic receptors activate the spleen,
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.160]   which liberates cells that combat infection,
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.920]   and it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.660]   That's the short-term quick response.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:11.620]   The more intense stimulation of the abdomen and other areas
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.900]   can be pro-inflammatory because of the ways
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.400]   that they trigger certain loops that go back to the brain
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.500]   and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.420]   and that place people into a state of anxiety
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.180]   that exacerbates pain.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.300]   So one pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts pain.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.740]   The other one doesn't.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.780]   What does all this mean?
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.820]   How are we supposed to put all of this together?
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.140]   Well, there's a paper that was published
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.980]   in "Nature Medicine" in 2014.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.900]   This is an excellent journal
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.460]   that describes how dopamine
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.260]   can activate the vagus peripherally,
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.300]   not dopamine in the brain, peripherally,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.260]   and norepinephrine can activate the vagus peripherally
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.800]   and reduce inflammation.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.460]   And I'm not trying to throw a ton of facts at you,
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.300]   say, "Well, what am I supposed to do
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.260]   "with all this information?"
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.340]   What this means is that there are real maps
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.760]   of our body surface that, when stimulated,
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.140]   communicate with our autonomic nervous system,
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.820]   the system that controls alertness or calmness,
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.580]   and thereby releases either molecules
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.980]   like norepinephrine and dopamine,
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.980]   which make us more alert as we would be in a fight,
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.460]   and blunt our response to pain.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.340]   And they reduce inflammation.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.660]   But there are yet other pathways that, when stimulated,
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.180]   are pro-inflammatory.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.480]   And that brings us to the question of,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.300]   what is all this inflammation stuff
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.200]   that people are talking about?
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.660]   One of the things that bothers me so much these days,
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.140]   and I'm not easily irritated,
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.420]   but what really bothers me is when people
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.600]   are talking about inflammation, like inflammation is bad.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.880]   Inflammation is terrific.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.820]   Inflammation is the reason why cells
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.180]   are called to the site of injury to clear it out.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.160]   Inflammation is what's going to allow you
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.900]   to heal from any injury.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.060]   Chronic inflammation is bad.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.960]   But acute inflammation is absolutely essential.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.900]   Remember those kids that we talked about earlier
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.820]   that have mutations in these receptors for sensing pain,
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.160]   they never get inflammation.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.240]   And that's why their joints literally disintegrate.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.220]   It's really horrible,
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.780]   because they don't actually have the inflammation response,
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.840]   because it was never triggered by the pain response.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.320]   So inflammation can be very beneficial.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   There's a lot of interest nowadays in taking things
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.960]   and doing things to limit inflammation.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.940]   One of the ones that comes up a lot is turmeric.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.320]   I'm sure the moment anyone starts talking about inflammation,
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.600]   the question is, what about turmeric?
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.800]   I have talked before about turmeric elsewhere.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.660]   I am very skeptical of turmeric.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.480]   And I might lose a few friends,
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.220]   although that'd be weird if my friend,
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.560]   that would say something about my friendships
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.340]   if I lost friends over a discussion about turmeric.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.960]   But in any case,
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.280]   turmeric does have anti-inflammatory properties.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.480]   There's no question about that.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.000]   But as we've just described,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.520]   inflammation can be a very good thing,
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.800]   at least in the short term.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.000]   The other thing about turmeric
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.540]   is there was a study published out of Stanford
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.560]   in collection with some work from other universities
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.880]   showing that a lot of turmeric
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.300]   is heavily contaminated with lead.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.920]   The lead is used to get that really rich, dense,
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.240]   orange coloring to it that everyone wants to see.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.020]   So you have to check your sources of turmeric.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.660]   The other thing is for men in particular,
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.800]   turmeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrotestosterone.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.600]   Dihydrotestosterone is the more dominant form of androgen
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.800]   in human males.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.340]   And it's involved in things like aggression
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.340]   and libido and things of that sort.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:32.160]   Many people that I've talked to who have taken turmeric
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.600]   get a severe blunting of affect and libido.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.060]   So for some people, that might be a serious negative.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.720]   I certainly avoid turmeric.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.320]   I don't like turmeric for that reason.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.080]   I also think that the inflammation response
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.720]   is a healthy response.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.680]   You have to keep it in check,
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.400]   and we're going to talk about specific practices
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.740]   for wound, healing, and injury in a moment.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.920]   But this idea that just inflammation is bad
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.720]   and you want to reduce inflammation across the board,
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.320]   nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.880]   We have pathways that exist in our body
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.920]   specifically to increase inflammation.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.820]   It's the inflammation that goes unchecked,
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.640]   just like stress, which is problematic
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.380]   for repair from brain injury,
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.580]   and that can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et cetera.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.720]   But I'd like to create a little bit more nuance
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.280]   or a lot more nuance if possible
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.740]   in the conversation around inflammation,
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.540]   because people have just taken this discussion
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.140]   around inflammation to be this idea
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.840]   that just inflammation is bad
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.440]   and nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.540]   Before I continue, I just thought I'd answer a question
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.020]   that I get a lot, which is what about Wim Hof breathing?
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.100]   I get asked about this a lot.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.640]   Wim Hof, also called, AKA the Iceman,
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.580]   has this breathing that's similar to Tummo breathing,
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.700]   as it was originally called,
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.460]   involves basically hyperventilating
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.620]   and then doing some exhales and some breath holds.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.660]   A couple of things about that,
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   it should never be done near water.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.780]   People who have done it near water,
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.180]   unfortunately, have drowned.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.620]   It's certainly not for everybody,
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.420]   and I'm not here to either promote it
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.520]   nor discourage people from doing it.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.780]   But I think we should ask ourselves,
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.180]   what is the net effect of that?
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.300]   Because a number of people have asked me about it
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.860]   in relation to pain management.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.100]   The effect of doing that kind of breathing,
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.380]   it's not a mysterious effect,
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:17.220]   it liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.820]   There is a paper published in the "Prosthenes
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.240]   of the National Academy of Sciences,"
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.620]   which is a very fine journal,
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.480]   showing that that breathing pattern
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.460]   can counter infection from endotoxin.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.420]   And that's because when you have adrenaline in your system,
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.060]   and when the spleen is very active,
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.940]   that response is used to counter infection,
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.800]   and stress counters infection.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.420]   We'll talk about this more going forward,
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.700]   but the idea that stress lends itself to infection is false.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.340]   Stress counters infection
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.200]   by liberating killer cells in the body.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.900]   You don't want the stress response to stay on indefinitely,
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.520]   however.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.280]   Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.300]   anything that releases adrenaline will counter the infection.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.440]   But you want to regulate the duration
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.200]   of that adrenaline response.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.160]   This should make perfect sense.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.680]   We, as a species,
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.760]   had to evolve under conditions of famine and cold.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.080]   Actually, Texas right now is an extreme case
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.540]   of cold and power outages.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.400]   I've seen the pictures
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.080]   and there are a lot of people out there really suffering.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.680]   Their systems are releasing a ton of adrenaline.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.740]   They're cold.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.800]   Some of them are likely to be hungry.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.360]   They're probably stressed.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.920]   They're releasing a lot of adrenaline,
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.380]   which is keeping them safe from infection.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.880]   After they get their heat back on and they relax
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.480]   and they can finally warm up again,
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.400]   which we would like for them very soon.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.880]   Hopefully by the time this podcast comes out,
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.500]   that will have already happened.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.480]   That's typically when people get sick
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.520]   because the immune response is blunted
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.980]   as the stress response starts to subside.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:51.420]   So stress, inflammation, countering infection
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.680]   that comes from endotoxin,
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.920]   that comes from any number of things can be from cold.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.200]   It can be from hyperventilation.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.040]   It can be from a physical threat.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.680]   It can be from the stress of an exam or an upcoming surgery.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.380]   This adrenaline thing and the inflammation associated
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.160]   with it is adaptive.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.740]   It's highly adaptive.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:11.580]   It is a short-term plasticity that is designed
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.120]   to make us better for what we're experiencing
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.840]   and challenged with, not worse.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.100]   And so hopefully that will add an additional layer
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.120]   to this whole idea that stress is bad,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.280]   inflammation is bad, et cetera.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.780]   Again, I'm not suggesting people do or don't do something
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.520]   like Wim Hof Tummo breathing.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.800]   I just want to point to the utility.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.080]   It's very similar to the utility from cold showers,
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.600]   ice baths, and other forms of anything
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.480]   that increase adrenaline.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.040]   Every episode, I want to make sure
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.640]   that every listener comes away
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.020]   with as much knowledge as possible,
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.340]   but also actionable tools.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.360]   And today we've talked about a variety of tools,
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.120]   but I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.260]   that hopefully you won't need,
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:55.560]   but presumably if you're a human being and you're active,
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.100]   you will need at some point.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.100]   It's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast,
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.320]   or at least as fast as possible.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.340]   It includes removing the pain.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.000]   It includes getting mobility back
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.360]   and getting back to a normal life,
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.140]   whatever that means for you.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.340]   I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about next
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.960]   was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett,
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.160]   who many of you probably have heard of before.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.920]   Kelly can be found at The Ready State.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.360]   He's a formally trained,
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.780]   so degreed and educated exercise physiologist.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.000]   He's a world expert in movement and tissue rehabilitation,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:34.960]   et cetera.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.760]   They're not sponsors of the podcast.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.480]   Kelly is a friend and a colleague.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.240]   He's somebody that I personally trust,
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.120]   and his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury,
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.920]   I think are really grounded extremely well
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.280]   in both medicine, physiology,
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.460]   and the real cutting edge of what's new
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.600]   and what you might not get in terms of advice
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.120]   from the typical person.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.680]   All that said, you always, always, always should consult
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.440]   with your physician before adopting any protocols
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.640]   or removing any protocols.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.600]   So I asked Kelly, I made it really simple.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.660]   I said, okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.080]   or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.720]   or something like that, or shoulder injury.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.440]   What are the absolute necessary things to do
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.880]   regardless of situation?
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.020]   And what science is this grounded in?
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.580]   And then I made it a point to go find the studies
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.040]   that either supported or refuted what he was telling me
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.480]   because that's why I'm here.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.400]   So the first one is a very basic one
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.660]   that now you have a lot of information to act on,
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.920]   which is in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.380]   both brain and body, we know that sleep is essential.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.820]   And so we both agreed that eight hours minimum
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.280]   in bed per night is critical.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.760]   Now, what was interesting, however,
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.940]   is that it doesn't have to be eight hours of sleep.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:58.200]   We acknowledge that some of that time
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.940]   might be challenging to get to sleep,
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.040]   especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.240]   We forget how often we roll over in bed
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.020]   or how the conditions of our sleeping
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.060]   can impact those injuries too.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.720]   So Kelly acknowledged and I agree
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.000]   that eight hours of sleep would be ideal,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.160]   but if not, at least eight hours immobile.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.300]   And that speaks to the power
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.500]   of these non-sleep deep rest protocols too.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.320]   If you can't sleep doing non-sleep deep rest protocols,
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.880]   we've provided links to them before.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.240]   We're going to continue to provide links
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.480]   to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.760]   That is extremely beneficial.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.320]   So that's a non-negotiable in terms of getting
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.380]   the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.000]   and tissue clearance, et cetera.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.800]   The other is, if possible,
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.460]   unless it's absolutely excruciating
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.920]   or you just can't do it, a 10 minute walk per day,
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.000]   of course, you don't want to exacerbate the injury,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.840]   at least a 10 minute walk per day and probably longer.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.040]   This is where it gets interesting.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.600]   I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself,
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.920]   you're supposed to ice something,
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.000]   you're supposed to put ice on it.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.200]   But I didn't realize this,
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.940]   but when speaking to exercise physiologists
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.200]   and some physicians, they said that the ice
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.960]   is really more of a placebo.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.080]   It numbs the environment of the injury,
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.100]   which is not surprising,
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.980]   and will eliminate the pain for a short while.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.340]   But it has some negative effects
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.080]   that perhaps offset its use.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.400]   One, it sludges, it creates sludging within the blood
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.800]   and other lymphatic tissue.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.400]   So it actually can create some like clotting and sludging
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   of the tissue and fluids, the fascial interface with muscle.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.100]   And a number of the stuff that's supposed to be flowing
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.960]   through there can slow up and increase inflammation
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.480]   in the wrong way, can actually restrict movement
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.720]   out of the injury site, which is bad
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   because you want the macrophages
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.500]   and the other cell types, phagocytosing,
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.000]   eating up the debris and injury
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.280]   and moving it out of there so that it can repair.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.520]   So that was surprising to me,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.680]   which made me ask, well, then what about heat?
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.040]   Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.840]   A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.700]   and all these genetic pathways and protein pathways
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.200]   that can be activated by heat.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:13.020]   Very little data to support the idea
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.040]   that heat shock proteins are part
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.800]   of the wound healing process,
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.880]   at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.360]   that one could use like a hot water bottle
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.520]   or a hot bath or a hot compress.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.640]   The major effects seem to be explained
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.240]   by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:35.380]   and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid,
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.840]   blood, lymph and other fluids out of the injury area.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.680]   So that's really interesting.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.520]   I didn't know this.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.980]   I thought, well, you're supposed to ice something.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.360]   I said, well, whenever I would like see a kid get injured
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.320]   in soccer, never me, of course, no, of course,
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.840]   I got injured in soccer from time to time,
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.880]   they give you an ice pack.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.300]   And the ice pack removes some of the pain.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.500]   I think the consensus now, which was surprising to me,
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.260]   is that the ice pack is actually more
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.780]   of the top-down modulation.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:01.420]   You think you're doing something for the pain.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.780]   There's some interesting studies
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.000]   that actually showed the placebo effect of the ice pack.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.540]   So ice packs are placebo, perhaps.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.380]   That's interesting.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.080]   I'll underline perhaps because who knows,
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.240]   maybe there's some people out there
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.700]   that are going to say this is totally crazy
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.640]   and the ice is actually very beneficial.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   But it seems like heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.860]   And it turns out that the movement itself
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.900]   can act as a bit of an analgesic.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.720]   It can actually reduce the pain.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.760]   Whereas the ice reduces the pain, but sludges the tissue
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.400]   and keeps the cells that need to be removed
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.560]   from leaving the area.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.840]   Now, what's also interesting is in neuroscience,
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.520]   we know that if we want to kill neurons or silence neurons,
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.880]   we cool them.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.500]   This is a well-known tool in the laboratory.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.380]   Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:52.140]   that form the basis for the textbooks,
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.740]   we're lowering a cooling probe
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.040]   into a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.700]   in order to shut down that nerve.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.040]   So the cooling will shut down the nerve.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.760]   But another very well-known fact in neuroscience textbooks
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.300]   is that when the activity of the nerve pathway
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.860]   or neurons comes back,
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.140]   there's what's called homeostatic plasticity,
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.460]   that it rebounds with greater pain,
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.940]   with a higher level of intensity,
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.100]   which in the pain system would equate to greater pain.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.660]   So regardless of where these neurons are in the body,
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.020]   if you stimulate a neuron, it's active.
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.000]   If you cool it, it becomes inactive.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.060]   And when the neuron heats back up after being cooled,
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.940]   it becomes hyperactive.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.380]   And so this makes really good sense as to why heat,
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.520]   provided it's not damaging levels of heat,
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.500]   would be more beneficial for wound healing
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.460]   and for reducing pain in the short and long run
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.900]   than would be cold or ice,
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.480]   which I find very interesting.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.220]   Now, in terms of chronic pain,
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:49.460]   the manuscripts on this,
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.220]   my discussion with Kelly and with others
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.740]   point to the fact that chronic pain
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:56.100]   is basically plasticity gone wrong.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.260]   It's sort of like PTSD for the emotional system
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.620]   and the stress system.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.900]   And chronic pain is going to involve
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.500]   a number of different protocols
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.340]   to rewire both the brain centers
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.620]   and the peripheral centers associated with chronic pain.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.820]   Certain things like fibromyalgia, for instance,
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.700]   which is whole body pain,
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.460]   relate to too little inhibition.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.460]   In the brain, you have excitation and inhibition.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.860]   They come from different sources of neurons.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.280]   The inhibition is mainly from GABA and glycine
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.480]   and things like that.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.620]   In fibromyalgia, there's too little central
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.740]   within the brain modulation of the pain responses
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.060]   so that people experience whole body pain.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.120]   So in that case,
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.060]   the emerging therapies are really interesting.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.220]   I have a friend who works
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.420]   for the National Institutes of Health
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.100]   who unfortunately suffers from fibromyalgia
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.300]   who asked me about this a lot.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.860]   And his question and what he's now actually exploring
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.260]   is red light therapy,
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.380]   something that I've talked about on various Instagram posts.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.060]   Red light therapy typically is talked about
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.960]   in terms of mitochondria.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.540]   And the data on that are not so terrific,
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.340]   at least not really published in blue ribbon journals
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.920]   in most cases, except for one study that I'm aware of
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.540]   from Glenn Jeffrey's lab at University College London
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.060]   showing that red light stimulation
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.520]   to the eyes in people 40 or older
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.820]   can offset some of the effects of macular degeneration
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.580]   by improving the health of the photoreceptors.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.800]   People with fibromyalgia, which is this whole body pain,
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.940]   are now starting to use red light therapies.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:26.780]   And I asked Kelly and others and some experts in pain,
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.500]   what are your thoughts on this red light therapy
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.180]   for things like fibromyalgia and pain,
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.940]   especially red light local therapy?
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:38.480]   Their idea, and I don't think this is a field
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.820]   that's progressed far enough now
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.360]   to really place any firm conclusions on,
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.780]   but the idea is that red light therapy locally
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:49.300]   may have some effect, but the systemic red light therapy,
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.820]   this is like wearing protection to the eyes in some cases,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.100]   so not from the treatment of macular degeneration,
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.420]   but wearing protection to the eyes
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.500]   and getting very bright red light therapy,
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.460]   in many ways may be, to use Kelly's words,
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:04.320]   approximating the effects of nature.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.060]   These are like surrogate technologies
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.780]   for getting outside in the sunshine.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:09.420]   When you're in the sun, it might not look red,
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.060]   but there are a lot of red wavelengths coming toward you.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.880]   So the red light therapies may have some utility,
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.800]   but getting into sunlight
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.960]   may actually have as much or more effect.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.840]   Of course, if these wounds are on a part of the body
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.280]   that you can't expose,
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.280]   then you could imagine why the red light therapy
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.120]   might be good.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.640]   I don't know, depending on the neighborhood you live in,
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.440]   that may or may not be a weird thing to go outside
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.100]   and expose your body to sunlight.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.760]   Probably a number of factors that dictate
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.920]   whether or not that'd be weird or not,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.640]   but that's up to you, not me.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.640]   And it seems that, so movement, heat, not ice,
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.280]   light, sleep, and in some cases, the use,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.940]   and I'll talk about this in a moment,
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.480]   some cases, the use of restricting above and below the injury
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.540]   to then release and then increase profusion
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:55.380]   through the site.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:59.560]   So may actually accelerate the wound healing.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.980]   So all of this might sound just like common sense knowledge,
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.680]   but to me, at least as a 45-year-old,
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.140]   I always just thought it's ice,
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.680]   it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.800]   it's things that block prostaglandins,
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.300]   so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.440]   those things generally work by blocking things
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.440]   like the, they're called cox prostaglandin blockers
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.120]   and things of that sort, things in that pathway.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.420]   Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.860]   may not be so great at the beginning
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.340]   when you want inflammation.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.440]   They may be important for limiting pain
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.380]   so people can be functional at all.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.660]   But the things that I talked about today
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.160]   really are anchored in three principles.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.940]   One is that the inflammation response is a good one.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.820]   This is what we're learning
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:48.800]   from Chufu Ma's lab's work on acupuncture.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.120]   The immediate acute inflammation response is good.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.900]   It calls to the site of injury,
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.700]   things that are going to clean up the injury in bad cells.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.860]   Then there are going to be things
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.460]   that are going to improve profusion
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.740]   like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.040]   feet elevated, sleeping on one side,
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.060]   low level zone two cardio three times a week.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.180]   Red light perhaps is going to be useful
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:15.380]   though sunlight might be just as good
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.820]   depending on who you talk to.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.420]   And we talk about that probably more at length
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.620]   in a future episode.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.580]   A number of people will ask me I'm sure about stem cells
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:27.500]   and I don't want to take more of your time
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.900]   by going into an hour long discussion about stem cells.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.820]   Stem cells exist in all of us during development.
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   We were created from stem cells
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.420]   which are cells that can become essentially anything.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.160]   Later cells get what's called restricted in their lineage.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.240]   So a skin cell,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.200]   unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it,
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.860]   you can't actually turn that cell into a neuron.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.060]   Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.100]   for finding these Yamanaka factors
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.060]   which you could give a skin cell to turn into a neuron
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.540]   but that's not an approved therapy at this time.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:59.220]   But many people ask me about platelet rich plasma,
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.860]   so-called PRP.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:04.140]   They take blood, they enrich for platelets
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.340]   and then they re-inject it back into people.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.180]   Here's the deal.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.720]   This deserves an entire episode.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.500]   It has never been shown whether or not the injection itself
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.140]   is what's actually creating the effect.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.920]   This is something that the acupuncture literature
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.420]   suffered from for a long time,
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.040]   that the sham control as it's called,
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.340]   sham, we don't mean it's a sham,
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.980]   but in science you say a sham control,
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:28.740]   meaning you do everything exactly the same way you would.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.140]   So for acupuncture,
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.380]   you would bring the needle right up to the skin
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.420]   but you wouldn't actually poke it into the skin,
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.960]   for instance, that would be a sham control.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.900]   With a drug treatment,
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.860]   you would inject a drug into a person
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.980]   and then the control, the sham control would be
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.580]   that you would bring the injection over,
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.780]   you might do the injection or not do the injection
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:49.340]   'cause you imagine that the injection itself
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.540]   could have an effect.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.620]   It's never really been shown whether or not PRP
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:53.900]   has effects that are separate
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.980]   from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.020]   The claims that PRP actually contains stem cells
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.940]   are very, very feeble.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.220]   And when you look at the literature
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:08.300]   and you talk to any one expert in the stem cell field,
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.500]   they will tell you that the number of stem cells in PRP
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.220]   is infinitesimally small.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:18.680]   In fact, so much so that these places that inject PRP
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.580]   for injuries are not allowed to advertise
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.440]   through the use of the words stem cells.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.980]   It's actually illegal at this point.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.100]   At least as far as I know,
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.260]   it was through the end of last year
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.580]   and I'm guessing it still is now.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.940]   Stem cells are an exciting area of technology.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.940]   However, there was a clinic down in Florida
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.820]   that was shut down a couple of years ago
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:41.300]   for injecting stem cells harvested from patients
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.100]   into the eye for macular degeneration.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.460]   These were people that were suffering from poor vision
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.400]   and very shortly after injecting these stem cells
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.860]   into the eyes, they went completely blind.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.240]   So I'm somebody who is very skeptical
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.740]   of the stem cell treatment work that's out there.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.820]   It's actually very hard to get in the United States
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.640]   for this reason.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.840]   It's not approved.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.320]   The PRP treatments are very complicated.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.320]   The marketing around them is shaky at best.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.060]   I'm sure a number of people will say that they had PRP
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.700]   and benefited from it tremendously.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.060]   And I don't doubt that.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.340]   Whether or not it was placebo,
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.260]   today we talked a lot about top-down control.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.220]   That's just a variant on the word placebo, belief effects.
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.940]   Whether or not it was placebo or not, I don't know.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.680]   I wasn't there.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.740]   That's for you to decide.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.000]   And I'm not here to tell you
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.320]   that you should or shouldn't do something,
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.800]   but I do think that anything involving stem cells,
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.340]   one should be very cautious of.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.780]   You should also be very cautious of anyone
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:41.000]   that tells you that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.480]   This is an evolving area
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.420]   that really needs a lot more work and attention.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.160]   The major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.200]   is that stem cells are cells
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.240]   that want to become lots of different things,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.020]   not just the tissue that you're interested in.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:56.980]   So if you damage your knee
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:00.060]   and you inject stem cells into your knee,
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.700]   you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:05.580]   so that they don't become tumor cells, right?
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.520]   A tumor is a collection of stem cells, right?
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.260]   So when you get something horrible
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.900]   like glioblastoma in the brain,
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.240]   which is a terrible thing to have,
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.080]   it's glial cells that returned to stemness,
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.100]   excessive stemness.
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.580]   They've started to produce too many of themselves.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:25.000]   And glioblastoma is often deadly, not always.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.420]   So injecting stem cells, it sounds great,
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.960]   and it sounds like something that one would want to do,
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.120]   but one needs to approach this with extreme caution,
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.560]   even if it's your own blood or stem cells
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.440]   that you're re-injecting.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.400]   I think those technologies are coming.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.440]   They're on the way.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:44.920]   If any of you are devotees of PRP,
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.480]   tell me your experiences with them.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.320]   I'm curious.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.200]   I want to see the papers.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   I want to know the evidence.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.320]   And of course, there are always folks out there that say,
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:52.820]   "I don't care what the scientists
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.520]   and the physicians and the FDA say.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.800]   I just want to do this."
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.660]   And if that's your stance, that's your stance.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.340]   I'm not here to govern that.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.480]   But I do think that people should be informed.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.680]   And in thinking about tissue recovery and injury,
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.280]   that's what I was able to glean.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.220]   Again, check out what Kelly and his coworkers are doing
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:13.060]   at the ReadyState.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:13.940]   It's phenomenal.
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.080]   And they've worked with all the top people
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.640]   in just about every domain of life, it seems.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.120]   Very high integrity folks.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.580]   Some of you are probably saying,
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:23.520]   "Well, I'm not injured.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.340]   I'm not an athlete.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.600]   I don't want stem cell injections.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.640]   I don't have..."
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.640]   Again, I think you shouldn't get stem cell injections
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.580]   for now.
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.620]   Please hold off until the field learns more
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.180]   about how to do that safely.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:38.080]   But I want to talk about and end with a really interesting
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:43.080]   and somewhat weird technology, which is baby blood.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.520]   I have a colleague at Stanford.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.760]   His name is Tony Weiss-Cory.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.300]   And in 2014, his laboratory published a study
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:55.300]   showing that the blood of young rodents, mice and rats,
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   when transfused into old demented rodents, mice and rats,
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:05.960]   made those old demented rodents recover much of their memory
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:10.960]   and seem much more vital and energetic,
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.160]   better recall of different spatial learning tasks,
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.360]   tissue and wound healing, they've since shown
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.080]   can be improved in these older animals.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   It's pretty incredible.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.360]   They went on to show several years later
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:31.360]   that blood from umbilical cords, I'm not making this up,
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:35.280]   blood from umbilical cords can do the same.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.760]   And this is the basis of a biotech company.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.440]   Actually, one of my former post-docs
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.800]   is now an employee there.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:46.200]   They've isolated the molecules from young blood
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:51.200]   that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.160]   and body, and one of those molecules
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.940]   goes by the name Timp2, T-I-M-P, two.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.840]   Where's all this going?
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.980]   Well, I don't know how long it's going to be
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:04.080]   before there are treatments
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.900]   based on these blood transfusions.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:11.400]   I doubt that blood transfusions themselves
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.720]   from young people into old people
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.720]   is going to be used for the treatment of dementia,
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.320]   although it might.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:21.680]   As weird as it seems, we know that transfusions
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.240]   of all sorts of stuff, for instance,
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.740]   fecal transplants are being used to treat obesity.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:30.280]   The gut microbiome of thin people is being,
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.000]   not transfused, but is being transplanted
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.100]   into the colons and guts of obese people
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.400]   and leading to weight loss, which sounds really wild
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.580]   and is not a topic I particularly enjoy talking about.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.760]   But nonetheless, it points to the importance
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.120]   of the gut microbiome in regulating things like blood sugar
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.680]   and health as it relates to obesity and diabetes
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.760]   and all sorts of things.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.120]   So it does appear that there are things, factors,
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.840]   in the blood of young members of a given species
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   that are lost over time in the older members of that species.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.280]   I am not going to give you a tool
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.160]   on the basis of these findings today.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.720]   I am not going to tell you to consume any fluid
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.420]   from any other member of your species, our species,
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.520]   for any reason.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.680]   But I do think that it's important to mention
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.960]   that the science is asking questions such as
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.600]   what are the factors within the brain
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.860]   that allow the young brain to recover so much better
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.000]   than the older brain from injury,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.920]   from all sorts of things, events, et cetera?
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.740]   And what are the factors in the older brain
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.160]   that are limiting?
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:49.040]   And thinking about identifying which factors
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.560]   are going to allow people to restore cognitive function,
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.320]   physical function, wound healing, and so forth.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.720]   It's a really exciting area.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.160]   I mention it not to be sensationalist,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.220]   but because it's happening
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:05.660]   and because there's a lot of excitement about it.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.800]   And because I think it's clear that the young brain
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.860]   and body and blood are very different
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:16.240]   from the old brain, body, and blood.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.880]   And the goal of science is to identify
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.920]   and isolate those factors that make that so
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:27.040]   such that people who would otherwise get dementia
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.880]   or perhaps even have dementia will be allowed to recover.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.340]   Again, not an actionable item at this point,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.960]   but one to think about,
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.960]   perhaps not too long, but one to think about.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.200]   So I'm going to close there.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.980]   I've talked about a lot of tools today.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:48.100]   I've talked a lot about somatosensation,
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.740]   about plasticity, about pain, about acupuncture,
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.800]   some of the nuance of acupuncture, inflammation, stress.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.200]   We even talked a little bit about high-intensity breathing.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.700]   Talked about restricting limb movement
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:05.560]   to get compensatory regrowth of pathways,
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.040]   or I should say reactivation of pathways
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.700]   that have been injured or damaged.
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.800]   So as always, we take kind of a whirlwind tour
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.160]   through a given topic, lay down some tools as we go.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:22.380]   Hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury,
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:24.900]   but also neuroplasticity in general today
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.880]   in the context of the somatosensory system
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.260]   will be of use to all of you.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.020]   I don't wish injury on any of you,
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.580]   but I do hope that you'll take this information to mind
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.780]   and that you will think about it
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.300]   if ever you find yourself in a situation
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.620]   where you have to ask,
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.800]   what's the difference between my perception
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.020]   and the actual tissue damage?
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.340]   Is it injury and pain?
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.180]   Is it the same?
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.020]   Well, no.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.660]   Do I have some control over my experience of pain?
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:49.880]   Absolutely.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.780]   Does all of that involve taking drugs
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:53.100]   or doing certain therapeutics?
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.180]   No, not necessarily.
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:56.900]   There's an incredible subjective component.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.940]   There also is a need sometimes to treat the injury
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:05.180]   at the level of the pain receptors at the site of the wound.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.900]   So please take the information,
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.400]   do with it what you will.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.020]   And in the meantime,
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.360]   thank you so much for your time and attention.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.420]   Before we go, I just want to remind you
