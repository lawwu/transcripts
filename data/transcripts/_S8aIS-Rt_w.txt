[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Two of your major themes, Pastor John,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   are God's sovereignty and the centrality of joy in God
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.840]   in the Christian life.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.480]   How do these two topics relate?
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.560]   How is Calvinism connected to joy in God?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.600]   - I love that question, Tony, I really do.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   I mean, these are two of the most precious
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.960]   and glorious things in my life.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.480]   I could talk about these all day long,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   which created a problem when I went to answer this with you.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   (laughs)
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.080]   I think I'm gonna need to break this into two,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.320]   if I'm not mistaken.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.400]   So you decide whether you wanna make this two or not,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.240]   but there's two ways to answer this.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.440]   One is foundational about the very nature of God himself
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080]   and how his godness, his free and independent sovereignty
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.360]   relates to our joy.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.280]   That's the first one that I'll answer.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.560]   And the second one that may need a second APJ
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.560]   is how God's sovereignty in this fallen world
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.600]   actually helps us fight for our joy
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.200]   in the face of enormous suffering and sorrow.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.840]   So let me tackle the first one
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.200]   and then we'll see how long it takes
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   and we can go for a second if you want to.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.200]   Here's how they relate.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   God's sovereignty is owing to his completeness as God.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.960]   He has no needs.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280]   He depends on no one and nothing.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   All that he needs, he has in and of himself,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   and therefore he is infinitely happy
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.200]   in the fellowship of the Trinity.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560]   So the love that the father has for the son
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.240]   and the son has for the father,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   this love is essentially joy
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.560]   because they're not lovingly enduring each other.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.440]   Like there's no long suffering in the Trinity
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   like there is for sinners outside the Trinity.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   They have an infinite pleasure in each other's perfections.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.760]   And therefore joy, and this is what just blows my mind
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   and I love it,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   therefore joy is at the essence of God's godness.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.300]   It is the foundation of his sovereignty.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.920]   The reason God is free and independent
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.560]   and powerful outside God
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.600]   is that he is completely happy inside God.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.480]   He has no needs and he's sovereignly independent
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.240]   because he's happy at the core of his being
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.920]   in his all sufficiency, his self-sufficiency.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.120]   And therefore when he creates the world,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480]   it's not owing to any deficiency in him.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.800]   He didn't create out of need.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.080]   He didn't create because he hoped
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.880]   that his creation would supply something
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.540]   that he was lacking.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.280]   It was motivated by giving, not needing.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.820]   And therefore, and this is the greatest news
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.820]   in all the world, is that therefore he spills over
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.600]   with his own joy in God.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.440]   God's creating the world is God's intention
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.680]   to share with creatures in his own image
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.400]   the very joy that he has in himself.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   That's what he wanted to share.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   So when you read in John 17, the prayer of Jesus,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.200]   what he desires for us at the end of that prayer
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.400]   is that we would be with him where he is
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   to see his glory that God had given him
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.440]   and that we would love him with the very love
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   that the Father has for the Son,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.900]   which is I think what the indwelling
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.200]   of the Holy Spirit is really all about.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   loving the Son and the Son loving the Father.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.740]   And oh for the day, Tony, oh for the day
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.480]   when we'll be done with sinning
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080]   and the joy that we have in God will be the kind of joy
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.160]   that he really designed for us to have.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.780]   And therefore, our joy is not marginal
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.720]   to the reason for the universe.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.920]   This is what's so mind-boggling when people say,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.400]   oh I think joy is just icing on the cake of Christianity
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.880]   and really it's all about commitment and obedience
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.760]   and if joy comes, that's nice,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   and if it doesn't, that's okay.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.320]   That's just crazy.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's right at the heart of what the universe,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.560]   who God is and who we are.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.560]   So we were created to share in God's joy, in God,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.660]   and he made us to do this,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.020]   and here's the last piece of this big answer.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.160]   He made us to do this in such a way
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.780]   that when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.900]   he is most glorified in us.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.780]   So you can see why I'm a Christian hedonist,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.540]   why I've spent all my adult life trying to think through
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.540]   the meaning of joy in a world like this.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.280]   When we are thrilled, when we are most satisfied
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   in all the perfections of God,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   we show those perfections to be precious to us,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.840]   to be our treasure.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   We highlight them and lift them up and magnify them,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.420]   and that's why the universe was made.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.900]   So if you ask me, Tony, what's the relationship
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.600]   in the big picture between the sovereignty of God and joy,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   I would say in God, joy is the ground,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.720]   ground of his sovereignty and the overflow
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.840]   of his sovereignty.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.880]   Because he is perfectly happy, he is independent and free
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.400]   and needs nothing and sovereignly works on behalf of others,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.120]   and when he does that, what he's working for
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.560]   is our joy in him, and so there's this great circle
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.700]   of enjoying God and glorifying God.
