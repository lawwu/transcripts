[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.340]   My name is Joshua, I am your host,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.000]   and today on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.600]   I want to share with you how you can live income tax-free
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.440]   in these United States.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.520]   Now, a couple of caveats as we begin.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   I'm going to be talking in today's show
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.220]   about the United States,
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.560]   how you can live in the United States
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.080]   and live income tax-free.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.020]   Obviously, there are many ways to live income tax-free
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.860]   in many places around the world.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.660]   You could move to the Cayman Islands
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.140]   and make millions of dollars as a banker,
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.460]   as a finance guy, or as an online business guy,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.300]   and pay $0 of income tax,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.800]   as long as you're not a US American citizen.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.880]   You could, of course, do all kinds of things
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.100]   in other countries.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.580]   Every country, if you go through and study their tax code,
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.320]   usually winds up with some strange little loophole,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.340]   some strange little thing that makes that country
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.580]   attractive.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.560]   In Canada, you can actually earn a significant amount
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160]   of money in the form of dividends
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.620]   from Canadian corporations
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.260]   and pay $0 of income taxes on that.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.520]   In the United Kingdom,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   you can generate your income as a professional gambler
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.260]   and not pay any income on that.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.100]   So if you're a professional poker player,
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.480]   it behooves you to be living in the United Kingdom,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.700]   rather than, as long as you're not a US citizen, of course,
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.680]   the caveat we always have to give,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.320]   rather than in other places.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.280]   Today, I'm going to talk about the United States,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.220]   and I'm gonna tell you how you can live income tax-free
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.680]   in the United States.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.820]   Some of this will apply to other countries,
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.500]   because many countries have some form
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.180]   of this particular planning idea that I'm gonna focus on,
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.100]   but it definitely works in the United States,
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.580]   so you'll wanna consider that.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.340]   There are a number of obvious,
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.020]   but low-hanging tax savings ideas
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.620]   that I'm not gonna cover today.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.000]   For example, in the previous episode in this podcast,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.900]   I talked about how if you simply work under the table
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.360]   and you don't report your income,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.100]   yes, you can pay no taxes, but I don't recommend it.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.900]   And I explained that, number one,
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.060]   I don't recommend it because it winds up
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300]   causing you a significant, potentially,
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900]   amount of legal risk, but perhaps more importantly,
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.460]   it just keeps you at the lower echelons of society.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.500]   You're never gonna build a big business
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.180]   that you're proud of, that you can put your name on,
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180]   that you can really build something
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.660]   if you're worried about the taxman.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, you'll do some little fly-by-night business,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   working out of the back of your truck,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   and you might make tens of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   Conceivably, could you make six figures?
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.660]   I think absolutely you could,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.640]   but you're gonna be worried about spending it, right?
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.540]   You're not gonna put pictures
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.520]   of your nice vacations on Facebook
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.080]   because you're worried about the taxman
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.480]   using that as evidence against you
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.580]   of how much money you're spending.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.200]   It's just, it's no way to live, in my opinion.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.000]   But what if you genuinely want to build something big,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.380]   live in the United States,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.560]   and live completely income tax-free?
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.340]   Well, if we go to those basic requirements,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.700]   we have a very, very small number of planning ideas
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.100]   that we can choose from.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.980]   And there is basically one big planning idea that works,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.540]   but that also has a huge problem.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.180]   But here's the big planning idea.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.820]   It's called debt.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.500]   Here's the key thing about the US Income Tax Code.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.440]   When you borrow money, that is not income.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.660]   And so if you borrow money,
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.660]   and then spend that borrowed money,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.860]   you can spend money without generating taxable income.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.860]   You say, "Okay, Joshua, that's obvious,
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.580]   but what's the planning idea?"
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.180]   Well, I think there are more planning ideas here
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.300]   than people often recognize.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.660]   You know, years ago, I remember I didn't have very much money
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.640]   and I was investing heavily in my business.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.900]   I was using credit cards,
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.700]   borrowing money for personal expenses and business expenses,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.980]   putting them on credit cards.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.660]   And I wound up at the end of the year
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.540]   with a big fat tax refund, no tax bill, big fat tax refund,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.020]   because I hadn't made any money.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.700]   I had just borrowed money.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.340]   And yet I had gotten my way through the whole year
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.780]   and I had lived.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.460]   I had spent money, I had paid my bills,
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.020]   and I hadn't paid any income taxes
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.420]   because I hadn't created or received any income.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.980]   I had simply borrowed money.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.820]   So this is the key,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.660]   and we're gonna explore some aspects of this.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.620]   Now, credit cards have a rather limited shelf span,
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.620]   shelf life.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.980]   All right, you can borrow money on credit cards
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.460]   for actually a significant amount of time.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.220]   As you know, I sell a course on it,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.700]   available at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store,
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.840]   how to borrow money safely
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   and never pay interest using credit cards.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.300]   And basically in that course,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.040]   among other important topics,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.860]   I teach you how to play the 0% credit card game.
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.820]   In a country like the United States of America,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.740]   where credit flows easily,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.680]   almost anybody can get their hands on credit cards.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.060]   You can get good credit offers
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.020]   and you can borrow vast sums of money
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.260]   and you can regularly roll those sums of money over
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.660]   and providing yourself with spendable money, right?
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.020]   Most places they'll take a swipe,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.700]   a credit card that you can swipe,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.160]   but you haven't created income.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.940]   But usually in almost any circumstance that I can think of,
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.160]   you do reach an end to your ability to borrow.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.140]   You can't just roll over credit cards indefinitely
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.340]   and not have any income.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.560]   After all, when you sign up for a new credit card,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.100]   you have to declare your income.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.980]   And you can only kind of play the game of,
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.300]   well, I just had a job making $200,000,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.140]   so I'll declare that.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.180]   You can only play that game for a little while
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.820]   before at some point in time,
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.020]   the credit card company comes along and says,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.100]   yeah, you're not such a great risk.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.220]   Now, clearly, if you've got some way
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.740]   to pay off those credit cards, that doesn't depend on you.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.380]   For example, you might receive annual gifts
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.260]   from a family member.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.060]   Well, of course, annual gifts, as long as they fall below
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.620]   the annual exclusion amount, those are always tax-free.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.700]   And then if they are actually taxable
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.980]   at some point in time, income that's received as a gift
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.720]   is not taxable to you.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.100]   So if you have a wealthy parents
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.140]   and your wealthy parents want to gift you
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.780]   with a certain amount of money every year,
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.420]   they can gift you 30, 40, hundreds of thousands
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.940]   of dollars per year, and that won't be taxable income to you.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.800]   So that's one idea that can sometimes come into play.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.460]   You might have a spouse, right?
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.260]   A husband or a wife who is generating a lot of money.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.980]   Well, income that your husband or your wife receives
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.100]   is not yours, and there's no gift tax
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.620]   on money that's transferred among spouses.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.000]   So maybe you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.380]   you swipe your credit cards,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.140]   but your husband or your wife gives you money
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.460]   and you just use that money to pay off
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.300]   your credit card bill.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.480]   So obviously that would work,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.180]   but of course it's kind of cheating, right?
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.520]   It's not really delivering the good.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.740]   So how do you genuinely live income tax-free?
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.040]   Well, the answer is you need something that's growing,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.560]   that's going to allow you to pay off your debt
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.380]   before you start falling behind on payments.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.420]   And it's ideal if that thing is not taxable, right?
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.360]   So how do most people use credit cards?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.900]   Well, most people would swipe a credit card,
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.660]   they would go out and they would buy a bunch of stuff,
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.500]   and then they would plan that in the future
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.580]   they're going to make more money.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.720]   So in my case, when I was borrowing money
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.080]   to start a business, yeah, I wasn't making any money,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.360]   but I was planning to make money.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.460]   And then in the future, when I made money
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.380]   and then I paid off those credit cards,
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.580]   I couldn't deduct those credit card expenses
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.180]   because the business once had already been deducted.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.820]   But later I had the opportunity
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.460]   to pay a higher amount of income tax on my income
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.220]   to pay off those credit cards.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.840]   And so that plan ultimately breaks down.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.520]   But what if you could have something that could grow
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.320]   and could allow you to continue borrowing on it
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.260]   almost indefinitely?
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.440]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.480]   Wouldn't that solve the problem?
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.880]   The answer is yes, but it's really hard to find.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   Now let's talk about this for a moment.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   Let's use perhaps the most popular tool for this,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.960]   although perhaps not the only one,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.840]   but the most popular tool for this,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.660]   which is something like real estate.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.840]   Let's assume this.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.280]   You go out today and you buy a house
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.960]   that's marketed under value.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.840]   I'm gonna play fast and loose with my numbers
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.760]   to get the point across to you.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.440]   You buy a house, this house,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.620]   you pay $100,000 for this house.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.800]   Right, you had to have the $100,000 in some form.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   Maybe you can borrow it,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.680]   but maybe you just start with $100,000
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   that you've already paid tax on.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.480]   So you buy a house for $100,000.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.440]   But because of your skill in negotiating a superior deal,
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.140]   your house is actually worth $150,000.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.920]   So you buy it at $100,000,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   and on day one, you have $50,000 of gain in the property.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.840]   Well, then you go out and you get a mortgage on the property.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.440]   In our case, for simple math,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.200]   let's assume that you mortgage $150,000 on the property,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.280]   and you take and set aside the $150,000
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.440]   in your bank account.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.720]   Well, what you've just done in our silly little example
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.040]   is you have just created for yourself
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.640]   $150,000 of spending power
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.700]   that you don't owe any kind of income tax on.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.920]   You don't owe any kind of employment taxes,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.280]   no Medicare, no Social Security.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.340]   You also don't owe any kind of income taxes,
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.600]   no federal income taxes, no state income taxes.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.440]   Why? Because you borrowed money.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.480]   But what does a house often do for you?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.280]   A house often generates for you
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.400]   a certain amount of rental income.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.120]   And so you can take that rental income
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.560]   and you can pay down the mortgage,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.100]   or at least make the mortgage payments.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.400]   Now you say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Joshua.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.560]   Is that rental income not taxable income?"
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.200]   Answer is absolutely yes, it is.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.800]   It is taxable income.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.240]   But there are some assets for which taxable income
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.120]   is sheltered in some way.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   In real estate, it's called depreciation, right?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.580]   The idea is that your house becomes,
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.880]   the structures of your house become worth less
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   and less each year as they're used up.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   And so you get a certain amount of depreciation allowance
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.200]   where you can offset the income with those expenses.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.160]   Now, this can be something of a very interesting
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.960]   financial engineering game in some circumstances.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.020]   Because the reality is the land under your house,
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.000]   while your house itself is steadily being used up
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.920]   and is running out of value,
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.680]   thus your depreciation expense,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.760]   the land underneath your actual house
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.920]   might be increasing in value.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.140]   And it might be becoming more desirable.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.600]   And thus people might want your house,
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.060]   even though it's more used up than it was previously,
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.860]   they might want your house more than they did before.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.400]   And so your actual property is increasing in value.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.100]   Please note, it's not because the house
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.980]   is increasing in value.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.480]   The house is not decreasing in value.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.880]   The house is being worn out, it's being used up.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.060]   That's why you have a depreciation expense.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.820]   But what is happening is the attractiveness
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.960]   of your house is increasing in value.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.660]   And the land underneath your house is increasing in value.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.940]   And so someone might be willing to pay you more for it
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.180]   at some point in the future.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.980]   And so you can often shelter your income payments
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.640]   from tax by your depreciation expenses.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.160]   This really works best if you don't have a lot
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.260]   of other expenses associated with the house.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.540]   So in a perfect world here,
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.340]   if we were just designing our perfect
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.620]   how to live income tax-free world,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.260]   we would have a house and we would never pay
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.680]   any principal on the mortgage.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.640]   We would just pay interest payments.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.060]   That way the interest expense is a pure cost.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.140]   We don't need to generate additional income
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.340]   in order to pay down the mortgage
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.780]   'cause we don't wanna pay down the mortgage
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.280]   in this current example.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.860]   We just wanna keep the mortgage there
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.180]   and borrow the money and just pay the bare minimum.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.100]   And so thus we don't realize very much income
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.380]   to pay down the mortgage.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.100]   And then it's best if all the other expenses
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.420]   are controlled as well.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.160]   Now let's say that you buy the right kind of house
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.940]   in the right kind of neighborhood
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.340]   and then you own it for a few years, three years say,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.180]   and then you sell it.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.680]   And maybe now it's increased in value in the marketplace
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.460]   because people wanna move where you bought
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.060]   or they like the land underneath the house
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.540]   and they say the house will work for now.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.900]   And now somebody comes along and offers to pay you
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.620]   $250,000 for the house.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.460]   Well, in the US tax code,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.500]   there's something called a like-kind exchange
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.260]   where you can exchange certain capital gain property
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.740]   for other capital gain property
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.420]   without recognizing the embedded taxable gain
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.240]   in the property.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.980]   So you can swap out one rental house
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.580]   for another rental house.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.380]   And so you go and you do this called a 1031 exchange.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.360]   You do this exchange from one rental house
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.200]   to another rental house.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.040]   And now you have another rental house,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.280]   but now you go and you take the,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.260]   what number did I use?
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.480]   I guess $250,000, I guess was the number I said.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.060]   Somebody gave you $250,000 for the property.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.480]   So you take your $250,000,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.640]   you go out in the marketplace
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.440]   and you find a house that's actually worth $350,000,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.800]   but you get a good deal on it
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.040]   and you pay $250,000 for it.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   So now you repeat the process.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.200]   You take out, you buy the house
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.400]   with the money that you have.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   You do a like-kind exchange into the property
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.660]   so you don't recognize any taxable gain.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.640]   Then you mortgage that property.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.360]   You go ahead and put a $300,000 mortgage on it.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.080]   Now all of a sudden you've got another,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.720]   what do we have, two hundred and something thousand dollars
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.840]   of money in your pocket.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.380]   And you repeat this process again and again and again.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.440]   You buy a property, you buy capital gains property,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.460]   you allow that property to appreciate,
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.000]   you borrow against that property
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.760]   and you spend the borrowed money
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.480]   while allowing the income from the property
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.800]   to pay your necessary payments to your lender.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.700]   This is how you generate tax-free income.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.320]   It's not actually income, 'cause it's not income, it's debt.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.980]   But this is how you have spendable money
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.800]   on your bank account that's genuinely income tax-free.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.600]   Now you'll quickly see the restrictions
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.820]   and you'll quickly see the disadvantages of this.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.080]   So one obvious thing is you need capital gains asset.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.760]   You need something that's not creating income
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   necessarily, you just need a capital gains asset
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.640]   that's growing in value.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.520]   You also need something that's growing in value.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.880]   If you go and you buy a house
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.440]   and you mortgage $300,000 on it,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.240]   and all of a sudden now you can't sell it
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.840]   for more than $200,000, you got a major problem.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.480]   Because the lender comes knocking and says,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.840]   "Hey, we want some money."
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.760]   And you've got to go and generate that money
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.180]   in some other way, and that other way
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.200]   might not be as tax efficient as you had hoped.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.640]   But this is the basic process of living income tax-free
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.720]   in the United States.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.400]   The secret is borrow money.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.640]   Borrowed money is not income.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.920]   And if you can supplement that borrowed money,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.400]   if you can buttress or backstop that borrowed money
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.860]   with a high quality asset that's growing in value
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.360]   and not sell the asset, in theory,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.200]   you can actually live this way for your entire lifetime.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.400]   So let's say you had that real estate investor
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.160]   who purchased those houses,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.080]   it was constantly taking out new mortgages,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.160]   was spending the money from the mortgages,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.520]   that investor would have a very low taxable income.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.740]   Now, in reality, no investors don't keep it at zero,
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.840]   but they can often keep it at a very low amount
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.000]   of actual taxable income because of this process.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.200]   Well, if you continue to own those properties
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.480]   at the end of your life,
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.680]   remember that we're dealing with capital gains property,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   and so you could even leave that property to your heirs.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.760]   And then under current US estate tax law,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.740]   any capital gain property that you own
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.000]   at the date of your death receives what's called a step up
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.400]   in tax basis.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.560]   So if you own the property,
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.160]   and let's say your whole portfolio,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.400]   your basis in the property is a million dollars,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.360]   but it's worth $5 million,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.600]   and you've been spending the equity in the form of debt,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.820]   but allowing your tenants to pay that off for you,
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.480]   and your depreciation expense is sufficient
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.860]   so that you don't have a lot of taxable income.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.840]   Well, now at your death,
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.800]   you own $5 million of real estate,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.840]   you can leave that $5 million to your heirs,
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.900]   your heirs would inherit the money,
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.480]   with no income taxes due,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.560]   because there's no income taxes due on inherited property.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.680]   They would, in our example,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.000]   not owe estate taxes under current law.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.480]   And what's more important is the entire capital gains
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.380]   that you had embedded in the property
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.920]   would have been cleared out
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.640]   by the step up in tax basis at your date of death.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.160]   And so now your heirs can genuinely live tax free, right?
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.440]   They could take the $5 million,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.280]   they can go and sell it,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.100]   they can sell it all at once,
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.960]   they can sell it piecemeal,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.740]   and they can spend all that money
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.400]   completely income tax free,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.760]   or they can repeat the process, right?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.080]   They can keep your $5 million portfolio,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.440]   they can borrow against it,
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.240]   maybe they go out and they mortgage it for $3 million,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.000]   the property continues to appreciate in value,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.360]   they spend the mortgaged money for their living expenses,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.600]   and then they can repeat that year after year after year,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.400]   or decade after decade after decade.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.760]   Now, is this an unwieldy plan?
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.480]   It is, it really is.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.800]   Is it hard to do this purely?
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.920]   I've never known anyone
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.360]   who was able their entire lifetime
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.900]   to live completely income tax free in the United States.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.460]   But this is a valuable component
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.620]   that can fit into what you're doing.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.620]   And you can actually repeat this process a number of times.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.860]   Now, real estate's not the only thing that this works with,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.700]   but it does work very nicely with real estate, why?
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.060]   Well, there are a couple of other things
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.420]   that can come into play.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.700]   So with real estate,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.040]   you can often force the appreciation with your own labor.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.060]   So years, about three or four years ago,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.440]   I did a series of shows on real estate
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.600]   and how to get wealthy and pay no tax with real estate.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.800]   And in that, I gave the example.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.080]   Let's say that you're skilled, right?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.560]   You're a good carpenter, you enjoy working with your hands,
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.840]   you're good at fixing up houses.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.520]   So you go and you buy a handyman special house,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.200]   and you just simply buy it.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.760]   You spend your time forcing the appreciation
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.480]   by painting it, fixing the walls, fixing the house up, right?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.200]   You're now forcing appreciation of the property.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.640]   It's becoming more valuable,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.700]   not because it's just magically becoming more valuable.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.840]   No, it's becoming more valuable
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.640]   because of the work that you put into it.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   But because you're just investing your own time,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.640]   your own labor, your own work, and some of your own money,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.680]   you're not generating taxable income.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   Well, now you can go ahead and if you live in the property,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.600]   you can file that property as a personal residence.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.860]   And that personal residence is now eligible
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.840]   for the exclusion on capital gains
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.400]   from the sale of a personal residence.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.040]   Up to $250,000 of capital gain for an individual,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.960]   $500,000 for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.920]   With a few exceptions,
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.840]   basically you got to live there
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.740]   at least two of the last five years.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.020]   And there's no reason why you can't repeat this process.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.600]   So a real estate investor,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.640]   especially one who's willing to put work into the property,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.200]   can do this again and again and again.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.840]   They can buy a house, they can fix it up,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.740]   they can rent it out, then they can go on and repeat.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.240]   And anytime they want to go ahead
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.920]   and get some of that tax-free gain,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.940]   they kick out their renters, they move in themselves,
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.800]   then they live in it for two years,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.200]   then they sell the property,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.820]   and now all of a sudden there's genuine
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.760]   tax-free gain to them.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.040]   And so they can do this back and forth.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.640]   Now, I don't know that many really successful
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.160]   real estate investors who are willing to move that much.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.040]   I've never known anybody that was that committed
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.920]   to tax savings where they were willing
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.100]   to deal with the lifestyle costs.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.160]   Most of us at some point in time realize
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.600]   that tax savings are not the be-all, end-all,
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160]   that actually you just want to live a nice lifestyle.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.000]   And if you can save some tax, great.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.720]   Otherwise you'll pay the amount of tax
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.600]   that's necessary for your lifestyle.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.320]   But it is possible.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.080]   What other assets could do this?
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.360]   Well, other assets might include
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.560]   something like a family business, right?
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.940]   So if you had a family business
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.100]   that you had shares of stock that you could borrow against,
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.360]   now you could possibly just simply borrow
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   against those assets, pledge the stock as collateral,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.160]   and then spend the debt.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.500]   Doesn't have to be a family business though.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.200]   You can do this with publicly traded companies as well.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.160]   In fact, in many cases,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.240]   it's easier to do with publicly traded accounts
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.000]   because margin financing is more easily available
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.640]   than on something like a closely held corporation.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.120]   If you've got a big, giant stock portfolio
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.320]   and all of a sudden you need a bunch of money,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.240]   income tax-free, well, you can just simply borrow the money
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.260]   by pledging some of the stock portfolio as collateral.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.000]   This is not without risk.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.760]   What if your stocks go down in value
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.120]   and all of a sudden you wind up facing margin calls?
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.240]   Not without risk.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.760]   But it without question works
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.560]   and it allows you to spend money without selling assets.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.720]   So if you have a portfolio
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.440]   of just amazingly performing stocks
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   that are growing in value all over the place,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.840]   you can simply keep it and borrow against it.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.080]   You could do this with other assets.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.200]   You could do this with cryptocurrencies.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   If you have a big portfolio of Bitcoin
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.260]   and you find somebody who's willing to lend you money
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.320]   using the Bitcoin as collateral,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   then you will be able to spend that loaned money
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.800]   and not pay any income tax on the loan.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.520]   The downside with some of these assets
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.800]   has to do more with,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.180]   well, how do I actually service the debt?
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.480]   Where do I get the money from to service the debt?
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.920]   See, real estate, because it has often income
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   and because it has depreciation expense
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.520]   that can offset some of that income,
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.800]   real estate works well.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.480]   And it's hard to find another asset
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   that has that same profile,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.520]   where you have income that you can spend right now,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.880]   but that income is sheltered by a depreciation expense,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.080]   a depletion expense,
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.760]   if you're doing this with an oil and gas well
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.720]   or something like that.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.660]   And it's enough to allow,
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.400]   to give you time for the asset to grow.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.040]   But this is the basic concept.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.980]   To repeat, I've never known anybody
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.480]   who's lived their whole life totally tax-free
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.200]   in the United States.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.280]   But if you genuinely want to live really well,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.360]   and you genuinely want to spend as much money as you can,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.640]   and you don't wanna pay a lot of tax,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.200]   this is how you do it.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.600]   While I don't think it's practical
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.220]   to live totally tax-free,
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.700]   I do think that you can use this idea
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.360]   to be intelligent about your personal tax planning.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.880]   It's very important for investors
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.940]   to develop these capital gains assets
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.560]   while they have other income,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.240]   and then to use these sources of financing
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.640]   when they're recognizing other income.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.200]   Example, you're looking at a real estate portfolio
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.640]   and you're doing financial planning for yourself
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.880]   or for a client if you're a financial advisor.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   And you recognize, look,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.640]   we got $3 million of paid off real estate over here.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.460]   And then over here,
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.200]   we've got some assets where the tax has been deferred.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.640]   Well, if we could go ahead,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.200]   and the client wants to spend more money,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.400]   if we can borrow money
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.880]   on the real estate portfolio over here,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.760]   and then we can have that income,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.560]   now we don't have as high of an income.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.680]   So when we're taking distributions from a 401k,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.400]   we're taxed at a lower rate.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   So that can be an appropriate application.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.360]   You can use the credit card technique
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.000]   to shelter some of your income
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.400]   and allow you to provide some opportunities.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.840]   So for example,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.920]   if I were working with somebody
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.240]   who was just totally flexible,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.560]   and we're making up these clients,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.680]   they're not real life,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.440]   but just someone who's totally flexible.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.400]   Just pretend that you could spend an entire year
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.820]   living on your credit cards.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.120]   This is very easily done.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.200]   If you've got a good credit score,
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.520]   you've got a good credit history.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.840]   You can spend an entire year living on your credit cards.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.040]   Maybe you have a paid off house.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.320]   Maybe you're living in Airbnb's,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.640]   traveling around the world,
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.320]   but you're just swiping your credit card for everything.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.480]   It's not that difficult
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   to do that entirely interest free and expense free
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   by using a series of 0% introductory rate credit cards
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.160]   where you get 12 months or 18 months of financing.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.320]   So during that period of time,
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.560]   you don't need to create any taxable income.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.600]   You just simply borrow money for a year,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.380]   borrow money for 18 months.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.240]   Now, because you've borrowed money,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   your overall income declines massively.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.000]   So now is a good time where you can do Roth conversions,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.040]   and you can convert some of your 401k dollars to Roth dollars.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.160]   You can go ahead and sell capital gains assets.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   And when your earned income is very low,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.300]   you may be able to sell tens of thousands of dollars
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.960]   of assets at a 0% tax rate.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.320]   And so for somebody who's very flexible,
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   this can work really well.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.960]   Then the next year you go ahead,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.560]   you generate enough income from your,
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.960]   you will go ahead and recognize, excuse me,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.000]   recognize enough income
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.800]   from some of your other investment assets.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.020]   You can pay off the credit cards.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.600]   That's gonna be a high income year,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.760]   but that's a year that you don't do Roth conversions.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.600]   That's a year that you don't sell any other capital gains
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.280]   assets that are necessary, that aren't necessary.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.160]   But that year you go ahead and create income.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.760]   Then the following year you repeat.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.280]   This can also work as a form of bridge financing.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.920]   You use an asset and you combine all of the above.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   Somebody has a property,
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.200]   you go ahead and put a big mortgage on that property
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.840]   so that they can have income now.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.020]   This allows you to retire early
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.080]   because you're spending that income.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.160]   You can wait now until 59 and a half,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.360]   so there's no early retirement distributions.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.040]   And then during those years,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.700]   you go ahead and do a bunch of conversions.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.600]   You max out your conversions from a traditional IRA
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.880]   or a traditional 401k into a Roth IRA.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   You max those conversions out
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.880]   and then you'll be able to take that money tax-free again,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.920]   or you sell capital gains assets.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.080]   So the most important thing is for you
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.240]   to always look at the concept and remember,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.160]   hey, I could borrow money.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.040]   And if I borrowed money, that's not income.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.880]   And so now I have a tool at my disposal.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.520]   You can do this with life insurance.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.080]   You could take life insurance loans against cash value.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.320]   What's more interesting is if you are in a situation
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.240]   where you're planning with somebody who's terminally ill,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.960]   right, you use life insurance,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.400]   you take some sort of a viatical settlement.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.680]   You take loans against the life insurance
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.000]   using the life insurance as collateral,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.360]   maybe with friends or with,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.080]   you could do it with a company as well.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.680]   Just always remember in the back of your head,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.640]   if you need spendable money
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.400]   and you don't wanna pay tax, the answer is to borrow it.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.840]   Borrowed money is not income.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.160]   One would hope I wouldn't have to do any,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.680]   many disclaimers here.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.440]   I would just simply point out,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.760]   you always have to when dealing with debt.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.880]   We're not dealing here when we're talking about these ideas.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.080]   We're not dealing in a world where,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.720]   somebody is going out and just frivolously
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.280]   is buying stuff on credit cards
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.480]   that they can't afford to pay back.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.120]   That's dangerous.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.440]   And it's not tax-free either.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.120]   If you have debt that's discharged
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.880]   in a debt settlement of some kind,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.120]   you'll receive a 1099 for the amount of the debt
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.200]   that's discharged.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.600]   So don't think, oh, I'm gonna go out
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.720]   and I'm gonna borrow $100,000 on credit cards.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.480]   Then I'm gonna just stop paying
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.040]   and then I'll pay it back later at $15,000
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.200]   because that debt, you'll be taxed on it
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.960]   due to the forgiveness of debts.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.320]   So they're onto that one.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.520]   But if you can find the right set of assets
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.720]   or the right time, the right situation,
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.880]   you can genuinely put these strategies together
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.160]   and it can be useful for you in a tax planning context.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.360]   There are some other minor strategies
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.200]   that we can talk about,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.280]   but here's what you need to know about US income taxes.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.880]   Pretty much all the good loopholes have been closed.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.560]   You know, years ago,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.360]   if you watch online arguments about taxation,
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.440]   generally what people will do
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.760]   is they'll put up the marginal tax brackets of years past.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.240]   Marginal tax brackets in the United States
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.000]   have reached as high as, oh, is it 90 something percent?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.160]   Just insane numbers.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.400]   And so they'll say, well, look,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.320]   we had 80% taxation before and we did fine
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.840]   and we can do that again.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.360]   But what's often unrecognized
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   is how many loopholes have been closed since then
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.960]   of deductions, of exempt income,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.800]   of all kinds of different things.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.320]   And so in today's world, I've looked for years.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.600]   I've looked for years.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.720]   And you can find all these little ideas,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.760]   but basically it's mostly just piecemeal stuff.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.040]   Other than what I've just described,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.800]   there's no big idea
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.600]   that allows you to have millions of dollars.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.640]   And you can see the limited applicability
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   of the ideas that I've just outlined.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.800]   You can see that if I wanted to actually spend
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.520]   a lot of money, I would need so much money.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.560]   And how did I create the money in the first place?
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.840]   How did I actually do it in the first place?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.320]   You have to be a very skillful person.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.680]   And so there's virtually no way
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.160]   living in the United States
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.000]   to actually live income tax-free.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.680]   There are ways to manage it.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.440]   It's not the worst place in the world,
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.600]   but there's no way to genuinely live income tax-free.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.480]   And so that's why I so often talk about going somewhere else
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.120]   because you can genuinely live income tax-free
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.320]   in many parts of the world,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.960]   and you're welcomed with open arms.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.680]   But if you wanna live income tax-free
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.840]   in the United States,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.360]   always remember, borrowed money is not income.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.840]   That's all for today's show.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.520]   I remind you that until March 31,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.160]   you could save 50%.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   In this case, I don't 1099 you for the savings.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.720]   That's one good thing.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.120]   A borrowing, sorry, buying things on sale,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.720]   you don't, you need less income.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.520]   So you have to recognize less income,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.960]   but you don't get charged tax on money
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.000]   that you save on sales, or at least not yet.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.400]   But you can save 50% through March 31st
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.040]   on all of my courses that are available
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.320]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.920]   That sale ends on March 31,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.320]   but more importantly, those courses disappear on March 31.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.120]   In order to save, go to use coupon code changing platforms.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.840]   I'm removing those courses from the marketplace.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Gonna be adjusting them, reshooting them,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.040]   coming out with some more ones
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.320]   and some new ones in the future.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.800]   And so they are really good.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.400]   All the information is still current.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   I'm still active there.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.320]   We're doing a series of Q&A calls.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.040]   And I would encourage you highly,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.400]   if you've thought, if you heard me talk
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.640]   about some of these ideas,
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.800]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   I'd say probably the biggest deal there
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.440]   is probably that credit card course,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.960]   because I never charged what I should have for that course.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.160]   And now it's 50% off.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.280]   When it comes back out,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.160]   it's probably gonna be tripled or quadrupled in price
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.280]   because I'm gonna add a whole bunch to it.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.600]   But that credit card course is phenomenal.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.080]   And I've had several people that have used it
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.120]   to do what we're talking about today,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.480]   to use now credit cards as a form of bridge financing
