[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Uh, but first I want to do a quick news reaction because it's a, I find this
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.880]   article to be a, uh, confirmation of something I've been talking about on
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.300]   the show, something that I have been predicting, and now we see experts who
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.920]   are confirming what I've been talking about.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.400]   So here's the article.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   This came to me in my interesting account, newport.com email address.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.000]   Uh, it's from June 16th.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.560]   So it's a week or two ago and it's TikTok.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.720]   An executive from TikTok that is to some degree dunking on Facebook.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280]   And I want to get into details what they're saying here.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.720]   And if you're watching this on YouTube, you'll be able to see the article.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.480]   If you're listening, I'll tell you what I'll tell you what's on the screen.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.760]   All right.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.600]   So they're quoting in this article, a executive from TikTok, their president
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.360]   of global business solutions, and he's making a clear distinction between
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720]   TikTok and Facebook that I have made before.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.600]   So this executive named Blake Chanley says, Facebook is a social platform.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.080]   They built all their algorithms based on the social graph.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.200]   That is their core competency.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.880]   Ours is not.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000]   All right.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800]   He goes on to clarify what is TikTok.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   We are an entertainment platform.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.760]   The difference is significant.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.040]   It's a massive difference.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.200]   Now, this is something I've talked about multiple times before on the show, this
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.840]   idea that TikTok and its popularity actually represents an important transition
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.880]   in the landscape of these attention economy apps, and I actually think
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.160]   it is a positive transition.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.560]   So it's easy instinctually, if you're a social media skeptic, to look at TikTok
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.440]   and everyone looking at this and the 600 million users and be like, oh man, we're
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   going down the same road, but I actually think it's positive.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720]   And this is why, what this executive is saying.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.680]   TikTok is not playing the same game as Facebook.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.960]   It is not a social company.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.320]   Their revenue stream is not based off of monetizing a social graph.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.000]   It provides entertainment straight to the brainstem entertainment.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.880]   If you are bored, if you are trying to escape a moment of existential despair,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.520]   whatever the circumstance that wants you to get out of your current moment, you
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.440]   pull up TikTok's app, it's these short videos, algorithmically optimized and
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.880]   selected, boom, boom, boom.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240]   One after another, they hit these buttons in your brainstem.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.640]   Slack jaw, drool coming out of the side of your mouth, just locked in, distracted.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.320]   They are just optimizing, distracting entertainment.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.720]   No attempt to say, here's what your friend is up to.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800]   Here's an article that was shared by your cousin.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   Forget all that, just straight to the brainstem entertainment.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.000]   What the executive is saying is that Facebook, that's not what they were,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.680]   but they're trying to do this.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   This is the, the premise of this article is that Facebook is trying to, as I
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   previewed, they were increasingly shift over towards this TikTok model.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   Let me just put a quote here from the article.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.000]   Facebook plans to modify its primary feed to look more like TikTok by
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.840]   recommending more content, regardless of whether it's shared by friends.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.520]   And of course, why are they doing this?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.920]   It's because they are struggling.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.240]   Here's the numbers from the article.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.480]   The parent company of Facebook, Meta's stock price is down 52% this year,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.160]   underperforming the Nasdaq, which only dropped 32%.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.240]   In April, they said revenue in the second quarter could
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.320]   drop from a year earlier.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.680]   That'd be the first time that's ever happened.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.840]   So Facebook is struggling.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.160]   They see TikTok being successful.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.320]   Like, let's be more like TikTok.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.200]   I think, as I've said before, that is the beginning of the end for the
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.440]   social media platform monopolies.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   The one thing, 2010 Facebook, when it was really starting to get humming, the one
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.680]   thing it had going for it was network effects.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.480]   The people you know are on here.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.080]   If the primary use of this network is to connect with and see what people you know
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.240]   are up to, you have to come to our network and no one can compete with us because no
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.600]   one is going to be able to get everyone you know onto their network.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.440]   That is very hard.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   Once we've locked in with our first mover advantage, your cousin, your roommate,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.200]   your brother, your sister, they're all on here.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.280]   We have this first mover advantage.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.320]   You have to use our network because that's where the people you know are.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.160]   As soon as you move out of the game of connecting the people you know, facilitating
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.560]   the sharing of information between people who already know each other.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.840]   Once you move out of that game and move to the alternative game of brain stem
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.160]   manipulation, pure distraction, maximizing time on screen, we are the thing you want
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.520]   to look at when you're trying to escape the current moment, you lose that advantage.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.960]   It no longer matters that my cousin, my roommates, my brother, my sister on your
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   platform, if all I'm doing on that, as it says right here in this article is seeing
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.880]   content recommended by an algorithm that has nothing to do with what's going on with my
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.240]   friends.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.520]   So yes, maybe in the short term, it'll help Facebook stave off some of its numbers
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.680]   drops because they'll get more time on screen.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   But as I've said before, and I want to emphasize again, the biggest conclusion of
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.040]   this shift among these players is that you are now in a competitive pool where you don't
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.760]   have the powerful network effects of people I specifically know need to be on there.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.360]   And you are competing with anyone else who's trying to provide entertainment and
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.000]   distraction.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   That is a very competitive pool.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.880]   And it is a pool in which I think it is going to be impossible for any one company to
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.480]   dominate in the way that let's say a Facebook or an Instagram or a Twitter dominated our
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.920]   attention five, six years ago.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.880]   If you are just an app on my phone that can distract me, that app is next to my podcast
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.240]   player.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   That app is next to YouTube videos, that app is next to video streamers investing
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.320]   billions of dollars in high end entertainment that can come at me and be like any, unlike
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200]   anything else that we have seen before.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   Two hundred million dollar episodic series is competing with that is competing with
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   video games.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.800]   It's competing with books and audio books.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.280]   It's competing with other activities you might do in the analog world.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.040]   That is a much more competitive space.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.840]   And I think once you're in that pool where all we're offering is.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.080]   Distraction entertainment, all we're trying to do is to get eyes on screen.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.040]   Necessarily, people's digital interactions are going to fragment and go more niche.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.560]   There is no reason for there to be a dominant player.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.680]   TikTok is having a moment, but there's no reason for it to have to be something that
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.480]   everyone uses.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.280]   Most people don't.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.560]   It's popular, but there's no big issue if you don't.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.240]   In a world of just distraction, people are going to fragment or segment towards
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.960]   distractions that they like in particular.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   You're really into a certain type of sports.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.640]   Well, you're listening to that type of sports radio and podcasts by athletes in
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.320]   that sports.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.560]   Maybe you're a political conservative and you're over in like the Ben Shapiro
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   ecosystem, which has its own videos and its own shows all about stuff that you're
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.160]   interested in.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.880]   Maybe you're a board game enthusiast.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.040]   There's a place for that.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.640]   Maybe you're a Cal Newport type.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.760]   You're interested in deep life and getting away from the more distracted living.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.160]   So we have my videos, my podcast, my books.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.600]   It necessarily fragments once you no longer have the binding glue of the
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.840]   activity you're doing requires people, you know, to be here.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.800]   So I've been saying this, this article confirms it.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.320]   Here it is.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.720]   The head of tech talk saying, I'm not the head, but an executive at tech talk saying
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.600]   Facebook is trying to become more like us because they want their views to go up.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.280]   But good luck.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.800]   And I think he's right.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   You know, good luck.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.400]   If you try to become an entertainment company, you compete with everyone else.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.640]   So I see that as positive.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'm, I like tech talk, not actually using it.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.560]   But I like what it's doing.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.640]   Tick tock is causing these other platforms that so had us captured and had such a
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.400]   capture on our culture is causing them to accidentally knock the legs out of their
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   own proverbial table that get a short-term gain at the.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.080]   In exchange for their, their long-term downfall, which I think is good.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.440]   Social media universalism.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   When there was three platforms, everyone had to use.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.080]   I think we've seen for now it was bad for our civic culture.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.600]   It was bad for our mental health.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   It was bad for our ability to do anything else.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.840]   I don't like that moment where we all had to use three platforms, too much control,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.960]   too much power, too much negative externalities.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.360]   So this is good.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   Beginning of the end for that era of monopolies.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.720]   So we shall see.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.600]   You know what they said in this article, Jesse, that was a good analogy.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.160]   They said, Facebook, tick-tock was saying Facebook will never succeed at being
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.600]   tick-tock because you can't shift core competencies.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   And the analogy they gave is when Google tried to compete with Facebook.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.520]   So remember Google plus vaguely now that you say that, yeah, they put Google
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.120]   spent millions and millions.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.720]   And this was during Facebook's rise.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.040]   Like we want to do that.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   They spent all this money and they had a huge advantage to Google had a huge
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.160]   advantage.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.920]   If we can just make Google plus native to all of these Google apps that everyone's
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.880]   already using Gmail, the calendars, and they did.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   And it still failed.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.080]   And the reason why it failed is because Facebook had been built from the ground
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.520]   up to be a social graph company.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.640]   And they just did it really well.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.440]   Google had not, and they could never get over there.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.640]   And so in this article, the tick-tock executive is saying, good luck.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.960]   You're going to be the Google plus of these short videos.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960]   We know how to do it.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.240]   Our whole company's built around it.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.080]   You don't, it'll never be as good.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.400]   You're not going to peel people off.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.640]   But I like the fact that they're going to batter up their ship against the shore
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.160]   here, trying to do it because.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.840]   Man, we need to get past this moment of.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   Two platforms.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.600]   Did you listen to Zuckerberg's interviews with your buddy Lex and Tim?
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.920]   Yes.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.480]   I listened to the Lex one.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.960]   He's on with Tim too.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.120]   I think whichever one came out first, I listened to the Lex one.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.680]   Lex came out first.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   It's the problem with doing a tour like this for someone like that.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.880]   And then I was thinking, I don't know if I need to listen to.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.920]   It's like a book tour.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.880]   I don't need to listen to him again on another show though.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.520]   I'm sure Tim's interview was good as well.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.600]   Um, yeah, it was interesting.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.800]   He'll want to be on your show soon.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.040]   See, I'm not of this school of thought, this like Zuckerberg.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.080]   I think I'm, I'm with Lex on this.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.880]   Zuckerberg is not the devil, you know?
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   And, uh, I don't like the narrative.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   So I've, I've been a big opponent of some of these services.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.080]   It's not because I think they're nefarious, right?
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.200]   I don't think Zuckerberg is the devil.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.400]   I, I think it's too simplistic when we have to try to contrive these plotlines.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.760]   Of like, they're purposefully ignoring all this harm they're doing because
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.640]   they're so evil or this or that I don't think that's the case.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.720]   I just think social media universalism, which I can't blame them.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   I mean, Hey, if everyone's using this, we want to grow as big as possible.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.280]   I just think it was bad for our culture.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.880]   This moment of universalism where everyone felt like they had to use the platforms.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.680]   I think that is a problem.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.520]   I think if you have a platform, everyone is using, there's nothing you can do.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.360]   That's going to prevent that from probably having lots of negative externalities.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.040]   I don't think a lot of those are planned.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.840]   I mean, I think Facebook, they try to solve these problems.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.960]   They spend a lot of money on it.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.720]   Like we'll do anything you say we should do.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:12.480]   It's a losing battle because if you have 600 million daily active users from all
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.160]   sorts of walks of life all over the world, it's like an impossible challenge
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.840]   to make that into some sort of interesting.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.880]   The only solution that is segmentation.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.440]   No problem having small groups of people figuring out how they want to interact,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040]   what their standards are, what their norms that works out fine.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.840]   600 million people.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.240]   It's not natural.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.320]   Do you think he wants to work for the rest of his life?
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   I don't know.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.160]   I mean, don't bet against them long-term.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.880]   All I say is he's one of the only CEOs from that boom in that second internet
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.680]   boom period who's still CEO, but he's young.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.160]   I mean, you gotta be a bit of a killer.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.200]   Right.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.800]   The, the, the, the, the, the running that company at 22, how do you survive that?
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.760]   With the investor pressure to stay in charge.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.600]   I mean, this guy, he's gotta be a ruthless guy.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.520]   That is a hard game of Thrones style challenge.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   The Google guys didn't last.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.240]   Uh, the Instagram guys didn't last.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.680]   The Twitter founders didn't last or she was out of there.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.400]   It's very difficult.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.760]   The run a company, start a company in your young twenties, have it become a $500
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.640]   billion company and still be the CEO.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.520]   That means you're cracking skulls and stabbing people in the back.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.400]   Skulls and stabbing people in the ribs as they're like in the back
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.520]   room of the castle throne room.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.000]   Like that's not just, you're a nice guy working hard.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I think you have a business.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.440]   There's some sort of business instinct there.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.520]   That's very difficult to do.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.880]   Steve jobs got kicked out.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.720]   No one makes it.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.320]   Gates is the only other person I can think of.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.800]   Bill Gates is the only person I can think.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.880]   Well, maybe Larry Ellison.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.440]   There's other examples, but Gates is who comes to mind.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.360]   Gates started Microsoft as a kid.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.840]   And it almost identical situation is Zuckerberg dropping out of
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.080]   Harvard after his sophomore year.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.040]   It's like exactly the same as Zuckerberg.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.800]   And he held onto that company until he was ready to leave,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.240]   you know, 30 years later.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.480]   So like Gates and Zuckerberg Zuckerberg is Gatesian Amazon.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.720]   Bezos was older when he, you know, he was youngish, but, but he was at
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.880]   D E Shaw sort of analyzing the industry and was trying to figure out, got it.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.840]   How do we make a play for e-commerce and the internet?
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.640]   And he had no connection to books other than he just, so D E Shaw is
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.880]   this kind of weird, cool, quantitative investment fund.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.920]   Um, it's, they give people free reign and they hire only the smartest people,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.600]   but he was like very systematically.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.640]   What, how do we make e-commerce a thing?
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.080]   And he worked all the numbers.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.760]   It was like books, books, the way it works and that's the
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.200]   warehouses and the shipping.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.040]   Like we can make books work, but you're right.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.000]   Bezos was another example of, of he, he held on.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.680]   It kind of goes along with Mark and him working all the time.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.200]   It's kind of like what you're talking about when you answered that question
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:01.280]   in an earlier episode about just people always wanting to work and be doing stuff.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.720]   It's kind of like that.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.560]   They're driven guys.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.840]   I mean, Zuckerberg does all these challenges.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.840]   You know, the personal challenges.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.960]   Like I'm going to learn a language or master this skill or
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.720]   only, you know, not eat meat for a year.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.920]   It's like on top of his work, he's constantly giving himself
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   other types of personal challenges.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.120]   I mean, don't that's, that's rare again, to stay in charge of a company like that,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.880]   to have the extra energy to, to do, do what you do though.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.760]   I don't think Facebook is long for this world, but what can you do?
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.720]   I mean, they rode that moment as well as you could.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   And I, they did not successfully evolve beyond that.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.680]   I think Google was better at that.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.720]   Amazon was better at that.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.200]   They evolved very aggressively.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.280]   I think Facebook kind of doubled down on just being a social
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.320]   media platform monopoly.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.160]   And we want to do that well.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.520]   I don't know how long that'll last.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.160]   (upbeat music)
