[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   So the subordinate goal of this message, the one down from the ultimate, is that I would
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.320]   be able to make plain and defend the claim that truth triumphs through pleasure.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.240]   The ultimate goal of the message is that you and your people through you would feel that
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.040]   pleasure in God more intensely than you feel it in anything else.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:50.160]   Now to say that the goal of a message is that a people or a preacher would experience enjoyment,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:00.680]   experience pleasure in God, is not a contradiction to saying what the Bible says everywhere,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.560]   that the ultimate goal of all things, including this message, is the fullest possible exhibition
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.520]   of the glory of God in the age to come.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.880]   And the reason it's not a contradiction is because in the age to come that fullest exhibition
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.920]   of the glory of God is simply not going to happen if his people do not find their greatest
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.840]   pleasure in him.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.880]   It's not.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.640]   Huge things are at stake in the pleasure of your people in God.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.920]   I'm an Edwardsian lover of the glory of God down to my toes, and I want to read you a
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.280]   paragraph for why that's so.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.000]   This is Edwards at his best.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.280]   It appears that everything spoken of in the scriptures as an ultimate end of God's works
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.680]   is included in that one phrase, the glory of God.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   In the creature's knowing, esteeming, loving, rejoicing in and praising God.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   The glory of God is both exhibited and acknowledged.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840]   His fullness is received and returned.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.200]   Here is both emanation and remanation.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.240]   The refulgence shines upon and into the creature and is reflected back to the luminary.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.200]   The beams of glory come from God and are something of God and are refunded back again to their
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.040]   original so that the whole is of God and in God and to God.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.200]   And God is the beginning and the middle and the end in this affair.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.400]   I love Edwards and his God.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.160]   Now, I can't imagine a more God-centered, God-exalting, God-entranced paragraph than
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   what I just read.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   And tucked away in the middle of it is a statement worth a life.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.560]   It has shaped everything I do since I discovered it about 50 years ago.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440]   Here's the sentence.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:40.040]   In the creature's rejoicing in God, the glory of God is exhibited.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.920]   That's life-changing.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   That's ministry-changing.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.560]   It alters the way you preach, alters the way you parent, alters the way you live.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   In your rejoicing, in finding pleasure in God, God's excellencies are exhibited.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.000]   And if you don't have it, He isn't.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   This is huge.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.480]   It's huge for how we preach and how we live, what we seek to create by God's grace in our
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.680]   people.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   So here's what I'm going to do to try to make the case that truth triumphs through pleasure.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.280]   I'm going to make the connection with four things.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.560]   One, the connection between truth and ultimate reality.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.720]   Second, the connection between ultimate reality and God.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.920]   That's easy.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.280]   Third, the connection between God and preciousness.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.160]   And fourth, the connection between preciousness and pleasure.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.320]   That's where we're going.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.500]   Number one, the connection between truth and ultimate reality.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.340]   So the biblical words for truth, emet and almunah in Hebrew, aletheia in Greek, are
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.840]   used so many different ways, all kinds of nuances.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.340]   So you know, I'm sure you've all been well taught that you don't take a definition from
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.380]   Piper or MacArthur or anybody else and take it home and then lay it on a text and say,
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.620]   "This is what that word means."
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.580]   No, no, you don't do that.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.920]   Because the word is used in so many different ways, you let the text have its say about
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   what angle on truth is being meant here.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.580]   So I'm going to draw out two of those, two angles or two aspects, two ways the Bible
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.940]   talks about truth.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.060]   The first one is patently obvious, and we've heard all of them so far in this conference.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.340]   Number one, the Bible often speaks of truth as a characteristic of the things we say.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.620]   We say things that are true or false.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.660]   I think Mike even quoted this text, Proverbs 12:17, "Whoever speaks the truth gives honest
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.020]   evidence, but a false witness utters deceit."
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:20.500]   So when we think of truth this way, it's a characteristic of our statements about reality.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:28.940]   When we talk of truth this way, truth is a true statement and corresponds to reality.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.380]   But here's the second way, the one that I'm most interested in.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.940]   Not only does the Bible speak of truth as characteristic of statements about reality,
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.180]   but it talks about that reality as the truth.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.820]   So statements can be true and the reality is the truth.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.780]   There's two different ways of using the word truth.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.060]   For example, Acts 12, Peter is getting out of prison by the miracle of the angel, and
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.260]   it says, "Peter went out and followed the angel.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.740]   He did not know that what was being done by the angel was alethes."
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.540]   True, meaning I'm not dreaming.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.540]   It's real.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.940]   It's really happening.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:30.580]   Or 2 Corinthians 6:8, "We are treated as impostors and yet are alethes."
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.580]   We're true.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.580]   We're not impostors.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.300]   We're real.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.700]   So that's the meaning I want to take hold of in this particular connection here and
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.420]   press into it.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:08:09.640]   The truth not only states the truth, that reality is the truth.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.760]   So those two things are the statements can be true and the things about which they speak
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.940]   as true are the truth.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.140]   I am the truth.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.180]   You serve a true God.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.700]   So that's connection number one.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:34.120]   The connection between truth and reality is that reality is called often in the Bible
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.580]   truth.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.740]   And that points to ultimate truth, because Jesus says, "I'm the truth.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.900]   This is the true God."
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:50.780]   So we've got to now deal with the question, secondly, what's the connection between ultimate
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.180]   truth and God?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.700]   I said that was the easy one.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.100]   What is ultimate truth/ultimate reality?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.020]   And I think the most fundamental response to that question in the Bible is probably
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.340]   Exodus 3, 13 and 14.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.180]   I'll read it for you.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:19.460]   Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:36.340]   You shall say to them, 'God said to Moses,'" I didn't read that right, "They asked me,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.240]   'What is his name?
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.660]   What shall I say to them?'
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.180]   God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.'
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:54.100]   And he said, 'Say this to the people of Israel, 'I am sent me to you.'"
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:04.140]   Now the very least you can say about what that means is first, "I am I."
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.340]   I'm a person.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.060]   I'm talking to you right now, I.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:16.340]   Not it, not a wind, not thunder, I, a person, am talking to you.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.340]   I am who I am.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.540]   Second most obvious thing, I think, is I exist.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.780]   I am.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:30.700]   I'm real, not a myth, not imagined, not a Freudian projection, not a wish fulfillment.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:37.140]   I am more real than the ground you stand on, more real than the skin on your bones, more
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.360]   real than the galaxies at the end of the universe.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.820]   And the reason I'm more real is because all of those realities depend on my reality.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.440]   I am ultimate reality.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.400]   Only I, God, can say, "I am who I am."
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.820]   Everything else must say, "I am because He is."
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.440]   So this is the way ultimate truth talks.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.120]   I am who I am.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.220]   Nobody made me this way.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.880]   I simply am.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   Never had a beginning, never had an ending.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.240]   I never became.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.360]   I simply was from all eternity.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.440]   I will never end.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.640]   I depend on nothing, no cause, no support, no counsel.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   Everything depends absolutely on me.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.480]   Everything is secondary to me.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   The universe is infinitesimally small to me.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.840]   I carry it around like a peanut in my pocket.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   I never develop.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.960]   I cannot be improved.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   I'm absolute fullness and perfection.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.960]   I conform to nothing outside myself.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:55.120]   I am the standard of all perfection, all beauty and truth and goodness.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.960]   There are no constraints on me from outside.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   My good pleasure always holds sway.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.460]   My actions are absolutely free.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:10.400]   I'm never dictated to by anybody from outside myself.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.880]   I am who I am.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.480]   And for many years, I have circled back to this text every chance I get like a lightning
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.760]   bug looking at the sun.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.320]   I find it absolutely electrifying that God is.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:41.280]   You just need to lie down some night outside and look up and think he is, he was, he never
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.320]   began.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.120]   This all began.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.360]   He never began.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.120]   Just absolute reality.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.080]   That's my answer to the second question, which is easy to give.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.720]   The connection between, so question number one, the connection between truth and reality
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.400]   is that the Bible often uses the word truth to refer to reality and now ultimate reality
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.520]   and that ultimate reality second is God.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:20.580]   Now we turn to step three, the connection between God and preciousness, preciousness.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.240]   These next two, preciousness and pleasure, are the heart of the matter and I hope they
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.200]   sink in.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:35.520]   Is ultimate reality valuable?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.440]   Is ultimate reality of infinite worth?
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.400]   Is ultimate reality precious?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   Now those three questions I'm going to restate because I want to get at something and I can
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.160]   force it if I restate those questions slightly differently like this.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.280]   Is ultimate reality ultimate value?
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:14.160]   You hear the difference, not ultimately valuable but is ultimate reality ultimate value?
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160]   Is ultimate reality infinite worth?
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   Is ultimate reality infinite ultimate preciousness?
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:32.880]   So I'm going beyond saying God has value, has worth, has preciousness and I'm pushing
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:43.360]   it in to say, "No, no, it is Him, it is part of who He is," even though the word part is
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   a heresy, the word part is a heresy, but we grope, right?
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:01.280]   I'm pushing it in to say God is value, God is worth, God is preciousness.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Now why would I do that?
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.800]   Why am I pushing on that?
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.040]   Here's the reason.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.760]   Most people in the world are not born again.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:23.100]   Our calling is to, like Jesus said to Paul, "I'm sending you to open their eyes that they
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.200]   may turn from darkness to light and the power of Satan to God that they may have forgiveness
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   of sins."
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.000]   But you, you pastors are going to go out and through your ministry the miracle is going
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   to happen and people are going to be born again.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.640]   That's what we're called to do.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.400]   We want people to be saved.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.640]   We don't want to be the agent of people's destruction, we want them saved.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.920]   So they're out there, your people are talking to them, they come to your church, they're
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:16:00.760]   not yet born again, and if you were to ask any of those unregenerate people, "Is ultimate
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.880]   reality valuable?
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.220]   Is God valuable?"
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:20.600]   They might say, "Well, because they don't have any mental categories for being God-centered.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.560]   The mind of the flesh is hostile to God, does not submit to God, it cannot submit to God."
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.520]   You're asking them a question they cannot answer truly, so what are they going to say?
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.500]   They're going to say something like, "Well, I would hope that he or she or it, whatever
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:49.520]   ultimate reality is, would help me with my marriage and my job and my health and my children
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.480]   and my finances, that would be valuable."
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:04.580]   In other words, they would measure God's value by whether he's useful in helping them experience
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.480]   the pleasures that this world offers, that they can conceive of.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:16.120]   Now, some of those people come to your church and your people are hobnobbing with those
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.760]   people all the time, and here's what I'm suggesting.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:25.680]   I'm suggesting that a new set of questions just might shock them awake, might shock your
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.480]   people awake.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.720]   Is God ultimate value?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.640]   Is God infinite worth?
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.600]   Is God ultimate preciousness?
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:49.520]   Not just, does God have value or become useful to me in accomplishing the purposes that I
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.840]   have before I'm regenerate?
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   I think if we don't answer that question correctly, namely, is God infinite preciousness?
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.640]   Our theology, our worship, our obedience is going to go off the rails.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.360]   Certain things are at stake here in the way we live, in the way we do ministry.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.880]   So let me go to the scriptures now and try to answer this question.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:24.880]   In other words, are there scriptures that warrant this way of talking about preciousness?
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.400]   Is God infinite preciousness?
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.760]   Matthew 13, 44, very familiar, one word, one verse, parable.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:42.520]   The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:55.840]   up and then in his joy, he goes and he sells everything he has and buys that field.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:04.480]   So if the kingdom of heaven is a precious treasure, it's because the king is the treasure.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   Heaven will be heaven because God is there.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.600]   There is an ultimate promise.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.240]   Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.360]   He will dwell with them.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:32.360]   They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.840]   That's Revelation 21, 3.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:43.180]   So that's the consummation of the kingdom, God with us.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:50.960]   So the kingdom is a treasure and it's a treasure because the king is in the kingdom and he
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:20:00.420]   is the treasure, 2 Corinthians 4, 6 and 7.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.040]   God has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.560]   face of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.000]   We have this treasure.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.460]   I think that refers back to what he just said.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.320]   So God has spoken.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.300]   Our eyes have been opened.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:23.080]   We see the cross now and the gospel as a magnificent treasure.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.680]   The glory of God in the face of Christ.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:33.600]   We have this treasure in jars of clay so that the surpassing power belongs to God and not
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.040]   to us.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   So the glory of God in the face of Christ, tasted, experienced in our hearts is the treasure
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.520]   in the jar of clay.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:52.260]   The presence of God is the presence of treasure, infinite preciousness.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:58.500]   First Peter 1, 3 and 4.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.460]   God has granted to us his precious and very great promises.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.620]   Why are they precious?
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.680]   They are precious because they ultimately hold out to us the presence of God.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:17.340]   I don't know if you have a verse you go to bed with every night, but I'm old now, not
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.100]   as old as MacArthur.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:29.940]   I hope I can live as long as you have, which is only a few more years.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:35.880]   But when we get old, we think about death a lot, I do anyway, and what it will be like
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:42.460]   and how to get ready for it, and I think about going to bed at night and not waking up, I
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.860]   think about that almost every night, and so I have a verse.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   And it goes like this, "God," and I picture God saying it to me very personally, lay my
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:22:00.300]   head down on the pillow, I usually start on my left side, no right side like this, I can
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:11.940]   get my wife that way, and it says, "John Piper, God has not appointed you for wrath, but to
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:19.340]   obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for you, so that whether you wake
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:25.180]   or sleep, you will live with him."
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.180]   That's the salvation.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.180]   You live with him!
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.380]   You're going to live with him!
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.500]   That's the treasure.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.820]   That's the preciousness.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   That's the hope.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:41.540]   You go to bed, you don't wake up, great!
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.740]   With him, with him.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:53.820]   First Peter 1.18, "You were ransomed from the feudal ways inherited from your forefathers,
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:00.740]   not with perishable things like silver and gold, but with a precious blood of Jesus Christ
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.420]   like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:10.580]   The blood of Jesus is not precious because it saves us.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.140]   It saves us because it's precious.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.380]   In itself, the blood of the Son of God is precious.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.200]   He is preciousness.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.260]   First Peter 2.4, "You come to him, a living stone rejected by men, but in God's sight
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.220]   chosen, precious.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:41.820]   It stands in Scripture, 'Behold, I'm laying in Zion a cornerstone chosen, precious.'"
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:48.220]   God's evaluation of the Son of God is that he's precious, which means preciousness is
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.260]   in the Trinity.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.780]   That's why I say it's in God, it's in God.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.900]   It's not because of what he does.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.380]   He is precious.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.780]   He regards his Son as precious, the Son regards the Father as precious.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.040]   The Holy Spirit communicates the preciousness.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:16.780]   This is where preciousness gets started, only that's heretical, too, because nothing starts
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.620]   in God.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.860]   It's just always there.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   That's where it comes from.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:31.180]   The whole reality of preciousness is God, it's in God.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:38.740]   Revelation 21.1, "He showed me the holy city coming down out of heaven from God, having
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:45.220]   the glory of God, its radiance like a most precious stone."
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:51.020]   The glory of God filling the New Jerusalem is the city's preciousness.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.860]   Maybe that's enough on that point.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:04.820]   So from those texts, and many more, I conclude that infinite worth, infinite value, infinite
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:12.500]   preciousness are in God, intrinsically in God, forever in God.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:22.580]   God the Father enjoys God, the Son, and therefore the preciousness of the Son is in the Trinity
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:29.700]   and the preciousness of the Father, and together in all their perfect harmony, they are preciousness.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.940]   It belongs to the nature of God.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.100]   That's point number three.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:43.940]   So point number one, the biblical facet of truth as reality.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:50.020]   Point number two, that reality ultimately is God.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:26:01.420]   And point number three is that God is infinite preciousness, which leaves one last connection
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.500]   or question.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:15.980]   How does pleasure relate to preciousness in the Bible, not just in your head, but in texts?
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:21.180]   And I think we see the answer pretty clearly if we ask the question, what is the fitting
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:27.540]   human soul response to preciousness as the Bible presents it?
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.700]   So here's some, I've got three clusters of texts.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.980]   I think by clusters I just mean two in each group.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.200]   Number one, Matthew 13, 44, let's go back there.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.260]   We passed over a word too quickly because it wasn't time for it yet.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:51.260]   The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, a very precious discovery,
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:27:01.420]   which man found and covered up, and in his joy he sells everything and buys that field.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:08.380]   That's why so many missionaries have said, "I never made a sacrifice."
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:15.580]   In his joy, he's left it all to have the treasure.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.260]   So what's the answer to the question that corresponds to preciousness?
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.540]   Joy, pleasure, okay?
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.180]   That's number one.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.300]   That's fleshed out now in Hebrews 10, 34.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:38.340]   You had compassion on those in prison and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:49.460]   property since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one,
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.700]   more precious, more lasting.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:28:04.260]   The human response that corresponds to a better, lasting, more precious reward is you joyfully
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.900]   accepted the plundering of your property.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:16.040]   You can see almost immediately how radically transformative this will be for your people
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:22.620]   if they experience what this sermon is designed to help happen.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:28.300]   Do you make the pleasure of your people in God a goal?
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:35.340]   You know, gentlemen, you said last night, "What are we after in our people's lives?"
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.780]   And everybody said, "Obedience."
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.780]   So did I.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.780]   Amen.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.100]   But you had already quoted, "If you love me, you will obey me."
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.560]   So I'm thinking, "I'm after love, folks."
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.220]   And you are too.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.540]   And because that love, that love is not equal to obedience and that love is not equal to
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.540]   agape.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.100]   That love is erotic to the core.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.620]   That's an overstatement.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:06.580]   Eros means, "I find pleasure in you, Jesus.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.940]   I find pleasure in you, Jesus.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.320]   You are my preciousness."
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.820]   And there comes obedience, which is why I loved every word in that sermon.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.180]   And it is so needed because John is so right.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.980]   He's fighting that battle with the gospel according to Jesus.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.900]   Back when I loved that book when it first came out, and we're still fighting it today
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.060]   because there's less interest in holiness today than there ever was, as far as I can
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.060]   remember.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   So, amen.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.140]   Let's do it.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.460]   And let's go to the root of the matter.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   Second cluster of texts.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.580]   So that's Hebrews and Matthew for the first cluster, and now here comes Philippians and
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.720]   Habakkuk.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.140]   Twice in Philippians, Paul says, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.660]   3.1, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.180]   4.4, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.820]   And again I say, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:03.260]   Why is that a fitting way of responding to the Lord?
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:09.660]   And he told us in chapter 3, verse 8, "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:15.460]   preciousness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.020]   I look at everything and count it as rubbish.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:30.220]   I look at Jesus and say, "Joy, precious, beyond words, I'll lose everything for that."
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:36.980]   That's why joy is fitting, pleasure is fitting in Jesus.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   Here's Habakkuk.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.860]   Now Habakkuk, I said I go to sleep on a text.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.460]   I got married on this text.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:52.260]   I'll bet not a single person in this room, unless they copied me because they're young,
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.020]   used this text at your wedding.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.620]   If you come up to me or send me a note or something, I'd love to know if you did.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:08.120]   This is Habakkuk 3, 17, "Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:16.380]   the produce of the olive fail, and fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:25.240]   fold, and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will take
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:32.060]   joy in the God of my salvation, and starvation is just over the horizon."
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:38.160]   There's nothing there.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.280]   There is no food.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:51.400]   You have any idea why we would build our marriage on that?
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.760]   We have been through really hard times, and we could see them coming.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.880]   My Sunday school teacher told me, "John, you and Noel will never make it.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.160]   You'll never make it.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.980]   You're analytical to the core.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.880]   She's carefree as a bird.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   It won't work."
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:18.280]   Well, it has, 55 years worth.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.880]   Because of that text, we'll go through hell to stay married.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.440]   We will stay with Jesus who says, "Divorce is not an option, and he will be sufficient
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.960]   for you no matter what."
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:39.020]   That is a great verse to build a marriage on, or anything else, for that matter.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   Just think of it.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.680]   How could he possibly talk like that?
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.040]   "I don't have anything to eat.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.420]   There's no animals.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.780]   There's no vines.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.240]   There's nothing coming in.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.720]   I've got no income.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.800]   I will rejoice in the Lord," because he's infinite preciousness.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.600]   He's 10,000 times better than anything.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.360]   The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   Come on, if you don't know that verse, you're in trouble.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.000]   That's Psalm 63, 3.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Let's try it again.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.420]   The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.240]   Thank you.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.980]   Third cluster of texts.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:29.000]   That one was, what did I say, Habakkuk and Philippians with a little Psalm 63 thrown
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   in.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.680]   Finally, Hebrews and Psalms, third cluster.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:44.380]   Hebrews 11, "Moses chose rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:55.460]   pleasures," fleeting pleasures, like they only last 80 years, "the fleeting pleasures
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.880]   of sin.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:05.120]   He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth," preciousness, "than the treasures
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.720]   of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward."
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:17.860]   Moses is saying, "I've got pleasures.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.500]   I've got the whole court of Egypt at my disposal.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:31.780]   I'm his adopted son or grandson, and I've got all the pleasures I want."
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:41.800]   And he reasons, "Well, they'll only last a lifetime, and I've got a better wealth
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:49.260]   following the Lord and leading this cantankerous people through the wilderness, and I think
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:55.240]   I'll go with infinite preciousness rather than what Egypt has to offer."
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:02.960]   Now, Psalm 1611, it's the last one we'll look at.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:10.520]   Psalm 1611, kind of a life verse along with a few others, is a Psalm that does not hesitate
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   to use the word pleasure.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.200]   Now, some of you might be kind of wobbly about, "Joy is fine.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.660]   Don't talk about pleasure though.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   Joy is good.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.040]   Joy is Bible.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.120]   Pleasures is not Bible.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   That's world."
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.880]   No, it's not true.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.920]   If you do a word study on trying to figure out which words for joy or pleasure or delight
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.040]   fit the Christian heart, they're all over the place.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.520]   Every one of them do.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.520]   Just do your study.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.080]   Just look them all up, and the Bible is utterly discriminant for words that apply to sinful
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.720]   pleasure and words that apply to godly pleasure.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.320]   They're the same words.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.880]   You just got to decide that it's okay to delight in God.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:00.500]   I mean, a lot of Reformed people are scared to death that Piper talks this way.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:06.000]   I can't even get into some places, they're so scared.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.600]   This is risky for MacArthur to have me here, like probably the only person in the room
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.160]   raising his hand, you know?
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:28.860]   I didn't want to turn around.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:35.080]   And I know that MacArthur standing beside me with both his hands beside his body has
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:43.840]   as much pleasure in Jesus as I do.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.300]   My heart is glad and my whole being rejoices, for you make known to me the path of life.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.040]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:37:00.360]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.500]   So the gladness of the heart that we know now, which is so weak and so partial and so
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:13.840]   inadequate, is a foretaste of that, and it will be fulfilled someday.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.360]   So which brings us now to one last text, I think I said that was the last one, it's not
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.400]   the last one, this is the last one.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:28.180]   So 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, this is a most provocative text in so many ways.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:32.380]   It's talking about the man of lawlessness, right?
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:40.160]   And here's what Paul says about that last time about the man of lawlessness, "The coming
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:48.700]   of the lawless one," this is verse 9, "The coming of the lawless one is with all wicked
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:57.540]   deception for those who are perishing because they," and then here the translations are
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:05.100]   all over the place, "They did not welcome a love for the truth."
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:11.060]   They didn't welcome a love for the truth.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:20.740]   Now that love, that doesn't mean self-sacrificing love, that means cherishing love, delighting
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.300]   love, embracing love.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.940]   I love the truth.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:37.300]   And so be saved, verse 11, "Therefore God sends them a strong delusion so that they
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:45.340]   may believe what is false," he's done, he's handed them over, "in order that all may be
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:51.540]   condemned who did not believe the truth," that's why I wrote a whole book on what is
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.700]   saving faith because of that verse, "believe the truth," that's another issue, leave that
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:03.060]   over there, "did not believe the truth, but," what's the alternative, "had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:12.980]   So you've got, "They didn't love the truth, they had pleasure in unrighteousness," which
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:20.740]   is just what John was getting at with John chapter 3, the light is coming to the world.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:26.540]   People loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil, they loved righteousness,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:34.780]   unrighteousness, and they did not love the truth, which I take to mean they didn't have
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:40.300]   pleasure in the truth because that's the word used for the opposite, they had pleasure in
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.060]   unrighteousness.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:51.700]   They didn't delight in the truth, they didn't find pleasure in the truth as precious and
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.860]   so they did not believe the truth but instead had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:03.420]   The truth here is the word of God, the gospel especially, and it's the gospel of the glory
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.700]   of Christ and therefore not to find pleasure in the word of truth, the gospel is not to
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.020]   find pleasure in Christ and his glory.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:23.020]   Now conclusion, see if you can put the pieces together with me.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:31.820]   When in the final glorification of the bride of Christ, when in that final glorification
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:39.140]   of the saints, the bride of Christ experiences, now these are your people I'm talking about
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:44.060]   and the day is coming very soon when they'll be in this condition and then finally all
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:53.620]   of us in the kingdom, when in that final glorification of the saints, the bride of Christ experiences
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:41:05.140]   her supreme pleasure in the infinite preciousness that is God, then infinite preciousness in
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:11.460]   God will be exhibited.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.860]   The goal of the universe, as Edward said, as so many texts say, the goal of history,
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:24.020]   the goal of redemption, the goal of creation is the fullest exhibition of the glory of
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.220]   God in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:38.000]   And I'm saying that absolutely will not happen if the bride does not find her fullest pleasure
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.780]   in the bridegroom.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.380]   It won't happen.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   And if you believe that, that the fullness of the bride's pleasure in the bridegroom
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:56.020]   is an absolutely essential component of the fulfillment of the purposes of the universe,
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.700]   it's going to affect your ministry.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.260]   It's going to affect what you're after.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:13.100]   And when that happens, truth, ultimate reality, God, ultimate preciousness will be vindicated
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.940]   and truth will triumph through pleasure.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.980]   Let's pray.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:28.340]   Father in heaven, this is a miracle I'm asking for, for myself, for our churches, for these
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.340]   pastors.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:42.380]   We long to taste as fully as fallen, justified, sanctified people can do, to taste as fully
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:49.380]   as we can taste the pleasures at your right hand manifest in the word through Jesus Christ.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.300]   So God worked that miracle in these brothers.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:59.540]   Some of them are so emotionally broken, so lame, so limited, so constrained that this
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:03.760]   sounds like a foreign language.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.580]   And that's true of all our people.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:14.060]   And like John said this morning or last night, compassion is that first prerequisite.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:19.140]   If we're going to call our people to do the impossible, namely experience Christ as so
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:24.620]   satisfying they're willing to let everything else go and still rejoice, a miracle has to
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.620]   happen and we need to be patient while you do it.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.500]   So help us, I pray in Jesus' great name.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.060]   Amen.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.640]   (gentle music)
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
