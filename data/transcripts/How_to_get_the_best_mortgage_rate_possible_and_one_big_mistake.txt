[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.520]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.020]   And in this episode, I want to talk
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.000]   about getting the best mortgage interest rate possible.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.260]   Right now, everybody should be trying to refinance.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.840]   If you haven't refinanced in a year or two,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.360]   now is the time because the 10-year bond yield is at 1.5%
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   or even less.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   All around the world, rates are going down.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.480]   Some places, like in Denmark, have negative interest rates.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.200]   So that's been a boon for consumers and borrowers.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   Now, to get the best mortgage interest rate possible,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.040]   it's all about relationship pricing.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000]   What do I mean by relationship pricing?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160]   Well, it's about bringing new assets to a lender
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.040]   so they can give you a better rate than the market.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.280]   Usually, the tiers are $250,000, $500,000, and $1 million.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.640]   So in other words, if you bring $250,000 over in new assets
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.760]   to a new lender, you will get one rate.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.240]   And then if you bring in $500,000,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920]   you get an even lower rate.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.800]   And $1 million, you'll get an even lower rate.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.360]   So you get bigger credits, in other words.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.480]   So why do banks do that?
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.280]   Well, it's obvious.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   They're trying to drum up more business from new customers.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.400]   Really, the perfect customer is one
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.720]   that opens multiple types of accounts with a bank.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.520]   It's not just checking and savings.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020]   It's checking savings, mortgage, personal loans, credit cards,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.000]   and so forth.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.880]   And then hopefully, the relationship
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.960]   is good and nice and sticky, as they like to say.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840]   And then you refer other people to the bank.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.000]   And they become lifelong customers and so forth.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   So what happened with me was that I've
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.560]   had a 19-year relationship with Citi Bank.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.160]   I have multiple accounts open.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   I've referred multiple, multiple people to the bank.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.920]   So I thought, our relationship is pretty good.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   I'm a Citi, quote, "gold" customer.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520]   And so one week, they said, hey, why don't you
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   refinance with us?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.720]   Well, I was looking and seeing what the best rates were.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.040]   At the time, it was 3% for a 10/1 arm,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.320]   which I thought was OK.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.600]   I was refinancing a 2.5% five-year arm that
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.120]   was coming due in August 2019.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.900]   And 3%, it's OK, but I wanted that magical 2 handle, right?
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.580]   Something like 2.875%.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.800]   And so I just let them know, look, that 3% is good,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.040]   but I'm hoping for 2.875%.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.160]   And so the loan officer told me, well,
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.080]   just lock in 3% with us this week,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.800]   and we're going to do some special pricing, promotional
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.520]   pricing next week.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.120]   And we're going to be able to get you 2.875%.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   So given that I had been working with them for a long, long time,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.320]   I had no reason not to believe them.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   So I decided to lock 3%, OK, and then wait a week later.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.000]   And a week later came, and they said, sorry,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.920]   we can't do 2.875%.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   And I was like, what do you mean, sorry?
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.120]   That's what you told me.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.960]   And of course, he didn't say it in writing, in an email.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.000]   And he said, look, I talked to my manager,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.600]   and I just couldn't do it.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.160]   And so that really, really put a bitter taste in my mouth.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.720]   That was like a bait and switch, like come in here,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.520]   look around, see if you like anything,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.320]   and we'll take care of you.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.240]   Don't worry about it.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.800]   You know those car advertisements
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.840]   where there's a too-good-to-be-true ad where
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.680]   it's like $199 for a very fancy car that should be more like
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   $600 a month or whatever.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   And you get there, and you realize, oh, it's
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.480]   already been sold, because in fine print it says,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.000]   well, there's only one available at this price.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.800]   But come on in, sucker.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.160]   So I really felt like a sucker.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   So not one to reward broken promises,
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.360]   I decided to cancel the mortgage refinance.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.680]   And it wasn't just canceling a week or two weeks
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.600]   after I realized I couldn't get 2.875%.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.620]   I decided to go through the stringent process of getting
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.280]   all the documents they needed, talk to the manager
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.360]   and the loan officer multiple times,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.560]   because I'm a glutton, glutton for punishment.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.540]   And I decided to cancel about 7 to 10 days
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.520]   before it was about to close.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   I'd been going through this process for already two months.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.920]   And I got to admit, part of me wanted
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.440]   to go through this process because I'm
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.120]   a glutton for punishment, but also
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   because I wanted to see if I could learn something
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.960]   new in this latest mortgage refinance process.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.760]   Oh, and they also said, look, there's no cancellation fee.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.000]   So I was going for a free ride here,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.440]   and I'm always looking to learn.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.200]   So why not?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   Why not go through the process, cancel?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.680]   Because I still had a couple months left
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.280]   before my 5-1 arm was to reset in August.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.960]   Not one to reward broken promises,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.080]   I decided to hunt elsewhere.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   And I found a better deal with Wells Fargo, which
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   offered me 2.875% for a 7-1 arm with no refinance fees,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.680]   plus a $2,000 credit.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   So the old mortgage refinance was a 10-1 arm,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.760]   so slightly longer.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.340]   And that's good, but I wasn't planning
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.560]   on holding it for more than five to seven years anyway.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.840]   But it was at a higher rate, 0.125%, right, at 3%.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   And I had to pay $1,500 to refinance.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.720]   So Wells Fargo seemed like a pretty good deal.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.240]   A little bit lower rate, and I had this credit.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.680]   That's like a $3,500 savings.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.080]   So I decided, you know what?
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.480]   I'm going to go with you guys.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.280]   And to get that rate, I would have
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.120]   to transfer $750,000 in new assets over to the bank.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.380]   Thankfully, I did have that amount,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.460]   because I have this old, slow-moving portfolio full
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.660]   of municipal bonds and some stocks
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.000]   that I plan on never trading and just holding for next 10
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.420]   to 20 years.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.320]   And because I wasn't going to trade it,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.620]   it didn't really matter whether I held the portfolio at Citibank
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.940]   or with Wells Fargo or whomever.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.260]   And so this was my opportunity to get a better rate.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.700]   But before I agreed with Wells Fargo,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.500]   I gave Citibank one last chance.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.220]   I said, hey, guys, I've got this great offer with a better
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.860]   rate and better terms.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.740]   Can you match it?
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.500]   Because after all, you said you were going
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.900]   to give me 2.875% anyway.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.860]   Just do the right thing.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.620]   I talked back and forth and everything,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.780]   and I was even willing to accept 2.875%, the match rate,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.500]   and pay their $1,500 in fees instead of getting a $2,000
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.140]   credit just to keep things simple.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.040]   Because you know what?
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.660]   It is a pain in the butt to move assets
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.060]   and to go with a new relationship.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.620]   You're taking a risk.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.360]   So I thought surely Citibank would agree,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.520]   because I had a written offer and everything.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.420]   I sent over the email, and it was just clear as day.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.060]   I had been a great customer since 2001.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.060]   Multiple accounts open, multiple referrals.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.340]   Surely they would say, yes, I will honor our verbal promise.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.980]   However, they still said no.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.420]   So you know what?
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.300]   You just got to move with your feet
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.020]   and just take your assets elsewhere.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.140]   I talked to the Wells Fargo guy, and I said, OK, I'm in.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.220]   Please don't let me down.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.540]   And he said two months should be more than enough time
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.460]   to get the refinance squared away
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.340]   so that I'd be paying the lower 2.875% rate come August 1st
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.020]   instead of my new reset rate of 4.5%.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.640]   And I believed him.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.820]   And that's where things went wrong again.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.660]   I'm now in my third month of refinancing.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.220]   I can see the end, but it is definitely not
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.180]   two months where 50% beyond what he said would happen.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.980]   So what happened?
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.940]   Well, life got in the way, I guess.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.580]   Well, interest rates really started
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.700]   to continue going down after I locked with Wells Fargo.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.580]   And so that created a huge rush of mortgage refinancing.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.860]   Mortgage refinancing is up 50% year over year in July,
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.420]   and it's probably going to be a similar amount in August.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.780]   So that's created a huge backlog for the underwriters.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.060]   And I don't know whether they're just giving me excuses or not.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.780]   Because when there's more work to be done,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.900]   I just work harder to get it done and reach that deadline.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   Because when I make a promise, I do everything possible
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.060]   to fulfill that promise.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.380]   So once again, what I realize is that there's
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.180]   a lot of bait and switching, or maybe
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.660]   that's too harsh of a phrase.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.940]   There's a lot of overpromising and underdelivering
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.220]   to win a new client's business.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.060]   So I need you guys to realize that the rate they say
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.900]   might not be the rate that you end up with,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.300]   or the timing they guide won't be the timing that you'll
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.540]   end up with.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.300]   I would bake on three to four months
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.540]   to successfully refinance a mortgage.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.260]   Long gone are the days where you can refinance a mortgage
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.980]   within 45 days.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.540]   After the financial crisis, things
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.980]   have gotten a lot more stringent.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.820]   And as rates have come down, down, down, more and more
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.380]   people are wising up to try to take
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.820]   advantage of these lower rates by refinancing their mortgage.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.740]   I've calculated that each day past August 1st,
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.180]   my mortgage refinance does not close,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:22.580]   is costing me an unanticipated $33.56 in extra interest.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.140]   Because I'm now paying the new 4.5% rate instead of the new 2.75
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.460]   or 2.875% rate.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.500]   So over a 30-day period, that's an extra $1,005
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.260]   in mortgage interest expense.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.100]   I did not calculate when I was trying
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.220]   to figure out between Citibank and Wells Fargo.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.980]   So this is something you guys really
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.340]   need to put your loan officer's feet to the fire and say,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.660]   hey, what do you think is the realistic timing
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.580]   of the mortgage refinance?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.700]   When he says one month, don't believe him or her.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.300]   If he says one or two months, I still
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.060]   wouldn't believe him or her.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.700]   Three to four months is really the realistic option right now
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.580]   because the banks are indeed flooded.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.780]   And if you refinance sooner than three or four months,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.940]   then great, you're going to be winning.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.580]   And if you don't, you've got to make sure you're not
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.060]   paying the rate lock extension.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.660]   Make sure the bank is paying that rate lock extension.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.100]   It's not your fault if they're dragging their feet.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.700]   And they should realize this, but make
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.340]   sure they don't drag their feet to try
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.620]   to win more business for their bank
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.460]   while also sticking you with a rate lock extension fee.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.620]   Then that would be really, really bad,
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.540]   especially if you're two months, two and a half months into it.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.940]   Can you imagine?
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.380]   This has happened to multiple readers of Financial Samurai
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.940]   over the years because I've been writing about mortgage refinance
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.820]   since 2009.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.220]   And there are a lot of straggling banks out there.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.660]   Their main objective is to corral as many of you guys
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.020]   as possible.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.100]   And you know what?
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.180]   If you guys take longer than possible,
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.020]   well, they're going to operate at their own pace.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.540]   So folks, the lesson here is to do the math
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.940]   and run worst case scenarios where your mortgage refinance
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.040]   will take maybe four months to refinance.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.860]   And then calculate that extra interest payment
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.300]   that you would have to pay because of this delay.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.980]   For those with 30-year fixed mortgages,
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.740]   it shouldn't matter as much how long the refinance takes
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.260]   because your mortgage rate isn't resetting.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.580]   But to save money, you should still refinance and push
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.340]   to have a quicker close.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.940]   Paying a 30-year fixed rate mortgage
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.420]   has proven to be a suboptimal choice
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.780]   as interest rates have come down since the late 1980s.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.540]   And this is a topic, whole nother topic,
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.460]   30-year fixed or ARM.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.900]   But I am an ARM believer because I
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.740]   believe interest rates are going to go down or stay low
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.820]   for the rest of our lifetimes.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.180]   If you have an ARM, your ideal scenario
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.900]   is to refinance into another ARM one week
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.420]   before your existing ARM is set to expire.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.180]   Then you avoid the new higher reset rate, which usually
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.860]   is at max 2% higher than your existing ARM.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.460]   So hopefully you guys got a lot out of this podcast.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.220]   It truly is a frustrating experience for me to refinance.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.700]   And I fear that it's going to be a little bit frustrating
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.140]   experience for you as well.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.500]   Getting all those documents and everything
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.740]   is really a painful, painful process.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.100]   And my refinance has taken so long
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.860]   that I've had to resend multiple documents because they expired.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.180]   So I hereby solemnly swear never to refinance a mortgage again
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.860]   after this one is done.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.500]   I'm either going to pay cash for a new property
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.380]   or just let things ride and not buy something new.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.100]   Because at my age and my stage in life,
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.660]   I just don't have time for this.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.740]   But I hope you guys do, because saving money
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.060]   is always a worthwhile endeavor.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.100]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.660]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.900]   love to receive a positive review.
