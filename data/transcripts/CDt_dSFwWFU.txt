[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   Welcome back. We're joined again by Dr. Don Whitney, professor of biblical spirituality
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   and associate dean of the School of Theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.320]   in Louisville. Don is known for his classic book, Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.420]   Life, and he is the author of a new book from Crossway. It's titled, Praying the Bible.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.920]   We're talking about the spiritual disciplines, and Don, I know you hear this question all
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.700]   the time because it's an important one. In the Christian life, what are the two most
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.480]   important personal spiritual disciplines that we can engage in? What is your answer when
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.340]   it comes to priority?
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.000]   The answer to that is very clear. The two most important personal spiritual disciplines
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.840]   are the intake of the word of God and prayer, and in that order. For it's much more important
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.440]   for us to hear from God through his word than for God to hear from us in prayer. So it is
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.280]   essential that those two have priority. Furthermore, all the other biblical spiritual disciplines
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.080]   grow out of those. Particularly, they grow out of the word of God. So something like
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.600]   fasting or whatever, we find that in the word of God. It's shaped by the word of God. Our
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.400]   instruction for doing that is found in the word of God.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   Now what I've discovered though is that people want to say, "You know, I go to a good Bible
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.160]   believing church, and every time I come to church it seems in one way or another I hear
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.920]   about intake of the Bible and prayer. Give me something else. Give me something more
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.880]   exotic. Talk about some of the more exotic spiritual disciplines like fasting or solitude
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120]   or keeping a journal, something like that."
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.660]   If someone is not founded, grounded well in the word of God and prayer, forget fasting.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.280]   Forget journaling. The foundation is the word of God and prayer. And I say that as a note
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.240]   to pastors and teachers, people who are teaching on the spiritual disciplines, if your teaching
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   on the spiritual disciplines does not result in people at the very least becoming more
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360]   consistent in the word and in prayer, forget all the other ones. People are more interested
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.560]   in them perhaps because they've heard less about them, and we do want to teach what the
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.760]   Bible teaches about them, and they're in the scripture, and we want to teach them. But
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.560]   don't let an interest in the more obscure disciplines keep people from being inconsistent
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.920]   in terms of the word of God and prayer.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.040]   Now with those two most important personal spiritual disciplines, I've found there's
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.280]   an almost universal problem. With the intake of the word of God, it looks like this. People,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.920]   even our most devoted daily Bible readers, will read a chapter, read three chapters,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.840]   however much it is. Once they're finished, they close their Bible. And most days, if
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.640]   pressed, as soon as they close their Bible, they would have to admit, "I don't remember
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.080]   a thing I've read." In fact, many days, I can't even tell you where I've read. I believe
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.060]   the simple, permanent, biblical solution to that is to meditate on scripture. Not merely
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.960]   to read, but meditate. People say, "You know, I just can't remember what I read, though."
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.840]   But if it takes a person, let's say, two seconds to read verse one of a chapter, then two seconds
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.620]   to read verse two, then two seconds to read verse three, you can have a thousand two-second
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.920]   encounters with the word of God and not remember a thing you've read. Because what do you ever
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   remember that you look at for two seconds? Occasionally something, but not very often.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.120]   So the problem is not your memory, it's not your IQ, it's not your education, it's your
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.040]   method. So I'd encourage people who say, who are listening to this and say, "But you don't
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.640]   get it. I only have a very few minutes every day and I'm doing the best I can. Now you're
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.760]   telling me to add to that. I don't have time to add to that." Okay, let's say you only
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.080]   have 10 minutes for the word of God. Don't read for 10 minutes. Read for five minutes.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.300]   Meditate for five minutes. Far better to read less, if necessary, and remember something
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.400]   than to read more and remember nothing. And with prayer, I found that the almost universal
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.260]   problem is this. People tend to say the same old things about the same old things in prayer.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.600]   And sooner or later, that's boring. When prayer is boring, you don't feel like praying. When
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.640]   you don't feel like praying, it's hard to make yourself pray. It's just duty prayer.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.760]   It's just obligatory prayer. It's joyless, it's bloodless, it's heartless. Now to pray
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.700]   about the same old things is normal. Our lives tend to consist of the same old things from
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.880]   one day to the next. Our lives don't change dramatically from one day to the next very
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.280]   often. Simple, permanent, biblical solution to that almost universal problem. When you
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.520]   pray, pray through a passage of scripture, particularly a song. You do that, you'll pray
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.540]   about the same old things every day, but you will never again say the same old things about
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.960]   the same old things. You won't run out of anything to say. You don't need any other
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.320]   notes. You don't need anything else. Just open your Bible, talk to God about what comes
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.960]   to mind from the word of God, and you'll never again say the same old things.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.880]   That's a brilliant way to read and process the Bible and pray at the same time. And this
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.200]   episode is also a great lead in to mention your newest book once again from Crossway.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.320]   It's simply titled "Praying the Bible," and you can find more on how to do this very thing
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.440]   as a spiritual discipline in your daily life in Dr. Whitney's new book. Thank you, Dr.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.960]   Whitney, for your time. So what spiritual discipline is the hardest? I'll ask tomorrow.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.580]   Thanks for listening to the podcast. For everything you need and to send us your questions and
