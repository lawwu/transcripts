[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Hi, I'm Cal Newport.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.440]   Of the things I am known for,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.320]   perhaps the most prominent is the fact
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.740]   that I have never had a social media account.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.800]   No Facebook, no Twitter, no Instagram,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.520]   no TikTok, no Snapchat.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.040]   Now, as someone who writes about technology
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   and its impact for culture,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.240]   this has been a really big advantage for me.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.560]   It gives me distance from the culture I'm writing about.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.520]   I can observe with some clarity
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.580]   the impact of these tools on our lives
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.240]   without actually having to be completely overwhelmed
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.880]   by these tools myself.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760]   I have become convinced over the years, however,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.640]   that there are perks to not using social media
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.520]   that are applicable to everyone,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.840]   not just to people like me
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720]   who write about technology for a living.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.000]   So that's what I wanna talk about in this video,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.780]   four perks to not using social media.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.240]   Number one, more boredom.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.480]   Now, this might be surprising at first,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.920]   but follow with me here.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   One of the things that happens
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.600]   when you have these highly addictive applications
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.120]   on your phone is that your phone
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.760]   becomes a default mode of distraction.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.160]   At the slightest hint of boredom,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   you whip this thing out
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.760]   and start scrolling through those social media apps.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   I can't blame you for doing that.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.520]   They have been engineered
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.400]   by some of the smartest people in the world
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.420]   to be incredibly compelling.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.260]   So why sit there in line and just be bored
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.140]   when you can have tens of billions of dollars
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.220]   worth of attention engineering at your service
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.620]   to give you that perfect moment of distraction?
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.620]   There is, however, a cost to having this perfect,
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.780]   always accessible distraction there in your pocket.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.660]   That means there is no more boredom in your life.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.020]   The slightest hint of boredom, you're looking at that phone.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.160]   This can be a problem.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.580]   So what happens when you're alone with your own thoughts?
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.980]   Because you don't use social media,
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.220]   so there is nothing on that phone
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.100]   that's all that interesting to look at.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.260]   It's a situation I find myself in all the time.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.580]   You're now left to just think about the world around you,
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.980]   what's going on in your head.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.700]   That might sound scary at first,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.420]   but it's actually critical to your development as a human.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.180]   It is when you are alone with your own thoughts
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.820]   in the state that is known as solitude,
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820]   that you can actually take those experiences
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.980]   you're having in your life and fit them into a framework,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.480]   a common framework by which you understand your experience.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   It's where you can reflect on yourself,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.400]   what's going well, what's not going well,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.980]   what's resonating with you,
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.560]   what you're worried about in your life,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.200]   and make progress in your identity, in your self-definition.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   It is in this time alone with our mind
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.880]   that we evolve as humans.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.120]   And if you rob yourself of that solitude
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.620]   by always looking at that shiny, highly distracting treat
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.680]   sitting there in your pocket
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.340]   represented by the apps on that phone,
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.780]   you miss out on that solitude.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.540]   The other advantage of the boredom you will encounter
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.060]   not having these apps on your phone
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.640]   is that it will push you to do
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.560]   higher quality leisure activities.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.380]   You're sitting there, it's the afternoon,
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.400]   you don't have anything to look at,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.540]   you don't have anything to watch.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.380]   This might drive you to read,
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.980]   the exercise to pick up that new hobby,
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.920]   to go for the walk,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.780]   to go join some sort of organization and club.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140]   Boredom is a very useful instinct.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.100]   Typically when it comes to human nature,
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.940]   whenever there's a very strong or disagreeable feeling
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.660]   that is pushing us to do something that is important to us,
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.140]   we feel hunger, it feels terrible.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.360]   Why? Because it's important that we eat.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.180]   So what is boredom, which feels very bad,
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.600]   pushing us to do productive activity?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.420]   The phone interrupts that push, the productive activity.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.500]   It short circuits that instinct
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.380]   and gets you just looking at that glowing piece of glass.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.620]   But without the phone there,
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.580]   you can actually feel through that boredom instinct
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.580]   to go do things that are actually productive,
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.220]   stuff that's good for you, for your soul,
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.620]   for your family, for your community.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.300]   Your leisure will get better
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   when you can't default to the quick fix
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.240]   of tapping on social media.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.620]   So more productive boredom,
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.340]   that is one of the perks of not using social media.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.520]   Another one, lower anxiety.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.940]   Your world is what you pay attention to.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.100]   There's way more information out there possible to consume
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.580]   than you can ever possibly actually take in.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.940]   So your mind looks at what you have consumes
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.540]   and tries to construct
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.820]   an understanding of the world around you,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.500]   not just a physical or visual understanding,
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.260]   but also an emotional understanding of the world as well.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.180]   If you are living in the world of social media,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.260]   especially on a highly combative platform like Twitter,
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.300]   the image of the world that your mind will construct
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.060]   is one of terrifying, almost unbearable strife.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.980]   It is a world in which villains ride freely
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.780]   through the virtual town square
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.760]   and the townspeople fire at them with their revolvers.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.820]   People dropping dead
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.140]   from this metaphorical virtual saloon window.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.340]   It is a scary world.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.180]   This is an upsetting world.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.860]   It is a world of outrage.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.480]   It is a world in which people are castigated
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.500]   at a moment's notice and criminals must be rooted out.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.060]   It is not a happy world.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.900]   Have you ever met, for example,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.920]   a frequent Twitter user who was happy?
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.900]   No, why?
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.660]   Because the world that exposes your mind to
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.500]   is not a nice one.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.700]   So if you spend a lot of time on social media,
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.460]   you're gonna be living in a world of your own construction
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.560]   that is not going to be an environment to thrive.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   Now you might say, "Well, why don't I avoid Twitter?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.920]   I'll go, I'm over on Instagram.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.200]   I don't wanna see the political stuff.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.320]   I don't wanna see the fighting."
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.440]   Well, what are you gonna get on Instagram?
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.600]   Highly curated portrayals of people's lives.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   Everyone's happy.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.720]   Everyone's in great shape.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Everyone is doing more interesting things to you.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.360]   That's a world where you feel inferior.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.980]   The worlds created, again,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.240]   when you're marinating yourself
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   in these social media worlds are not good ones.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.940]   So you're gonna be more anxious.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.880]   You're gonna be less happy.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.940]   When you don't have social media on your phone,
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.040]   when you don't have it on your computer,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.520]   when you do not expose yourself to that weird,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.960]   unnatural, highly curated,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.880]   algorithmically optimized type of information,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.260]   the world you see is actually
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.240]   much more the world around you.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.640]   Your friends, the people in town,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.300]   what you're reading in books,
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.500]   what you hear on the radio,
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.020]   what you saw on your walk home.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.720]   It is a world that is calibrated to the human mind.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.040]   It's the experience that we actually are expecting.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.980]   It's a calmer world.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.780]   It's a less anxiety producing world.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.200]   It's a slower world.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.960]   And all of that is much better.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   All of that is much more sustainable.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.240]   That's the second perk.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.280]   Third perk, privacy.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.820]   If you're on these platforms all the time,
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.960]   you have to be generating content all the time.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.480]   This content is going to reveal over time
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.840]   more than you probably want to actually reveal.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.880]   It is a very unsettling position to be in as a human
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.120]   to know that there is an amorphous large crowd
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   of people you mainly don't know who know a lot about you.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.060]   And you don't even know how much it is
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.800]   that they know about you.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.200]   It's very unsettling.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.120]   If I was on social media as an author,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.200]   if I had to be tweeting and doing Instagram
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.300]   and doing these types of things all the time, every day,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.800]   post, post, post, post, post,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.040]   I would end up revealing a lot more about myself
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   than I want people to know.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.760]   I'm actually a very private person.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.520]   Yes, it sounds paradoxical
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.920]   because I'm in the public eye a lot.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.240]   You're watching me on a video.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.360]   You may have seen me on TV.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.680]   You may have seen me on other people's podcasts
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.960]   or radio shows, but that is a very controlled environment.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   This is me sitting down and maybe producing one video
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.280]   that I want you to see that I spent just today working on.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   That's much different than having to throughout the day
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.560]   be, what do I think about this?
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.400]   What do I think about that?
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.000]   Giving takes on things, reacting to things,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.560]   having back and forth conversations.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.600]   That reveals too much.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.840]   Happy to go on a radio show,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.500]   happy to write an article and put it out there.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.000]   Happy to think through a video and have notes on it
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.920]   and record that, fine.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.360]   But if I have to go back and forth all day,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   give my reaction on everything, I'm gonna reveal too much.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.120]   And I don't wanna give up that much of myself.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.480]   And you shouldn't either.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.440]   It is not natural.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.920]   Human beings are wired to have
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.400]   relatively tight-knit communities
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.560]   where people know them well,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.440]   through bounds of family
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.080]   or other types of community connection.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.200]   You trust each other.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.080]   They have your back.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.520]   You have their back.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.360]   They see your bad.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.180]   They see your good.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.020]   They see you at your best.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.040]   They see you at your worst,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.120]   but everyone trusts each other.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.200]   Everyone's willing to sacrifice on behalf of each other
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.920]   in these small, close-knit communities.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.880]   That is the socialization we're wired for.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.680]   Not there's 10,000 amorphous people here
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.000]   looking at my back and forth conversations on Twitter
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.800]   trying to figure out when to pounce.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.440]   So we do not need to be that open to that many people.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   It doesn't match our wiring.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.280]   It can make us pretty unsettled.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.360]   So you don't use social media,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.600]   you don't have to worry about that.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.020]   All right, number four,
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.320]   the fourth perk of not using social media,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.340]   lower your sense of self-importance.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.200]   This is one of the insidious side effects of social media
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.180]   is the degree to which it makes you feel
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.400]   as if at all times there is this vast audience
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.080]   that really cares what you have to say.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.900]   And you get this because of the little metrics.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.120]   You get the little thumbs up,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.080]   you get the little hearts,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.720]   there's little numbers on next to it
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.280]   that begin to tabulate up.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.200]   This was retweeted.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.320]   This was liked.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.480]   This was shared.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.020]   Some of these platforms will even do this
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.420]   in a blatantly manipulative manner.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.060]   TikTok is known for example,
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.180]   to take your videos occasionally
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.620]   and show them to a much larger audience than normal
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.060]   just so you get that intermittently reinforcing burst of,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.280]   woo, a lot of people like this one.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.300]   So that you're gonna keep pulling
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.460]   that slot machine lever again
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.300]   to hopefully get that next burst before.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.980]   All of this gives you a sense of
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.700]   everyone cares what I have to say.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.080]   It inflates your ego.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.120]   It leads you to entrench,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   to glom on to weird ideas or conspiratorial thinking
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.980]   to begin to other the people who disagree with you
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.240]   or in the other tribe.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960]   You feel like you are at the center
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.780]   of some sort of apocalyptic life and death battle.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.560]   All of this is the human psyche
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.720]   being manipulated by these services.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   It is not good for us to be given daily this sense,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.360]   this inflated sense of self-importance.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.760]   You know, back when I wrote my book, "Deep Work",
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   I had this advice that I gave to people
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.020]   who were active on social media.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.040]   I said, "Step away for 30 days,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.980]   but here's the key caveat, don't tell anybody.
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.640]   Step away from 30 days, don't tell anybody
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.540]   and see if anyone notices."
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.240]   And a lot of people wrote back to me
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.320]   after that book came out and said,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.420]   "That was momentarily devastating
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.320]   because I realized in my mind,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.620]   'cause I see all these thumbs up,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.040]   I see all these numbers, all these likes,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.640]   all these retweets, I thought that there was
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.020]   this vast audience that was waiting with bated breath
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.560]   for my next missive.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.440]   When I stopped posting for a month, no one noticed.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.620]   No one said anything, no one cared
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.680]   because the platforms create the illusion of influence,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.080]   the illusion of importance,
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.600]   and we should not be bathing in that context.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.480]   Again, it pushes us to weird places.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.360]   It's better for our sense of importance
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.300]   to come from the actual things we're doing
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.440]   in the real world with flesh and blood other humans.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.720]   I have the respect of this person
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.840]   because over time I had been there when they needed me.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.880]   I have the respect of these people over here
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.600]   because they've seen my work, they respect it,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.460]   they've read it, I've talked to them, I know them well.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.680]   I have the respect of my family
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.440]   because I've been trying to be a leader,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.280]   a leader trying to be there for them,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.760]   sacrifice on behalf of them."
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.120]   You get a calibrated sense of importance
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.840]   which pushes you to actually do things of real importance
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.480]   to live a more sustainable, deeper life.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.760]   All of that, again, gets subverted and short-circuited
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.780]   when you allow these little manipulated metrics,
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.600]   these little numbers next to icons on an app on your phone,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.400]   tell you whether you're influential or not,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.920]   tell you whether you're important or not.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.120]   You don't want that inflated sense of importance.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.880]   You want a real sense of importance
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.420]   made from doing real things
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.800]   on behalf of real people that really matters.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.600]   All right, so those are my four perks
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.280]   that I think almost anyone will benefit
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.980]   if they do not use social media,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.360]   or at the very least,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.080]   significantly reduce their footprint on those platforms.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.600]   So just to review what we have here,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.240]   you will be bored more often,
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.480]   but that boredom will lead to good things.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.880]   Your anxiety will be lower
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.680]   because the world constructed by your mind
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.420]   is constructed from what you pay attention to.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.600]   If you're paying attention to social media,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.520]   that is gonna be a grim, unsettling world.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   You will have more privacy.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.360]   Human beings are not wired
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.980]   to have amorphous large crowds of strangers
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.560]   watching you react to news
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.080]   and have interactions back and forth
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.280]   with other heated strangers.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.360]   And finally, it will lower your sense of self-importance.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.120]   It will push you to seek sense of importance
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.600]   in real ways and tangible ways,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.800]   and that's ultimately better for you.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   It's better for your family.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.600]   It's better for your community.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.400]   So if like a lot of people,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.280]   you're not super happy about what's happening
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.120]   on social media,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.600]   if you're not super happy about the influence
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.920]   that social media is having on your life,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.640]   if you're thinking about stepping away,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.240]   let me tell you as someone who has done this,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.320]   it's worth it.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   If you don't like what's going on there, go.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.720]   The benefits of leaving
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.240]   might be much bigger than you at first guess.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.740]   (upbeat music)
