[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.920]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.080]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.000]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.460]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.680]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.080]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.920]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.860]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.280]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.680]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.280]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.100]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.440]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.360]   to this episode of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.100]   I know that a lot of you, like me,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   you either are taking or you have taken a break
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.800]   from working on your passions
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   in order to homeschool in your family.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   And a lot of times, let's be frank,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.720]   where I am when kids grow up,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.560]   we go back or we go forward
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   to something that we want to work in.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.620]   I host podcasts and I write curriculum.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.620]   I have as my guest today a homeschool mom who makes movies.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.920]   So I want you to welcome to the podcast with me,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.620]   Sam Sorbo today.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.120]   Sam, thanks so much for being with us.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.780]   - Yeah, thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.740]   It's always fun to talk to fellow homeschoolers
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.000]   and get their perspectives on various things.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.560]   So I'm looking forward to this.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.060]   - This is gonna be really fun to get different perspectives
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.720]   from people we don't rub shoulders with every day.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.900]   I wanna give you a chance to introduce yourself
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.980]   to all these new friends that you're gonna make today.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.660]   Tell them who you are,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.080]   maybe a little bit about your family.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.740]   I have lots of questions to ask you about homeschooling
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.100]   and your family's experience.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.220]   But I also have a movie, you might've heard of it,
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.240]   "Miracle in East Texas" that I wanna ask you about too.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220]   So give us a thumbnail sketch of your Sam Sorbo life.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.980]   - You're so funny.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.580]   Of course I've heard of my movie.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.060]   (both laughing)
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.960]   So I was born at a very young age.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.420]   I'm kidding, okay.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.000]   Well, most of us were.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   - Fast forward to, I met my husband
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   and he had a severe health crisis right in front of me.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.040]   And I was forced to make really a binary choice.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.160]   I chose to walk away from my career
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.200]   because I wanted him to be healthy and I wanted a family.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.160]   And I recognized that that was the choice
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.520]   that God had put in front of me.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   And I was very blessed to understand that very quickly.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.740]   And so a lot of what I do when I talk to moms especially,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.860]   but really young women anywhere,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.880]   is I tell them that every choice is binary.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.840]   There's only the up or the down, there's the on or the off.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   And when you try to sit on the fence, it doesn't serve you.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.040]   You need to prioritize and then serve the highest priority
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.760]   with that decision.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.120]   So I made that decision with Kevin.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.500]   We got married, he did recover fully.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.000]   It took about three years, it was a hard road.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.720]   And then we had children.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.360]   And I had three children and I was getting back
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.460]   to my career, which was as an actress.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.600]   And I had my toddler, my youngest,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.200]   who didn't have very many words,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.780]   but she did have the word no,
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.640]   run up to me when I came home from an audition one day
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.020]   with her little finger pointing saying,
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.100]   "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.200]   And I picked her up and I put her on my hip
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.280]   and she turned to my nanny and she said, "Bye-bye."
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.440]   - Oh.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.540]   - And so because of my previous experience,
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.480]   I recognized that I had another binary choice
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.320]   in front of me.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.160]   And I want to get parents to recognize that.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.360]   You must prioritize your children, they are worth it.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.800]   And when you do that, you win.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.120]   It's not them who wins. - Absolutely.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.800]   - Like they win, sure, they win, absolutely.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   But you win to a degree that you can't possibly fathom
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.200]   because of our culture today.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.320]   Because our culture says that children have no value.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   They actually, their death has more value than their lives
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.280]   in our culture today.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.520]   It's so upside down.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.480]   And so I try to speak into culture.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'm very blessed that I have a platform
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.840]   because of the fame of my husband, really.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.200]   And so that gets me in places
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.720]   and gets me in front of people and stuff
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.180]   that otherwise I wouldn't.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.240]   But even if he didn't have that,
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.320]   I would be just trying to get this message out
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.900]   because this is the saving message of the United States.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.260]   I believe this is the message that can save freedom
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.680]   if we can get enough families, Christian families
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   to homeschool for Christian children.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.000]   And the reason that I say that is it's pretty simple.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.160]   Children love truth right now in our schools.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.520]   And I'll say our nation's schools,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.600]   I will just focus on government schools for right now.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.060]   They're getting a pack of lies.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.280]   They hate it, they're rebellious.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.020]   They know that they're being lied to.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.160]   And they are doing everything in their power
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.100]   to stick it to the man, to rebel against that.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.000]   But if you do so little, so little in your homeschool,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.900]   this little, okay, read the Bible with your kids every day.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.760]   15 to 20 minutes.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.040]   I'm not talking, this is not a big lift.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.900]   This is the least amount of work that you could do
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.140]   and still be able to say that you are being successful.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.400]   It's literally this simple.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.620]   Read the Bible with your kids every day.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.920]   Make them understand that the Bible is truth
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.480]   and don't give them electronics.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.540]   That's the other caveat.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.140]   They can't have electronics, seriously, no electronics.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.000]   Like maybe one movie a week
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   if you screen the movie for them kind of thing.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.060]   Then your children will grow up loving truth and loving God.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.360]   It's literally, and like I know I'm talking
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.160]   on a classical conversations platform, right?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.800]   So I'm not dissing classical conversations in any way.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.920]   I'm a full-time classical conversations mom.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.120]   I'm a big advocate.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.080]   I speak and I advocate for classical conversations
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.680]   and they don't pay me.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.080]   - Yes. (laughs)
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.440]   Well, you are with kindred spirits then.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.760]   Here we all are together in that.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.320]   - But I've heard, I have heard from parents
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.880]   that and they, and by the way, it isn't,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.640]   but they think that it's too heavy of a lift.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.960]   - Oh, yes, right.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.540]   - Because it appears like, oh my goodness, that's a lot.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.640]   And it can be a lot if you choose for it to be a lot,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.760]   but it doesn't have to be.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.840]   It's fully, you can tailor it fully.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.120]   So I'm not sure, but here's the thing.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.760]   Have you noticed, Lisa?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.480]   People say a lot of stuff
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.560]   about things that they know nothing about.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.800]   - And they have little experience with.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.120]   - Well, yeah, 'cause they know nothing.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.900]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.740]   - They know nothing.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.520]   I was at an event two nights ago
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.640]   and I was talking with a,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.400]   he's actually a very well-known talk show host
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.100]   and God bless him.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.160]   He's for school choice and he has a school
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.920]   that he supports and blah, blah, blah, right?
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   - Right, right.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.760]   - And he goes, but Sam, parents can't,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.360]   you can't think that parents are all gonna, you know.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.340]   And I said, with all due respect,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.160]   and I'll shortcut it for you 'cause I'm never this rude,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.960]   but because you and I are talking, I'll just shortcut it.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.800]   - Right.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.600]   - I'm like, you just don't know what you're talking about.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.440]   You don't have kids.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.800]   You've never educated a child.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.920]   Like, you just don't know.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.320]   - You haven't tried it.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.540]   - You're making statements,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.280]   but you really don't know what you're saying
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.440]   because you're using the word homeschool,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.520]   but you don't even have a,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   you have no idea what homeschooling is.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.360]   - Right.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   - I mean, that's really like,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.060]   not every parent can homeschool.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.400]   Not the way you do it.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.600]   How do you homeschool again?
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.680]   Can you explain that to me again?
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.840]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.240]   - Because they don't.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.960]   - Right, they are envisioning bringing home
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.680]   what they knew of education when they were students.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.520]   - That's right.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.420]   - And it's not that.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.240]   - It's not, this is what I say.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.680]   I don't even call it homeschooling
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.320]   because it's not school at home.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.160]   That's not what it is.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.280]   Oh my goodness, it's home-centered education.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.780]   That's what we do.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.680]   But people don't understand that.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.520]   Well.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   - I like that, home-centered, home-seated.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.840]   Home-seated education because it's not centered on the home.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.320]   It's just seated there.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.200]   - Exactly, a lot of people think,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.920]   oh, homeschoolers, they're so odd.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.320]   They never leave their home
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.760]   and everything has to be controlled by their parent.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   It's all inside the four walls of their home.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.880]   And that's rare.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.420]   In most cases, we are out.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.560]   We are doing things.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.260]   We are availing ourselves of opportunities.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.040]   Home-seated or home-centered, yes.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.160]   But school at home, that's the worst.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.840]   - Well, school schooling's the worst.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.680]   - Well, that's true.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.680]   I give you that.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.520]   I give you that.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.560]   - But there's an explanation for why people think
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.760]   that homeschoolers are weirdos.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.120]   And we should excuse them for that
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.920]   'cause they just don't know.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.620]   - Right, they probably not met any real homeschoolers.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.900]   - And you've been doing this for a while, right?
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.560]   So you remember probably when homeschoolers
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.560]   were all weird, they were all weirdos.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.680]   Like, a lot of them were weirdos.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.140]   - Okay, I will tell you.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.680]   I'll tell you, my 30-year-old daughter,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.600]   she's 30 now, or she's, actually, she turns 30 tomorrow.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.400]   When she was young, we homeschooled her the whole way,
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   she would describe people that she met in the early days.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.720]   She would find out that they went to public school
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.860]   or they went to private school or they were homeschooled.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.040]   And then she would look at me
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.540]   and she would tip her head down and she would say,
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.580]   but they are painfully homeschooled.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.720]   And she meant they were awkward.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.040]   They were socially awkward.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.480]   - Right, but that's because back in the day,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.880]   and we'll go back, let's go back 40 years, right?
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.260]   Before you started.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.680]   Back then, you were a pioneer when you chose
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.600]   to not avail yourself of the government schools.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.340]   Either you were extremely religious,
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.400]   which comes with its own things,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.840]   which we don't have to get into, right?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   Or your child was so much of a misfit,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.560]   they couldn't get along.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.460]   And so it was your last resort.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.460]   It was your only resort was to keep them out of the bullying
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.080]   and the mistreatment that the school would provide
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.880]   because your child was so misaligned
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   with whatever social cues were happening in the school.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.980]   And so they were weirdos when they were homeschooled.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.980]   But those days have changed, man.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.100]   And now if you're homeschooled, you're part of the cool kids
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.420]   because it's the misfits that go to school.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.640]   It's the kids who think that they can defecate
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.700]   in a litter box because they believe themselves to be cats.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.060]   And I'm sure you've seen the meme.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.260]   There are several of them, but it's like,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.540]   why do you homeschool your kids?
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.980]   Your kids are gonna be weirdos.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.260]   And then the next frame is,
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.040]   yeah, your kid goes to school and thinks that he's a cat.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.440]   - Right, exactly, exactly.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.620]   That is very true.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.620]   And now I had a friend just the other day who said
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.780]   that she was out with her children.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.860]   And when somebody found out
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.180]   that her children were homeschooled,
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.060]   they said, really, they're homeschooled?
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.660]   They're so normal.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.900]   And what she meant by that was
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.140]   they act like regular teenagers
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.980]   and they are able to converse,
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.780]   which actually in point of fact is not normal
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.660]   for a lot of teenagers who are used to only interacting
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.140]   with people their own age.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.660]   - Well, they say, well,
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.900]   how are your kids gonna get socialized in school?
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.380]   And I go, but in school,
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.040]   they're taught that they have to sit at the desk
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.940]   and shut up and not talk to people.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.540]   Where do you think they're getting socialized?
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.360]   And define socialized, like, what do you mean by that?
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.900]   Mobs don't socialize people.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.020]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.980]   And by the way, I socialize my dog.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.620]   I don't socialize my children.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.460]   - Yes, I raise my children.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.500]   - Yeah, and there's so many different ways
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.940]   of sort of combating that.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.220]   But like I said, people say things
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.140]   about things about which they know nothing.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.540]   - Yes, you're right.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.980]   You are very right.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.020]   Let me ask you this.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.160]   What did you always grow up thinking,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.620]   oh, when I have children, I'm going to homeschool them.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.620]   What convinced you that families need to be emancipated
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.460]   from the modern school system?
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.980]   What is it that is so wrong with that system?
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.220]   What is it giving us that we don't need?
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.580]   And what is it keeping from us that we do need?
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.780]   - Oh, I thought you only wanted to go an hour.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.740]   - Well, here's the deal.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.620]   If we get too much, we'll just break it into two
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.040]   and have a two-part episode.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.340]   - That's a deal.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.140]   Okay, so here's the thing.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.900]   I, my son, my oldest son, we moved for the school.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.000]   We moved to get to a better school system.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.540]   And this cute little red brick elementary school
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.140]   that was so well appointed
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.340]   and it was so sweet and everything.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.360]   And so he went to first and second grade.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.420]   And in second grade, there was stuff happening
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.020]   in the classroom that I disliked.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.780]   He was coming home with an attitude that I didn't enjoy.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.060]   He was only in second grade,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.720]   but he was a very, very popular child.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.500]   He was, in first grade, all the fifth graders,
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.280]   that was the highest grade in that school,
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.260]   they all knew his name.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.100]   He was a known entity by the end of first grade.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.100]   And so I just, and then there were some issues
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.060]   with the teachers.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.940]   I loved the teacher.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.540]   She was a really sweet gal, but he had two teachers.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.300]   They alternated every day.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.540]   They had five disruptive children in the class,
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.100]   five of them.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.700]   It took her ages to get them EIPs.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.220]   There were just a bunch of different things.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.100]   And in fact, I wrote about them in my book there, Your Kids,
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.700]   because I wanted people to understand the journey
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.880]   that I went on to get to the point where I said
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.420]   to my husband at the end of second grade,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.440]   I think I could fail at homeschooling
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.820]   and he would still be better off.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.420]   - And do better.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.500]   - Yeah, it was so evident to me.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.260]   And that's why I say, to boil it down,
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.540]   all you really need to do is 15 minutes of Bible
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.100]   every day with your child.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.820]   Teach them to read, teach them manners.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.980]   - Have conversations with them about what they're thinking.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.060]   - We're really talking the basics.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.140]   And so going back to this conversation that I had
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.140]   with this talk show host, I said, here's the thing.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.180]   Children are naturally curious.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.860]   What's the first thing we tell them they have to do
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.700]   when they go to school?
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.100]   Sit down and shut up. - Sit down and stop.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.580]   - Stop asking questions.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.780]   So school is the opposite of education.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.640]   And he turns to me, he goes, "Sam, you just blew my mind."
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.020]   I go, "Yeah, because nobody thinks that way."
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.860]   Why?
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.580]   Because we all went to school, okay?
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.640]   We are all so school injured.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.620]   We are school injured. - Yes, yes.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.700]   - Even now as parents.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.780]   And so I took him out after second grade.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.700]   I sent my two youngers to the lovely little kindergarten
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.460]   'cause I thought, what's the harm?
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.220]   - Right, and them playing with other kids, right.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.660]   - And I thought, they'll make friends.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.980]   This will be a good thing for them.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.500]   And I've got a story about that.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.140]   So I don't recommend preschool anymore.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.580]   I don't recommend kindergarten.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.080]   I recommend no institutionalizing a healthy child.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   Do not institutionalize your healthy children.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.340]   It's that simple.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.840]   But I'll save that story for a minute
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   because I took my oldest out and all of a sudden,
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.340]   over the course of say, two or three weeks,
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.140]   I noticed, gee, they're getting along so much better now.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.980]   - Yes.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.640]   - The shift was immediate.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.620]   It happened very quickly.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.720]   And then I started like doing some schoolwork with them.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.460]   And it was fun.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.320]   Now I get it, I'm a bit of a nerd.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.580]   I like the schoolwork.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.100]   Like it was fun to me.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.320]   - Well, you're talking to nerds.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.020]   So we're all in that together.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.780]   - But I liked doing stuff with my kids.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.540]   And so if you, so, and like I said,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.060]   these stories are in the book, "They're Your Kids,"
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.060]   which really, I wrote it because I started to blog.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.000]   My experience as a homeschooler,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.180]   I thought if I'm gonna do this experiment,
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.180]   I might as well share it with other people.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.820]   So I started to blog and then eventually
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.820]   I put it all together in a book.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.940]   And the first part of the book is the entire indictment
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.960]   of our school system,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.640]   which goes into the history of the school system
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.300]   and why it is anti-American, it's anti-constitutional.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.340]   Even though it's in state constitutions,
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.140]   it's not in the national constitution.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.180]   So I don't know why we have a Department of Education.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.820]   In fact, we should call it the Department of Schooling
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.820]   because it's not an education center.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.940]   - And that was never a national important,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.640]   that was not one of the founding father's ideas
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.500]   for what the federal government should be responsible for.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.940]   - No, they would be rolling over in their graves.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.420]   And by the way, let's point out, they were geniuses, right?
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.780]   They created, out of whole cloth,
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.620]   they created and then fought for and won the right to be
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.580]   the most prosperous nation in the world,
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.100]   sorry, the most prosperous nation in the world,
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.100]   which created the greatest leap in prosperity for the world,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.780]   the greatest, most generous nation in the world,
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.620]   was created by these geniuses who,
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.620]   can I just point out, were all homeschooled.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.160]   - I was gonna say, who or shall we note
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.900]   were not publicly educated?
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.740]   - Right.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.100]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.460]   - So I started doing this with the kids.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.020]   And so fast forward, my kids are all fierce,
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.980]   fiercely dipped in truth.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.980]   Like they are truth seekers, they love God,
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.220]   they have very strong opinions.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.980]   I say that to people and they look at me like,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.920]   "Well, we wonder where they got that, Sam."
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.300]   And I'm like, "Because," and I tell parents,
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.600]   "Negotiate with your children,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.920]   "teach your children to negotiate,
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.460]   "teach your children to debate."
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.300]   - Yes.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.140]   - And this is why people can come to me and say things
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.700]   that they don't know anything about
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.340]   as if they have knowledge because they were never taught
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.020]   in school what actual knowledge is.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.700]   They were given pablum and told that they were smart.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.520]   They regurgitated the teacher's opinions on a test
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.580]   and they were given an A.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.380]   And so they think they're knowledgeable
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.180]   about things that they're not knowledgeable.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.700]   I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.760]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.540]   - So fast forward, my kids, I say this out loud
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.420]   when I speak and I talk to legislators, I talk to moms,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.300]   I speak all over the country and I say to people,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.340]   "I did it wrong."
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.220]   - Oh, yes. - I didn't even do it right.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.260]   - Right.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.340]   - And it was hugely, phenomenally successful.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.140]   You meet my kids and you're like, "How'd that happen?
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.260]   "Where'd that come from?"
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.360]   Because my, and they're all extraordinarily different.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.620]   My oldest is the social butterfly.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.500]   He knows a ton of people everywhere.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.900]   I go speak at a conference and the guy sitting next to me
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.000]   at the conference, I get home and I tell my son,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.680]   so I went and spoke at this conference and he goes,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.460]   "Yeah, I know, my friend was sitting next to you."
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.120]   I'm like, "So you knew people at the conference
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.780]   "that I didn't know."
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.020]   - Right, right.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.300]   I know a guy. - How does that happen?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.780]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.740]   You're just so-and-so's mom to some people.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.220]   - But I can't brag too much about my kids, can I?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.060]   I mean-- - Oh, sure, sure.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.940]   And you can tell embarrassing stories about them.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.460]   I'm sure they'll never listen to this interview, so.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.020]   - So let me, so we're talking the everyday educator, right?
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.420]   And we're talking to moms who are educators,
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.460]   or at least they're trying to be.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.940]   Here's the thing, you are the curriculum.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.300]   Don't make it more complicated than that.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   If you wanna go get books to teach your kids stuff, okay.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.140]   But here's the deal, your kids are curious.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.940]   If you just guide that curiosity
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.800]   and then put some guard rails on it
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.140]   so it doesn't go off the charts in any one direction, right,
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.180]   they will drive their own education.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.820]   Oh, you better hold on, you know.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.980]   Like, let them drive their education, you hold on.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.140]   And do your kids need to learn Latin?
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.440]   I think that they should learn Latin.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.460]   That's a tough one, right,
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.440]   because they're gonna argue with you.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.300]   But here's the deal, there are no arguments about Latin.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.460]   Latin is a pre-decided thing.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.940]   There's no point in bringing it up.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.780]   It's going to happen.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.320]   You will learn Latin. - Right, we're doing it.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.140]   - Right, we're gonna do it. - And we're doing it together.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.940]   So smile and nod. - That's right.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.980]   That's right, same thing with piano.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.780]   My kids, all of my kids at one point or another
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.020]   begged me to drop piano.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.420]   Oh, we'll take up guitar as if that's like, come on.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.980]   I know what's happening there.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.060]   So yes, you can certainly take up guitar.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.500]   It's a perfect accompaniment for piano.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.500]   And so you can learn both simultaneously,
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.860]   and that's a very clever idea.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.180]   And guess what, the guitar never happened,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.920]   but my kids all play piano, and I have one child.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.980]   The other two, they're proficient pianists.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.780]   They're good, right?
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.740]   They are not in love with it.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.400]   But I do have a child who absolutely loves it.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.520]   He's traveling in Europe right now,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.540]   and he reached out to me because there is
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.980]   a fold-up keyboard that he wants to get himself.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.500]   - Oh, lovely.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.060]   - That's how much he loves it.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.260]   That's how much he needs it.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.060]   - And see, how would he have found that passion
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.120]   if you had not pressed and introduced that to him?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.960]   - That's right.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.780]   - So that's what we do.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.660]   We're the great introducers of all the things
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.060]   so that our children can become proficient in some
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.820]   and passionate about others, but well-rounded
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.740]   and able to participate in all kinds of conversations.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.780]   I had one daughter who absolutely would have been happy
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.300]   if I had let her skip all the debate
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.180]   that she was ever assigned to do.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.920]   And she would come home and she would say,
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   "I've already done one.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.400]   "Are you sure that I have to participate in this one?"
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.580]   And I was like, "Yeah, I'm sure that you do."
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.620]   And you were sure that you had to when you asked me that.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.540]   And she never let the record show.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.400]   She never developed a passion for it.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.900]   But the funniest, one of the funniest stories
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.020]   of our homeschooling journey was that when she went
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:23.020]   to college and got assigned to debate with a team
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.220]   in an art class, of all things,
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.440]   nobody else in the class had any idea about debate.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.420]   And she is not a natural leader and does not want
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.340]   to be in charge, but will fill the space if no one,
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.180]   if a leader does not appear, she will do it.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.140]   And so she said, "Well, I mean, we have to do this debate.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.760]   "We need a statement, we need our affirmations,
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.820]   "we need three reasons, we need to have some research
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.460]   "so that we're prepared to rebut."
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.500]   And they were all like, "What in the world?"
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.940]   And so she led her team through this.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.580]   And as she exited the classroom, the professor said,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.940]   "Well, I can tell that you must have been a big debater
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.180]   "in high school because you know how to do this so well."
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.700]   And she was so flabbergasted.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.660]   She didn't do anything but shake his hand as she exited.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.500]   (laughing)
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.180]   And she came home and she called me and she said,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.740]   "Oh, my word, what have you done?"
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.260]   I said, "Absolutely nothing, but look what God
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.820]   "has done through you."
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:30.140]   - The point of debate is not to get proficient at debate.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.000]   - Right.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.280]   - The point of debate is to learn how to think and reason.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.480]   - And listen.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   - And, right, and listen so that you, and by the way,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.120]   hear the other side of things, be able to see
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.740]   the other side of things because one day you will need
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.300]   to persuade somebody of something.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.780]   And if you know how to debate, then you will be able
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.340]   better to persuade them of the thing that you want
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.820]   to persuade them of.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.660]   - That's so true.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.020]   - It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.620]   - If you're not able to listen to the other person,
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.740]   then you're never able to dial back to where you both
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.860]   agreed on something.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.500]   And in order to ever persuade someone of anything,
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.060]   you have to find the last point of commonality,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.140]   the last point of agreement, and then we're gonna
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.220]   walk forward, and I am hopefully going to lead you
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.060]   toward my position.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.180]   - So you wanna know the hardest thing that I've ever done
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.100]   as a homeschool mom?
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.280]   - What?
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.120]   - Debate.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.580]   So I personally love debate.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.940]   I never did it growing up, I had no idea,
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.620]   but I learned everything that I ever needed to know
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.620]   about debate by stoa, which is the Greek word for column,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.220]   and it's a debate organization, a Christian debate
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.460]   organization, speech and debate, out on the West Coast
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.500]   when we lived on the West Coast.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.000]   So I learned everything there and through, obviously,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.900]   through classical conversations, but my son loved it.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.460]   He loved giving speeches and he became quite well known
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.100]   because that's what he does.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.700]   He gets himself to be well known in those circles.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.980]   My second child preferred Lincoln Douglas,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.420]   and so he did a bunch of Lincoln Douglas.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.580]   And then my third child was too young out there, we moved,
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.280]   and so she did debate here in Florida.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.420]   And for her first debate in challenge one,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.620]   she was debating the death penalty and she's very,
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.380]   I don't know if shy is the correct word.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.220]   She's an extreme introvert and she did not want to debate.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.060]   And so on the day of the debate,
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.020]   she stood in the hallway and sobbed.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.980]   - Oh, yes. - I kid you not, she sobbed.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.740]   - Yes. - And sobbed some more.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.380]   Please don't make me do this, mommy.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.740]   Please don't make me do this.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.060]   I just don't want to do it.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.900]   I just can't do it.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.840]   Now, I had arranged, because I pulled some strings
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.140]   and nobody minded, for her to give the one AC,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.340]   which is the first part of the debate.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.180]   - Absolutely. - And it is fully scripted.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.740]   The only not scripted part is your cross-examination.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.140]   - Exactly. - In which you're
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.640]   answering questions, right?
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.340]   And it's the first debate, so like all bets are off
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.020]   as to how it's gonna go. - Right, right.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.840]   They're just gonna ask you where you get your sources, so.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.660]   - Right, she was in, could you repeat your first point
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.500]   or whatever? - Right, right.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   - She was in a pretty academic class and she was terrified.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.360]   And she, it took her forever, I kid you not.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.020]   The whole room was silent and we were jam-packed
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.540]   into a small classroom with all the parents there
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.380]   to watch and support and whatever.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.100]   And it was stifling and nobody said a thing.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.640]   And I talked her through it, I'm gonna get emotional
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.740]   because it was very hard for me to do this.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.220]   - Yes, yes. - And I just kept saying
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.940]   to her, you must, you will read it, you will read it now.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.580]   - That you're going to stand up there and get through it.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.020]   - That's correct, and she walked up to the podium
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.560]   and she was crying and she turned around and walked away
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.820]   and then she walked back and cried some more
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.180]   and turned around and walked away.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.880]   I kid you not, it was agonizing.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.120]   And I finally said, I'm gonna count you down.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.020]   This is a trick that I shall share with parents.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.940]   You don't count up, you count down.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.180]   And so I said, I'm gonna count you down, here we go.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.680]   Stand at the podium, three, two, one.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.120]   And I will tell you, I didn't shed a tear at the time.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.820]   I'm emotional now, but at the time I was fully stoic.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.160]   I was not going to let up.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.140]   - Well, she had to conquer it.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.540]   She had to win that day in that moment.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.540]   - That's it, or she would never win.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.260]   - Right, exactly. - Or would never have, right?
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.100]   And she sobbed through the entire thing.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.680]   She got three quarters of the way through
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.640]   and she sort of let up a little bit
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.000]   because I think she was three quarters of the way through,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.940]   but then she realized that she was almost done
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.760]   and she broke down again and sobbed for the rest of it.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.340]   (laughs)
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.820]   But here's the thing, and this is what I wanna tell parents
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.860]   because you have to learn from this, okay?
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.980]   This was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.380]   I'm so glad I did it.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.780]   She's so glad I did it.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.700]   And the next week, because we had a small class,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.460]   the director decided that we would debate
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.100]   the opposite side the following week.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.520]   And so each team took the opposite side.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.940]   And that week we were in the great big room,
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.300]   'cause we got the great big room that day,
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   and my daughter totally ruled the room.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.180]   (laughs)
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.600]   - Good for her.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.820]   - It was night and day.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.220]   - Yeah.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.700]   - And it's only because she powered through and she won.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.620]   - Yes, yes.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.900]   And only because you as her mother
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.100]   loved her enough to do the hard,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.980]   uncomfortable thing and stand and walk with her
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.460]   through the terribly uncomfortable experience
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.500]   so she could get to the other side and be victorious.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.560]   Because you cared enough about her to do that
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.220]   more than anybody else would have cared about her.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.180]   - It's so hard, I'm seriously crying right now
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.020]   because it was so, it really was very hard.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.820]   I just, yeah.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.940]   - Yeah, and that's what homeschooling is all about.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.420]   Helping your children do the hard things
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   and walking hand in hand with them through the hard things
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:52.580]   till they become confident that--
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.940]   - Till they can lead the way.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.060]   - Yes.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.100]   - And it's such a, so this is what they hide from us, right?
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.020]   When you send your child to school,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.180]   they don't let you see this side of the equation,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.740]   like this potential, right?
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.580]   - Right.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.140]   - My relationship with my teenagers,
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.600]   I tell parents, teenagers don't rebel.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.040]   Because there are certain lies that we have simply adopted
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.660]   and accepted in our culture.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.180]   We've adopted the lie that parenting is hard.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.700]   We've adopted the lie that teaching is hard.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.940]   We've adopted the lie that learning is hard.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.300]   And we've adopted the lie that teenagers rebel,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.540]   that teenagers are rebellious.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.400]   And I will tell you, if you give your children truth,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.940]   they don't rebel.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.780]   - Right.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.220]   - There's nothing for them to rebel against.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.540]   You're gonna rebel against the truth?
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.860]   That's like rebelling against God.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.900]   Good luck with that.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.660]   - Right, that's not gonna end well.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.340]   - It doesn't turn out well when you do that.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.700]   - It does not end well.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.620]   - Right, so that's the beautiful thing.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.540]   And when my kids were teens, my husband traveled a lot.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.420]   And I would often go, in fact, because I worked
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.700]   from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every day,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.180]   I did a nationally syndicated radio show
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.780]   while I was home educating my kid.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.620]   - Right, right.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.820]   - Which is why when people say, "Well, I work."
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.260]   I go, "Well, that's no excuse."
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.100]   Do you have another one? - I know.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.260]   I mean, we all work at something.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.900]   - Right, so I used to go to bed quite early.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.500]   I would be in bed with my laptop doing some research
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.060]   for the show or whatever.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.220]   And my kids, one at a time on various days,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   they would come knock softly on the door
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.740]   and come in and sit down on my bed
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.380]   and just sort of download their day.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.340]   They just wanted to have relationship.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.100]   - They just wanted to connect.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.340]   And I would always like gently fold my computer,
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.380]   put it to the side and make a mental note
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.460]   that it was gonna be a late night for me or whatever.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.580]   - Yes.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.520]   - But I would never turn them down.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.740]   That was the precious stuff, man.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.060]   That was the icing, that was the good stuff.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.100]   And you're denied that when you send your child to school
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.860]   because the school comes between you and the child.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.700]   - Yes.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.980]   - And so there's all, and by the way,
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.300]   the child knows that the school is lying to them
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.340]   and they know that you as the parent put your child there.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.800]   - Right, that you have defaulted to that.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.640]   - So you've betrayed them.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.860]   - You have defaulted, abdicated your responsibility.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.700]   - And it's a betrayal.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.220]   And it's hard to overcome that betrayal.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.860]   I had a mother in one of my conferences break down
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.460]   and stand up and say, "I owe my daughter an apology."
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.340]   And her daughter was there in the room with the granddaughter.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.720]   She said, "I have to apologize to you right now
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.700]   "because I really want you to homeschool your granddaughter
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.980]   "and I'm sorry for not homeschooling."
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.920]   - Yes, that.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   - It was an amazing thing because you can take responsibility
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.700]   what little responsibility you may have, right?
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.300]   She doesn't, it really isn't her fault
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.500]   that she just followed the way of the world
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.220]   and sent the children to school.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.020]   - Right, I mean, we didn't know that there was an option.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.500]   Nobody was painting a picture that this was doable
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.780]   and that this was preferable and that there's a way.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.300]   You didn't even know, 30 years ago,
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.940]   you didn't really know it was a choice
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.600]   for quote unquote regular people to do this.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.340]   But here's the thing, no one else did it.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.400]   She is the one who did it.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   And so there's no shame in taking responsibility,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.540]   asking for forgiveness and moving on.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.500]   That's the beauty of our religion, right?
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.740]   Is that it's centered on forgiveness
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.940]   and this idea that you can seek forgiveness
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.360]   and you can be redeemed.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   And so she sought that redemption in my conference
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.100]   and the daughter proclaimed that she would homeschool
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.440]   her little girl instead of sending her to school
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.780]   because she then recognized the damage that had been done
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.280]   to her relationship with her mother by the school.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.760]   - Yes, yes.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.780]   - And by the way, let's be clear.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.940]   I don't know how far this is gonna go
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.520]   or who's going to listen to it.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.320]   I do not blame teachers.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.520]   I think teachers are caught in a system.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.360]   - Right.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.160]   - And by and large, there are a lot of teachers
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.300]   who are just keeping their heads down
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.920]   and trying to keep their paychecks and stuff.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.420]   And I understand that.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.580]   So I don't go after teachers at all.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.420]   But I do go after the system and I have been quoted
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.200]   as saying that they do wanna have sex
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.120]   with your children in school.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.220]   - Yeah, I know what you mean by that.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.280]   - I was quoted at a school board meeting.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.980]   - Take that one out of context and run with it, yeah.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.700]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.820]   The pornography and the grooming that is happening
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.940]   in our schools right now is, it's mind boggling really.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:49.820]   I'm so disheartened by it and frustrated
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.460]   that parents are so uneducated,
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.240]   and I don't use that term lightly,
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.200]   but they are so schooled and not educated
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.580]   that they cannot see the writing on the wall.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.260]   - I do wanna let our listeners know
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.780]   that Miracle in East Texas is now streaming
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:13.380]   and you can use the discussion guide.
