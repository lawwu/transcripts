[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:11.920]   First speaker today is SC Gutierrez,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.920]   wherever she is, did I get that right?
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.840]   See, I knew it, we practiced this.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   (laughing)
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.360]   And she's gonna talk about what you need to know
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.300]   before you invest, how to set your savings target.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.360]   SC is the CEO of Aptis Financial,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.920]   and she holds a MPP from Harvard University,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.040]   is a certified financial planner,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.280]   a certified retirement plan specialist.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.560]   And she is the author of "But First, Save 10,"
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.800]   "The One Simple Money Move That Will Change Your Life."
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200]   And her company, Aptis Financial,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600]   provides a flat-free financial planning services
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.400]   for early career attending physicians
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.360]   and other young professionals.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.120]   So SC, you have the mic.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.440]   - Thank you, Rick.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.240]   It is great to be here today,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.640]   and I am such a fangirl of everything Boglehead
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.680]   and this conference, and I have a story
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.000]   that I told Christine, she was like,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600]   "You gotta tell everyone this story."
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.280]   So I used to be a sell-side stock analyst, actually.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.400]   So we are the ones that would recommend
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.720]   whether people should buy, sell, or hold
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840]   in their mutual funds, stocks in their mutual funds.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   And I read the book,
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.360]   the little book of "Common Sense Investing,"
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.520]   and it just changed everything.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   And I left my job and started a new company
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.020]   to do financial advice in a new way,
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.720]   all because of Jack Bogle and his inspiration.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   So it is a really big deal to be here with you all today.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.640]   And I keep meeting people who are like,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.360]   "This is my fourth conference."
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.440]   Like, I wanna be that person, like,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.080]   "This is my 10th conference."
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.160]   Like, that's gonna be me here one day, I promise.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.760]   Okay.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   So today, actually, went too far.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.560]   Today, what we're gonna do is we are gonna combat
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.480]   something that's happening in the financial industry,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   and the financial industry is doing one thing to us.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.360]   They're telling us, "We need you to care about one thing.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.040]   "What's the one thing that we need to care about?"
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.500]   What, retirement?
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.160]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.700]   But what's continuously being asked of us
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.800]   is that we care about investing.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.400]   We need to care about the latest hot mutual fund to buy.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.440]   We need to care about buying or not buying crypto.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   That's where the conversation is being had.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.360]   And what's interesting is we're in the middle
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.740]   of a retirement crisis, right?
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.720]   So we just saw the first people who were in this thing
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.160]   called the 401(k), a defined contribution plan.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.800]   The first group of people, as we switch from pensions
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   to defined contribution plans.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.640]   Tell us whether this experiment was successful or a failure.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.460]   What was it?
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.600]   Here, right?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.760]   We're still talking about investments.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.840]   I run retirement plans.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.880]   You know the only thing they care about in retirement plans?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.680]   The investment menu.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   Are people saving in it, are they not?
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.840]   No, we just care about the investment menu, right?
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.640]   So here's the funny thing is, we are parroting back
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.960]   exactly what they're asking us to talk about.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   So in our financial planning firm,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   we have people who write in, "I wanna work with your firm."
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.000]   And so they'll say, "Can you help me with investments?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.840]   "Can you help me with this?"
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.320]   And y'all, I love investments.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.760]   But you're looking at their portfolio and going,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.780]   "We need to be talking about something a little different.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.980]   "What do we need to be talking about?
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.560]   "What do you need in order to invest?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.480]   "What's the first thing you have to have?"
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.760]   Money.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   Money, money, money, money, money.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   That's what we gotta have, we gotta have money.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.940]   Okay, so let's start there.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.080]   Does anybody in this room think that any young person
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.600]   in America does not know I need to spend less than I make?
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.440]   Right?
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.500]   I mean, we know that, right?
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.120]   No one would be like, "Oh, that never occurred to me," right?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.440]   Like, we all know that.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   But here's the big question I have.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   Does any young person really know how much to save?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.480]   But you know there is an answer, right?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.800]   If you're median income and you're 22 years old
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   and you expect to reasonably retire in your 60s,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.360]   we know you need to save 10%, right?
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.040]   Right, save 10%.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.300]   That's gonna get you to retirement.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.840]   You're gonna be able to replace your income.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.640]   You're gonna be able to probably maintain your lifestyle.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.320]   And that's assuming a five or 6% rate of return, right?
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.760]   Like, we're not talking about anything crazy.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.640]   Save 10%, save 10%.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.520]   It's a real simple idea.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.380]   But why are we not discussing it?
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.680]   Does anybody here know what your percentage savings rate is
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.160]   that you need for you to be able to stop working one day
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.200]   on your own terms?
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.320]   People don't know our number.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.880]   So I'm gonna tell you my number right now.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.920]   I have a 35% savings rate.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.840]   Sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 30.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.440]   I am aiming to be able to be work optional
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.560]   'cause I do not resonate with the word retire.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.520]   I love what I do.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.240]   I like to use the words work optional.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.100]   I wanna be work optional in my 40s.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.860]   Have I told you anything about my wealth?
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.980]   Nothing, right?
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.080]   You know nothing.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.520]   You don't know how much money I have.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.920]   You don't know how much money I will have, right?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.200]   We can openly discuss our savings rate, folks.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.720]   Do you realize that?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.600]   We are allowed to absolutely talk about
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.800]   how much car we buy, how much house we buy.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   We can absolutely show any measure of our spending.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.060]   But the moment that we wanna talk about wealth,
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.120]   that is suddenly taboo.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.300]   So we live in a society that only talks about spending
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.480]   because it's taboo to talk about saving.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.120]   But this metric that we're gonna do today,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.200]   you are gonna walk out of this room with a number.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   It's your number.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.120]   You're gonna walk out of this room with this number.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.000]   I want you to talk about it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.400]   I want you to share it, not just with Bogleheads.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.160]   Yes, we share a lot of things at Bogleheads, right?
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.840]   I'm talking about the greater world.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   We are all better off if we all save enough to retire.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.100]   All of us.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.800]   This is not a pie thing, okay?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.140]   We're talking about growing the pie here together.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.460]   So I want you all to not only take your number away
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.720]   that we're gonna calculate today,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.620]   or get a start with today, I'll explain in a second,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.180]   but I want you to take it to your people that you love,
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.180]   to your kids, to your spouse, to your grandkids.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.540]   Take this notion of we talk about
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.740]   our savings rate as a society.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.760]   Okay, so this is a math problem, right?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.380]   It's a math problem?
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.220]   Just math.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.620]   If we just knew our savings rate,
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.180]   we're gonna solve the retirement crisis, right?
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.660]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.540]   Okay, we're not.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   So this is my budgeting system
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.260]   when I got out of college and got my first job.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.020]   And I was sitting across from the HR director,
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.880]   and she said to me,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   "Okay, so your salary is going to be $23,000 a year."
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.720]   And I remember looking at her going,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.580]   "I will never be able to spend all that money."
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.580]   But we know what happened, right?
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.460]   Okay, so this is the rite of passage
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.520]   for all young people in America.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.700]   Anything different is un-American.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.300]   So we get the money in, and we pay our bills.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.340]   And we assume, because we lived on less
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.180]   before a broke college student,
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.320]   that we're just gonna spend so little
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.620]   that there's gonna be money just piling up
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620]   in our checking accounts,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.940]   and we're gonna have to get a shovel out
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.980]   to put it into a savings account, right?
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.620]   But what we actually do is we break even.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.060]   Now, I'm gonna explain why we break even,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.360]   but we operationally break even.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.340]   And then somebody pounds through my Honda Civics
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.460]   back window to steal my radio.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.220]   This was in 2001, when we had radios.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.860]   And I had to pay for that, because my deductible was $500.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   And so I went into debt, right?
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.620]   And then I get a flat tire, so I get into more debt, right?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.540]   Debt, because I was operationally break even,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.780]   and couldn't afford those things that come up.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.420]   So I know how we can solve this problem.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.620]   All we need to do is just make more money.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.900]   The reason I couldn't save
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.740]   was 'cause I didn't make enough money.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.660]   So I remember when I started
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.220]   my financial planning practice,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.980]   I was gonna help like normal people,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.300]   like nurses and firefighters.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.360]   They could just pay a fee,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.820]   and I'd help them get on a budget, it was very exciting.
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.780]   But one of my first phone calls was from a physician.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.200]   And she made $250,000 a year, but couldn't make ends meet.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   So she took on extra shifts as a single mom in the ED.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.380]   And so her income was $325,000 a year.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.100]   And I thought, oh, no worries, yeah, come on in.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.260]   We're gonna fix this.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.060]   And I'm already thinking,
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.320]   there is so much money here to go around.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.980]   We're gonna work this out easily,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.460]   because I don't make that much money,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.660]   and I live on so much less, this is gonna be really easy.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.300]   So she comes in, and we start going line by line.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.220]   And I start sweating, 'cause I'm like in her life now.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.420]   And I'm going, what are we gonna do?
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.300]   We can't possibly make it
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.060]   on anything less than $400,000 a year, right?
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.660]   Okay, so is this a math problem, folks?
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.780]   No, this is not a math problem.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.740]   Okay, but here's the problem.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.220]   It's a big problem.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.620]   So, okay, I'm married, and I have kids,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.180]   and I'm 44 years old.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.500]   I have a lot of stressors in my life, right?
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.940]   Stressors that are completely out of my control.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.980]   But what's wild to me is that
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.220]   if you look at one of the biggest stressors
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   that we have in life, finance is one of them.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.860]   Finance is always like a stress,
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.460]   it's like one of the top causes of divorce.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.840]   So I had this in my early 20s, stress, stress, stress.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.860]   I felt this.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.140]   But what's crazy to me is we feel like
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.820]   everything's chaos, complicated,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.340]   it weighs on our relationships.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.740]   And so then we go spend more because of YOLO, okay?
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.020]   I did all that.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.220]   But it's all made up, right?
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.460]   Financial stress is completely artificial
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.260]   because you can have it or you can choose not to have it.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.420]   So that's what's crazy to me.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.100]   So is this an intellectual problem?
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.260]   Is this about being smart enough?
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.680]   Maybe if we're super smart,
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.040]   we'll be really good with money.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.280]   Is that it?
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.560]   Are physicians not very smart?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.340]   Because did you know that 25% of physicians
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.980]   who are in their 60s do not even have a million dollars?
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.020]   So if you do the math on that
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.400]   and you make about 250 or $300,000 a year,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.860]   that's what you live on essentially,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.020]   how long is that million dollars gonna last?
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.300]   Does not take complicated math to figure that out.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.900]   So is this an intellect problem?
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.740]   No.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.300]   So lots of people are gonna assign a lot of blame
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.800]   to our savings problem, but I'm gonna give you mine
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.080]   and because I'm the person up here,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.440]   we're all gonna believe it.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.000]   Set point theory of happiness is my,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.240]   it sounds so sweet, doesn't it?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.740]   What a sweet thing that we have in our brains.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.360]   The set point theory of happiness.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.280]   Has anybody heard of this?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.240]   Well, has anybody heard of the hedonic treadmill?
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.320]   That sounds a lot darker.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.360]   I like the more optimistic one.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.880]   Set point theory of happiness.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.340]   It is a wonderful brain phenomenon
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.700]   because here's the deal.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.900]   We all in this room have a baseline happiness.
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.660]   I might be a little bit higher,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.860]   you might be a little lower, but it's our own baseline.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.620]   And here's what's unbelievable.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.180]   We can have something super terrible happen to us
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.220]   in our lives and our happiness can plummet.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.720]   But look what's gonna happen after it plummets.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.240]   Our brains are gonna fight to get us back
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   to our set point happiness.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.520]   What an incredible adaptive thing.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.720]   Jonathan Haidt, who wrote "Anxious Generation,"
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   he writes about this in "The Happiness Hypothesis"
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.500]   and he talks about that study of quadriplegics
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.080]   who in a terrible accident,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.820]   they lose the use of arms and legs
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.480]   and within a year are kind of statistically back
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.280]   to their same level of happiness.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.460]   What an incredible adaptation.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.360]   But on the flip side, I'm in the Kahara market.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.780]   I drive a minivan and I feel like
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.480]   I would look really good in a Porsche Cayenne.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.100]   Do we all agree with that?
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.500]   Black?
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.060]   I mean, we all can agree.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.660]   I'll roll down the windows and my hair will be flying
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.700]   and people will be like,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.220]   "Look at that very successful woman."
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.040]   Because right now I have a minivan
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.740]   that has Chick-fil-A stuck in the corners
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.380]   and my kids are in the back in car seats.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.220]   I am a soccer mom.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   My whole identity can change and you know what?
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.420]   I will be happy.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.960]   I will be happy for a very long time.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.000]   See, this is what my brain is actually telling me.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.400]   Do you know that my brain actually said these things to me?
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.080]   Oh, my son really wants me to get a Porsche Cayenne.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.400]   He goes, "Mom, think of all the friends you'll have."
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.780]   I waited a while and then he said,
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.400]   "They're probably not very good friends."
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.740]   Okay, so here's what's happening in the brain.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.220]   So the brain is gonna fight
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.780]   because it loves those dopamine hits that take us high.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.220]   But then our limbic system
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.860]   is just gonna bring us right back down.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.060]   And so then a Porsche Cayenne,
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.620]   gosh, to get to that same level of happiness,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.140]   I'm gonna have to get like a Rivian or something.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.460]   It's not gonna work.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.920]   It doesn't work.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.180]   This is what's happening to us.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.220]   We are fully adapting to whatever money we have
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.140]   or don't have.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.500]   We're adapting to OPM, other people's money.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.820]   We've got credit card debt.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.100]   We can buy now pay later with afterpay.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.060]   This is what's happening.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.920]   So if we don't understand what is happening in our brain,
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.040]   then we will constantly be victims to it.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   So we have two jobs today.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.500]   First of all, we need to know the math.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.260]   We need to know the math of what it will take
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.500]   for us to be able to one day
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.220]   stop working on our own terms, okay?
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.680]   Does anybody in here like the idea
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.940]   of being forced to work through your 60s or later
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.420]   and not being able to stop if you get sick
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.160]   or just wanna stop on your own terms?
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.100]   Anybody like that idea?
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.220]   No.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.100]   But it's funny, when I ask people if they wanna retire,
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.660]   people don't really raise their hands.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.100]   So that's why I use,
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.240]   I want you to one day have the option
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.580]   to be able to stop working on your own terms.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.800]   That usually resonates with most people.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.360]   So we got into the math of it,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.220]   but then we have to also understand
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.760]   that our brain is a vicious, vicious animal
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.200]   when it comes to money, I promise you.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.920]   It is not built, we are not,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.400]   our brains are not built for money.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.640]   I could keep on going.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.300]   There are so many other brain factors that we have
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.880]   that make us bad with money.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.320]   So if any of you are walking in with fear or shame
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.480]   when it comes to money, let it all go.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.920]   It's our own brains that we're reckoning with here.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.960]   So if you know that and you respect that
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.640]   and you can't say, oh, I'll just think my way through it,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.820]   then we can set up a system, a system.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.820]   And folks, this is the only curse word
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.320]   I'm gonna use this whole time.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.520]   We'll set up a budget.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.800]   Okay.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.720]   This is what we have to do.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   It's as simple as this.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.420]   And you're gonna get a session right after this
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.280]   that follows exactly this, okay?
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.720]   You have to pay yourself first.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.160]   And I know that sounds so like, aw, that's so cute,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.540]   like a five-year-old could do it.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.000]   No, let me tell you, I have seen millionaires
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.960]   who are break even, paycheck to paycheck,
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.240]   get on this system.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.760]   This is the only system that works
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.880]   because it's the system that tricks that hedonic treadmill.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.040]   It tricks that set point theory of happiness.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.720]   And all you're doing, folks, get this,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.040]   you're just getting the money out of there
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.160]   before it hits your paycheck.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.120]   That's it.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.760]   You might think it doesn't work.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.240]   Here's a crazy statistic.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.200]   Did you know you are 12 times more likely
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   to save for retirement
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.680]   just by having a retirement plan at work?
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.000]   12 times more likely to save.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.220]   The crazy thing is it's because they take your money
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.620]   out of your paycheck and they make it disappear.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.720]   That's it.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.840]   So you do that.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.000]   You do that with your money.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.800]   Get your money out and make it disappear.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.280]   And now you know how much to take out, right?
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.720]   Now you know I need to take this percentage out
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.400]   and make it simply disappear.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.520]   Later, I'm going to be giving a talk
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.200]   on the places where I think you should make it disappear
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.440]   based on tax efficiency.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.860]   We're gonna get to that later.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.680]   But fundamentally, I just want you to think,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.760]   once I know my number, I need to get it out of my life.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.080]   Get it into other buckets that I don't see,
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.720]   that I don't play with, and then that will work.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.420]   Pay yourself first.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.520]   You know, it's crazy to me to think
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.200]   when people can't retire
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.000]   that they would look back on all those paychecks
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.760]   from all those months that they worked in their lives
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.920]   and realize something very fundamental.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.840]   I paid everyone else first in my life.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.520]   I paid my taxes first.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.120]   I paid my health insurance first.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.280]   I paid the mortgage first.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.400]   I paid the car payment first.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.720]   I paid private school first.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.100]   I paid everybody else first.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.380]   But I never put aside for myself.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.060]   So if any of you are in that situation,
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.420]   this is what I want for you.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.340]   I want you paying yourself first
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.600]   before you pay anyone else.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.320]   So now let's do the numbers.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.680]   So there's gonna be two tables here.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.800]   These are your slides.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.640]   I think they're gonna get these slide decks, right, Rick?
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.520]   - Yes.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.360]   - These are gonna be yours.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.600]   You don't have to take a picture of it.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.440]   You can.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.380]   It might be hard with how small these numbers are.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.200]   This can be a start.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.800]   This can be the moment where you're like,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.160]   I am going to experiment with this number in my life
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.620]   to see if this could be my savings rate.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.260]   So let me explain how this works.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.380]   So if you are median income
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:08.980]   and you are fine with a work optional age of, say, 65,
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:15.220]   then what you can do is you can do a little math.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.620]   How much money do you have right now?
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.660]   Think about that.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.860]   Add it all up in your retirement accounts.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.400]   Not home equity, just retirement accounts,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.540]   brokerage accounts, add 'em all up.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.780]   And I mean, if y'all wanted to do this right now,
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.980]   we'll kind of, we have time.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.420]   So we're gonna, these are my last two slides.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.860]   So we got a few minutes here.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.100]   So add up all that money
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.160]   and then divide it by your income,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.180]   your current income right now.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.100]   And that is how you're gonna find
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.540]   which column you're gonna be in.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.500]   So here's an example.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.500]   Let's say you have $500,000 in assets right now
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.940]   and you make 100,000 between you and your spouse.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.820]   Should never do public math,
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.340]   but I believe that puts me in the five times column.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.860]   Yes, I see some nodding, good.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.020]   We've done math well together.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.160]   And let's say that I am 50 years old.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.340]   You can see that I would need to have
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.220]   about a 15% savings rate.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.380]   So I'm median income because between myself and my spouse,
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.920]   we make $100,000 a year.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.180]   We've been able to manage to save 500,000
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.420]   over the course of this time.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   Maybe we were saving 5% into our retirement plan
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.660]   and our company was matching us a little bit,
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   but we've kind of missed the mark a little.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.840]   So instead of saving 10%, we got to catch up a tiny bit.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.600]   We've got to get to a 15% savings rate.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.620]   That is gonna allow me to have a shot
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.980]   at retiring by the time I'm 65.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.220]   Now, a lot can change.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.480]   We can't guarantee that there's gonna be
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.060]   a nice steady rate of return of five to 6%,
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.660]   but in general, this could be a start.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.880]   Now, you can also use some other calculators
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.260]   to try to triangulate this a little bit,
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.820]   but I want you to have a starting target today
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.200]   that you can start with.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.160]   So has anybody gotten your savings rate off this table?
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.140]   Has anybody been able to calculate it?
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.120]   Yes, does anybody wanna share what their savings rate is?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.860]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.600]   5%.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.600]   You'll see, we're gonna do a book giveaway.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.520]   I wrote a book called "But First, Save 10."
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   I assume that most people don't actually read books anymore,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.840]   so I just put the whole thing in the title.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.040]   Just save 10%, folks, just save 10%, that's it.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.060]   So this book is yours.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.840]   You probably could give it away to somebody if you wish,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.680]   but yes, thank you so much for sharing that.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.080]   Was that scary to share?
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.560]   No, because I don't know anything about your wealth.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.480]   I know nothing.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.400]   See, it's safe.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.680]   We can share this number.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.780]   Okay, so let's say you are higher income.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.360]   So it's a little harder to retire in the same way.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.080]   It's a little harder to have these lower savings rates
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.120]   when you make more money.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.220]   Social security is not gonna have as big of an impact
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.960]   in replacing your income,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.840]   and so it's a little bit harder, actually,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.780]   to retire and replace your income when you make more money.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.040]   So that's why you'll see that on the high-income households,
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.280]   you're gonna have higher savings rates
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.040]   in these assumptions.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.280]   So again, the same math to kind of start
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.400]   trying to figure out your number,
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.960]   but you'll see that the savings rates are quite a bit higher.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   So a lot of people say, "I save X percentage," right?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.800]   So there are people who talk about saving as a percentage,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.760]   and there's some people that talk about saving
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.960]   as a percentage of their net pay,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.340]   so their pay after they pay their taxes.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.160]   I think it's a little easier to talk about
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.560]   saving as a percentage of your gross pay,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.820]   because that way we're all on the same page
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.140]   on exactly where we are on our savings rate.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.760]   So that's what all of these numbers are based on,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   is our percentage of our gross pay.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   So I wanted to show you just the simple math
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.200]   of how to apply this.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.640]   So you take your gross pay,
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.000]   which is you are going to make $23,000 a year
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.800]   times the 10% I should have been saving,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   and then it equals how much money you should make.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   So in this case, $150,000 times 15% is 22,500.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.780]   Any questions on that?
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:58.520]   Okay, so the final step here is you automate it.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.600]   I hope that all of you are extremely motivated
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   to go apply your savings rate.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.800]   I hope you are all excited to go tell everybody
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.960]   to pick a savings rate and to be proud of it
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.440]   and to make it disappear and go away.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.720]   But how many months is your brain motivated?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.760]   Does anybody know?
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.640]   To do something.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.720]   The prefrontal cortex,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.520]   when it makes a decision to do something,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.680]   how many months will it be excited about something?
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.160]   Two weeks, that's funny.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.320]   That's more, we're on the same page.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.220]   So some people, it can be as much as three months.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.540]   You can be excited.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.120]   So a lot of people will tell me I love this
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.480]   and I'm gonna make those transfers mindfully
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.400]   into my brokerage account or into an IRA or a Roth IRA.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.920]   Please don't do that.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.640]   The financial industry has done us a huge favor
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.280]   in helping us figure out how to automate our decisions.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.860]   And trust me on this point,
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.920]   once you figure out where your money will go,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.300]   the amount of money and where it goes,
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.180]   I want you to take the final step to automate it
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.960]   and I cannot overstate this.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.400]   By you saying on the eighth of every single month,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.540]   I want this much money to transfer out
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.160]   of this checking account and go into this brokerage account
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.040]   and automatically purchase these three mutual funds.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.500]   You can do this and then you can check in on it
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.160]   every three to six months,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.740]   but do not skip this step
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.760]   because this is where people get into trouble
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.280]   or they try to time the market.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.800]   Oh, this seems like a really terrible time
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.360]   to be putting money in a brokerage account.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.280]   The market's up, the market's down, the market's flat.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.520]   It's always a bad time, right?
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.240]   So this also prevents you from market timing.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.160]   So I think I am right at time,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.600]   but I am going to be hanging around.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.760]   If anybody has any questions for me, let me know,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.720]   but thank you all so much.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.940]   you
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:06.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
