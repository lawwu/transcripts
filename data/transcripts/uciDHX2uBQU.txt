[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   I read once more for our consideration the words that are to be found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.800]   to the Romans in chapter 8, verses 28, 29, and 30.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.920]   And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.000]   are the called according to his purpose; for whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.480]   it to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480]   brethren.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.560]   Moreover, whom he did predestine it, them he also called; and whom he called, them he
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.200]   also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.320]   We are still continuing our consideration of the great doctrine contained in those verses,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.360]   namely the doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   And we've reached the stage, most of you will recall, in which we are dealing with the difficulties
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.960]   that people experience with respect to this doctrine.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   There are a number of statements in the Scripture that on the surface seem to deny it, and we
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   are trying to deal with those Scriptures in order that we've got, indeed, we've got two
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.600]   main reasons.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.200]   The first is that we all may enjoy the positive value of this doctrine.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.840]   That's certainly my main interest in it.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   I'm suggesting that it was the apostles' interest in it.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280]   It's a pastoral interest, not a mere intellectual interest.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.720]   Primarily, this is a pastoral matter.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.600]   It is the importance of having assurance of salvation, and of knowing that your salvation
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.240]   is not something which you may suddenly lose at any moment.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.640]   It is implicit and inherent in the whole notion of assurance that it should continue.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.240]   You can't be assured of something which may go at any minute.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.640]   So it is, I say, very vital to a true enjoyment of the Christian salvation that we should
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240]   be clear about this great doctrine.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.640]   I'm not concerned primarily simply to defend the doctrine.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.400]   I'm interested in the doctrine because of what it does for us, and we are given it by
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.540]   God in order that as his children we may enjoy the fruits of his grace and of his dealing
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.200]   with us in our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well very well then, that's my main reason for dealing with it, but I have of course
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.420]   a secondary subsidiary pastoral reason, and that is that the passages which we are considering
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.960]   and which seem to militate against this doctrine are the passages of all passages in the scripture
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.940]   that most frequently give distress and trouble to many of God's people.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.020]   So I've got that secondary objective in my mind as we are dealing with these various
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.140]   statements of the scripture.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.820]   In other words, we've got a positive reason and a negative one.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.100]   The positive being that there is no more glorious doctrine than this.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.900]   And the second one, the negative one, is that the devil attacks us strongly at this point
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.180]   obviously because of its great importance.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.220]   And he does hold many of God's children in a state of captivity because of their failure
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.020]   truly to understand the meaning of some of these passages.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.300]   Very well.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.140]   We've come now to the point where we're dealing with the so-called warning passages.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.520]   We've dealt with others.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.100]   This is the most important group, and they generally refer to us these warning passages.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.060]   We began considering them last Friday night.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.340]   I tried to lay down certain principles of interpretation.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.700]   The first was this, that we must always remember the state and the condition of the visible
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   church.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.300]   The visible church consists of people who are truly Christian and some who are not.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.700]   If we don't hold that key in our hand, we'll probably go astray on most of these passages.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.540]   But the moment we grasp that vital teaching concerning the state of the visible church,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.940]   then we are more than halfway to the resolution of most of these problems.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.300]   Then the second point I made was, the second line of interpretation we laid down was this
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:59.100]   one, that the primary function of these warning passages is to test us in that respect as
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.820]   to whether we've got a true faith or a temporary faith, whether we have a true experience or
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.140]   a false one.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.220]   Now that is their object.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.140]   Are we true professors or are we false professors?
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.820]   We worked that out in terms of the ten virgins, where yet other adjectives are used, wise
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.220]   or foolish.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.020]   The trouble with the foolish virgins we saw was that while they made a profession, it
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.580]   was a false one, and they were foolish because they assumed that everything was all right.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.360]   Then we dealt also with the passage, the statement in Revelations 3, 5.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.620]   That statement about the risen Lord speaking to the church at Sardis tells them that if
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.000]   they do certain things, that he will not plot out their name out of the book of life.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200]   And we saw the meaning of that.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   Well now we resume at that point.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.640]   My attention was directed by a friend very rightly to a statement found at the very end
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.080]   of that book of Revelation in chapter 22 and in verse 19, where you read, "And if any man
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.680]   shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.000]   part out of the book of life and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.240]   in this book."
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   He wondered why I hadn't dealt with that.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.120]   Well the answer is this.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.720]   It's generally agreed, I think this is almost universal, that the authorized translation
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.560]   at this point is not right.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.600]   It isn't the book of life, it's the tree of life.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.360]   I was concerned to deal with passages that refer to the book of life.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   This doesn't.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.200]   It's just a wrong translation.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.140]   This is a reference to the tree of life about which he's been speaking earlier on.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.000]   But quite apart from that, what was said with regard to the other passages, of course, is
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.920]   as applicable here as it was there.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.520]   But I just mentioned that in passing, lest somebody else also should have thought of
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.160]   the same passage.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.840]   Now there is, in addition to that, just one other word I'd like to say on that, and that
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.940]   is, of course, our Lord's word to the disciples, the Seventy, when he sent them out to preach
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.920]   and to cast out devils.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.200]   And you remember they came back very elated and bursting.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.320]   They said, "Even the devils are made subject unto us."
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.000]   And our Lord said this to them, "In this, rejoice not that the devils are made subject
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.680]   unto you, but rejoice rather that your names are written in heaven."
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   Now there it isn't the book of life, but it comes to the same thing.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.000]   It is our names written in heaven.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.800]   He says that's the thing to rejoice in.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.240]   Not that you've got this power which I've given you, and that you've been able to do
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:58.000]   certain things, in this rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.840]   And as we saw abundantly last week, if your name is once written there, well that's permanent.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.960]   Because the only alternative is that God made a mistake.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.400]   Even in his omniscience and his foreknowledge, he put down a name that he's got to withdraw,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.360]   which is of course just unthinkable and impossible.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.280]   Whatever view you may chance to take of the foreknowledge of God.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.240]   This is the thing to rejoice in, that our names are written in heaven.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   Very well.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.040]   Now then, let us move on to two other passages.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.000]   I've already referred to them very briefly a few weeks ago.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.920]   But I come back to them tonight, and I don't apologize for doing so.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.680]   I do so mainly for the second of my two reasons that I've already been giving you, the negative
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   one.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:00.040]   There are no two passages that I can say most certainly, in some 35 years by now of pastoral
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   experience, there are no two passages that have more frequently given people trouble
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:13.440]   and caused them soul distress and agony, than the passage in Hebrew 6, and the corresponding
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.760]   passage in Hebrews 10.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.680]   Hebrews 6, 4 to 8, and Hebrews 10, 26 to 29.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.960]   I come back to them, I say, because I dealt with them very hurriedly that night when we
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.240]   were dealing with a large number of passages.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.440]   And I'm so concerned that nobody should be held in bondage by Satan, owing to a misunderstanding
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.360]   of this particular statement, which is made in two forms.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.320]   It's because of that I say that I come back to it.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   Now, I am not saying that these are the two most difficult passages, because I don't think
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   they are.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   But I am saying that they're the ones that the devil seems to use most frequently, in
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.760]   order to distress and to trouble God's children.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   Very well, you are familiar with the passage.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.680]   I read the first one to you in the reading at the beginning.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.640]   It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.000]   were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.240]   powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.600]   seeing they crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:42.760]   And in Hebrews 10, 26 to 29, "For if we sin willfully after that we have received the
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.080]   knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.360]   looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   He that despised Moses' law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses, of how much
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.040]   of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.320]   thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace."
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.120]   Well now, there are our two passages.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.440]   Let's look at them.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:35.400]   First of all, let us look at the wrong explanation and exposition of those two portions of Scripture.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:42.360]   The first wrong exposition, clearly, is the one that says, well, there you are, there's
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:50.920]   something which is plain, clear, explicit, teaching us that it is possible for someone
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:58.080]   who has been truly Christian, as described here, to fall away altogether and to be finally
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   reprobate.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.440]   Well, I mention that because that's what I'm going to deal with.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.400]   I put it down as the first wrong and false explanation.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:16.760]   But as I'm going to deal with that, let me move to a second false explanation.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.880]   I came across this once more, quite recently, indeed since last Friday, reading a certain
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   journal.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.400]   There was a man dealing with this passage, and he contended that it could be dealt with
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.520]   quite simply, that the author of the epistle to the Hebrews was here not dealing with Christians
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:44.200]   at all in any sense, that he was dealing simply with the unbelieving Jews, the Jews to whom
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.040]   the gospel had been preached, but who would have nothing at all to do with it.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.960]   So he felt that thereby he was safeguarding this great doctrine of the final perseverance
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.800]   of the saints by saying that Hebrews 6 has nothing at all to do with Christians, Christians
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   in any shape or form, Christian even in inverted commas.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.880]   It simply says dealing with the unconverted Jews who had never believed the gospel at
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.880]   all.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.920]   Now I'm putting this down, you notice, as a false exposition.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.080]   I wish I could accept it.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.920]   It would make our problem very much simpler.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.880]   But I can't possibly accept it for these reasons.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   That the letter is addressed to members of churches, the whole assumption of the entire
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.680]   epistle is that it's written to those who belong to the Christian church.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   So I cannot for a moment accept it as being teaching addressed to people who are not within
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.920]   the confines of the church at all.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.280]   There is my first reason for rejecting this.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.520]   Not only that, as I'm going to try to show you, the terms which are used in describing
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:05.280]   these people will not admit, I think, of such an explanation.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.960]   I cannot believe that the people described here in these terms are people who've never
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.520]   had anything at all to do with the faith and with the gospel, who've rejected it from
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.080]   the beginning, and who've remained what they were at the beginning, unbelieving Jews.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.160]   I suggest that there are things told us about them here which make that quite impossible.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.360]   They're not that, whatever else they are.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.720]   They've moved from that.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.960]   As I'm going to show you, they're not Christians, but they're certainly not just unbelieving
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.640]   Jews who've never had anything to do with it at all.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.040]   Not only that, I'm suggesting that we are obviously here in the realm of the church.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.680]   Verse 9 is to me sufficient to prove that, where he says, "But beloved, we are persuaded
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:55.800]   better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   In other words, my argument is that the whole matter is dealt with in terms of the realm
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.840]   of the church.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   So I reject it for that reason.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.280]   And as I shall give you an exposition, I think I'll be able to show that there is no need
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.760]   to fall back upon an explanation like that.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   But then let's consider for a second or two the third wrong and false explanation.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   Now this is a more important one, because it's one that's been put forward many times
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:39.960]   and by some well-known writers and preachers in the history of the Christian church.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:47.480]   It's the argument that depends entirely upon this word "if" at the beginning of verse 6.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.680]   It is impossible for those who were at once enlightened, etc., etc., if they shall fall
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.040]   away to renew them again unto repentance.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:02.680]   Now then, says this exposition, that little word "if" solves the problem.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.120]   He's not saying that anybody ever does this, or that anybody ever has done this, or that
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.080]   anybody ever can do this.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.280]   All he's saying is something purely suppositional.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:21.560]   He says "if," which of course is impossible, but if anybody really did that, if any believer
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.360]   ever did this, then they would be reprobate.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.280]   But he says the supposition is merely for the sake of argument, and it's the sort of
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.240]   thing that is quite impossible and cannot happen at all.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.680]   So they feel that the solution to the problem is the word "if."
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.920]   But why do I reject that?
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.640]   Well, for this reason, that there is no "if" at all in the original.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.160]   It's again a matter of translation.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   Now here it is, you see, in this authorized translation.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.120]   Why is it there, you think?
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.600]   I don't think that's a difficult problem at all.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:03.840]   The men who produced this authorized version of the Scripture were men who not only believed
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:11.760]   in the infallibility of the Scripture and its unique inspiration, they were not only
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.720]   every single one of them fine evangelical men, but they were great theologians and men
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:24.320]   who believed the Scripture and who had therefore believed this great doctrine of the final
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.480]   perseverance of the saints.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.060]   And at this point, their theology obviously governed their translation.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.080]   They were not perfect men, they were fallible men.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.480]   People's theology always governs their translation.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.000]   That's the difficulty about this new one.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.200]   You see, the theology does govern the translation.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.420]   Well that was true even of the translators of the authorized version.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.480]   These men believed in the final perseverance of the saints.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.000]   So in order to safeguard the doctrine, they pushed in the little word "if."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.520]   But it isn't there.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   It's "and."
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:14.680]   It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, etc., and falling away.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   Not if they fall away, and falling away.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.280]   So I have to reject this as an explanation.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.480]   You'll find that, as I say, it's been frequently put forward, that the whole thing
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.720]   is a supposition.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   I confess that there was a time when I used it as an argument myself.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   But it's wrong.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.080]   It's quite wrong.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.680]   You don't get out of this difficulty by saying that it's purely hypothetical.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.560]   A supposed impossible case, just in order to bring out the truth.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.000]   No, you're not entitled to introduce the word "if."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.280]   It's an importation in the interest of the doctrine.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.720]   And I reject it because that means arguing in a circle.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   And it's always wrong to argue in a circle.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.080]   An argument should be a line, and not a circle.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.760]   Otherwise you can prove anything you like.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.120]   You just go round and round, one thing depending on the other.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.000]   You rely upon the thing you're trying to prove to prove the other one, and then you
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.220]   rely on that to prove the first.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.080]   And you can go on doing it endlessly.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.560]   But that's not true argument.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.800]   Very well, I reject all those.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.080]   What then is the correct exposition of this passage?
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.760]   Well, now the way to approach it is, as we've seen with others, to look at it fairly and
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.160]   squarely and examine the terms.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:39.560]   Now, if anywhere people jump to conclusions, now let's see how they do so.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:45.720]   It is impossible, we are told, for those who were once enlightened.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   What does that mean?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.800]   Well, it's taken to mean that they were fully regenerated.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.880]   But it doesn't say that.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:20:02.200]   All it says is that once upon a time, they had received the light of the gospel.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.880]   And when I say they'd received it, I mean this, they'd heard it, and they said they
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   believed it.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.480]   They said they accepted it, they understood it.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.480]   That's what's meant by being enlightened.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.080]   Now, again, here there are some who say that there is another simple explanation, that
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.720]   in New Testament times, the word "enlightened" was used concerning all those who were baptized.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.360]   So that this just means it is impossible for those who were once baptized.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.400]   There may be something in that.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.640]   I don't think we need to accept it.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.080]   I'm not saying it isn't true.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.720]   It can't be proved one way or the other.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.320]   It is a fact, quite definitely, that the baptized were referred to as the enlightened.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.620]   The two terms were used synonymously and interchangeably.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.040]   But it seems to me to be quite unnecessary to fall back on that.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.320]   It is helpful, of course, because then it's just saying that they'd been baptized.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.560]   And that, of course, as we all agreed, doesn't mean that of necessity you're a Christian.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.240]   The fact that you're baptized as an infant doesn't prove that you're a Christian.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.880]   The fact that you're baptized by immersion as an adult doesn't prove that you're a Christian.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.920]   The baptized may be Christians, they may not be Christians.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:24.280]   However, I say that it's much more likely that he's referring to people who apparently
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.240]   say that they believe the teaching of the gospel, once enlightened.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.040]   Then the second term, "tasted of the heavenly gift."
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.240]   Now, here again, is an interesting expression.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:47.520]   Some of the authorities, and amongst them at this point even the great Dr. John Owen,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.640]   seem to me to try to get out of the difficulty by a way that's not legitimate.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:58.600]   Dr. John Owen suggested that the whole secret here is the word "tasted."
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.000]   But the trouble with these people was it only went into their mouths, they never swallowed
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.160]   They never tasted it.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.000]   You see, that's the trouble with them.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.720]   They did flavor it and savor it, but it never went further than the mouth.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.920]   If only they'd thoroughly masticated it and swallowed it, all would have been well
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.640]   tasted of the heavenly gift.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.040]   Now I can't accept that for a moment, and for this reason, that it puts me into difficulty
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:30.080]   immediately with a very great statement in Hebrews chapter 2, verse 9.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.560]   That we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:43.360]   crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   man.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.640]   And it's the same word exactly as in this passage in the sixth chapter.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:56.160]   And I will not accept any explanation that detracts from the full value of tasting death
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.400]   for every man.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.080]   Our Lord didn't just taste it in his mouth.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.880]   He knew death in a way that you and I will never be called upon to know.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   He knew it in all its fullness, in all its bitterness, in all its terrible character.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.620]   No, we mustn't reduce the value of this word.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.280]   And there's another one, you see.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.760]   You remember 1 Peter 2, 3.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.480]   Peter says in 1 Peter 2, 2, "As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.800]   ye may grow thereby, if so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious."
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   Same word.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.080]   And I'm not willing to detract from its value.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.360]   We must give it its full value.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.880]   No, no, it doesn't—we can't resolve our problem and our difficulty in that way.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.200]   Well then what does it mean?
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:58.800]   Well this word, "tasted," does stand for being acquainted with, and even experiencing.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.200]   And I think we can give it its value here.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:10.600]   These people have experienced something of the heavenly gift.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.240]   What's that?
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.760]   Well it's impossible to be too dogmatic about this.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.560]   Everybody's agreed that we can't define it knowing that we're correct.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.640]   There are many possible explanations of it.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.920]   To me it seems to be all that is really given us by the gospel.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.040]   That is what I would call the heavenly gift.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.160]   The thing which is given by the gospel of salvation.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.120]   And these people have experienced something of that.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.360]   Very well.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.880]   Then the next phrase, here is the one that is most difficult of all.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.120]   "And were made partakers of the Holy Ghost."
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:02.680]   Now there you are, says the person who belongs to my first group of false interpreters.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.920]   There you are told quite definitely that these people were born again.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.840]   They're partakers of the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.440]   But wait a minute, what does "partakers of the Holy Ghost" mean?
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   What is a partaker?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   Well the correct answer to that is it means going along with.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.520]   The Schofield Bible has got a very good note at that point.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.440]   Those of you who use it, look at the note that they give you there.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.200]   Schofield very rightly points out that partaker means going along with.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.440]   And indeed that is the meaning of this term.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.880]   It means participant or it means sharer.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.160]   It's sometimes used for an associate, it's sometimes used for a partner.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.200]   And a partner after all is a man who goes along with another man in a business or whatever
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.480]   it may chance to be.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.640]   Now that's the real meaning of this partaker.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:59.280]   You mustn't think that it of necessity means taking right in.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.800]   Now we do talk sometimes about partaking of something in that way, but the word used here
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.840]   really means going along with.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.720]   Taking in a kind of partnership with.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:18.280]   So that it means that you go along with the Holy Ghost in certain respects.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.880]   Now let me illustrate what I mean by that.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.720]   Take a man like King Saul, the first king of Israel.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.160]   You remember that that man received a gift which enabled him to prophesy, and the saying
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.520]   was "Is Saul also amongst the prophets?"
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.880]   Now that was a gift given to him by the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:48.240]   And we can say therefore of Saul that he was a partaker of the Holy Ghost.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:54.480]   The same is true of a man like Balaam, who was a hireling and a false prophet.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.160]   But he by the Holy Ghost was given a certain ability, you remember.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.680]   In other words the Holy Ghost for a certain purpose took him into partnership as he took
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   Saul the king into partnership, he took Balaam into partnership, and he used him.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.160]   So he's a partaker with the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.840]   And then of course when you come to the New Testament we've got similar illustrations
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   and examples.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:28.640]   Judas, Judas undoubtedly, the son of perdition, was a partaker of the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.840]   Our Lord sent out these men, Judas amongst them, gave them power to preach and to cast
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   out devils.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.920]   I've already quoted that from Luke 10.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.680]   Now Judas was amongst them, and it's quite clear that Judas had the same power as the
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.920]   others to cast out devils.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   There was nothing about him that made him stand out as an exception.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   I can prove that to you.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.560]   Do you remember how at the end of his last supper with his disciples our Lord said "One
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.520]   of you is going to betray me."
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.600]   And you remember we are told this, that every one of them was in trouble.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.460]   Each one of them asked "Is it I?"
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.640]   There was nothing about Judas that made him stand out as a man apart.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.320]   Everything that they'd done he'd done.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.560]   They all seemed to be identical.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.520]   So much so that none of them knew, I say, which was the one that really was the betrayer,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   the son of perdition.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:26.840]   There is no doubt whatsoever, Judas was a true partaker of the Holy Ghost in that sense.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.320]   That's what it means.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.480]   The Holy Ghost used him.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.760]   He was thus in this kind of partnership.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.800]   He went along with the Holy Ghost for that particular function and purpose.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.880]   And of course there is the other statement by our Lord himself which settles the matter
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.720]   once and forever.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.320]   Already I've quoted it in this series where he says at the end of the Sermon on the Mount
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.080]   in Matthew 7, 21 and following, "Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.320]   enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.440]   Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.920]   thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.720]   And he doesn't say to them that they hadn't done those things.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.680]   What he says is this, 'Then will I profess unto them, "I never knew you; depart from
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.160]   me ye that work iniquity."'
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.920]   They were partakers of the Holy Ghost.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.120]   But they don't belong to him and he's never known them.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.800]   Now there, it seems to me, is the understanding of this phrase that stumbles people above
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.560]   all others, 'made partakers of the Holy Ghost'.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.840]   Yes, that's what it means.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   That the power is given to them.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.280]   Some would say that it here is a reference primarily perhaps to miraculous gifts and
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.480]   so on.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.720]   That some of them had had these miraculous gifts.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   It's possible.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.440]   It doesn't of necessity mean that we need say that.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.720]   The Holy Ghost has many gifts.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.040]   He can take us along with him in many respects.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.200]   He can do so in understanding up to a point, and in feeling, and in many other ways.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.360]   And still, we are just partakers of the Holy Ghost.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.600]   Then here's another one, 'tasted of the good word of God'.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   What is this?
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:25.440]   Well, this seems to me again to be just a statement referring to an ability to follow
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:33.120]   and to understand the message and the reasoning of this word of God.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.640]   The whole content, if you like, of the scripture.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:44.680]   That these people had had an ability to comprehend and to understand, as it were, the message
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   of the Bible.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.500]   Now, here again, there should be no difficulty, surely.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.200]   That was true of many of the Pharisees.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.960]   They were not only well versed in the scriptures, they had an understanding of the scriptures
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.880]   in many respects.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.800]   There was a profound misunderstanding at the same time, but in many ways, it is possible
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.520]   for us to know about the letter of the scripture.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.000]   Not only that, we can go further than that.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.240]   There are clearly people who are on grounds of sheer intelligence and natural ability,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:27.200]   having read, say, a textbook on theology, can grasp its arguments and its statements,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   and can repeat them.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.520]   They've got this kind of grasp of them, and this kind of understanding of them.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.720]   They have tasted of the good word of God.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:47.200]   And then the final phrase is that they have tasted of the powers of the world to come.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.760]   Well, there's no difficulty about that one.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:59.720]   The powers of the world to come are the powers, of course, of the spiritual realm.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.440]   The age of the Messiah.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.360]   Some expositors say that it refers to this present age.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.720]   There's something to be said for that.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:15.000]   That the epistle to the Hebrews refers to the age to come, when he means the age of
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   the gospel.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.720]   The Jews always spoke about the age to come, the age of the Messiah.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.400]   There are those who argue that this just refers to the Christian era.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   I don't think so.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:29.040]   I think it refers to the age that is yet to come, when the Lord returns, and when he ushers
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.440]   in his everlasting kingdom.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.880]   That's what I think it means by the age and the world to come.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.800]   And there are powers belonging to that.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.280]   Now every time that there is any outpouring of the Spirit of God, the church experiences
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.520]   something of the powers of the world to come.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.120]   It's a foretaste of that.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.680]   That's what it's going to be like then.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.760]   In other words, the Holy Spirit is referred to as not only the seal, but also the earnest
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.520]   of our inheritance.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:05.440]   Everything he gives is a kind of foretaste, a first installment, an earnest of that world
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.280]   to come, and the powers of that world to come.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:15.760]   And we are told, therefore, that these people had had some experience of these powers of
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.600]   the world to come.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   Very well.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.280]   Now there are our statements there.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.000]   Let me just glance at one or two of the difficult statements in chapter 10, in order that I
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.720]   can deal with it as a whole.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.800]   If we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, well, I've already
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   explained that.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.960]   You see, that's rather a good way of putting what we've already explained.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.840]   Received the knowledge of the truth.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.160]   It doesn't say they've received the truth, but they've received the knowledge of the
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   truth.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.360]   That's a very good exposition of one of our previous phrases.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.840]   Once enlightened.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.360]   The people who are once enlightened are the people who have received the knowledge of
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.600]   the truth, not the truth itself.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.360]   However, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.440]   Certain looking for he that despised Moses.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.920]   Here it is in verse 28.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.080]   Of how much sorrow punishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.720]   underfoot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.280]   sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite him the Spirit of grace.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:35.080]   The stumbling phrase is, who hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.280]   sanctified an unholy thing.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.740]   Now this is, there it is.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.800]   We are told that he was sanctified by the blood of the covenant.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.640]   He was set apart by it, yet he now counts it an unholy thing.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   What is the answer there?
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.000]   Well, there are a number of possible answers.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.640]   It need not of necessity say any more than this.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   It's a kind of parallel to what we saw, you remember, in 2 Peter 2, and in the first verse,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.840]   where Peter, you remember, quoting that statement from Deuteronomy 6, puts it like this.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   There were false prophets also among the people, even as there will be false teachers among
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.640]   you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.440]   All it means is this, that they once made that claim.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.040]   They once took up their position with the people, like that mixed multitude in the children
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.360]   of Israel, so they are in the church.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.680]   It's exactly the same here.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.520]   Here they are amongst people, and saying with all other members of the church, that they
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   are saved, set apart for God by the blood of Christ.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.480]   At one point they said that, they claimed that, but then they show very clearly that
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.880]   it's never been true.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.120]   That's sufficient in and of itself as an explanation.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.560]   But there is another one, and it is this.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:08.240]   By the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.120]   Now I have no doubt at all that they are right to say that the "he" there is not referring
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.840]   to the men who claims to believe, it is referring to the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.480]   It is he who is sanctified by the blood of the covenant.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   But you say, how can Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ, be sanctified?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.560]   Well he has answered your question.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:39.120]   You will find that in John 17, in his high priestly prayer, he says, "For their sakes
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.400]   I sanctify myself."
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.920]   Which means he sets himself apart for this work that he is going to do as our great high
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.240]   priest.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.920]   And how was he sanctified?
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.120]   How was the high priest under Israel sanctified?
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.320]   He was sanctified by the blood that was put upon him.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.240]   How is the Lord Jesus Christ sanctified for his work?
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.440]   By the blood that is put upon him, and it is his own blood.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.240]   Now you can't prove this either one way or the other.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.640]   On terms simply of language and of words, it can be either.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.200]   But surely if you take the whole tenor of scriptural teaching together, you will agree
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.360]   with those who say that the "he" here should have a capital "H."
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.720]   And that the "he" who was sanctified is the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.200]   And if so, there is no problem at all.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.560]   But even, as I say, if you reject that, you still have the first explanation that I have
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   put before you.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.880]   Well, very well, what does all this mean?
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.000]   There we've looked at our terms.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.680]   Well the important thing of course to notice is this.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.560]   That all these terms taken all together have a definite limit to them.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:59.160]   Nowhere are we told that these people were born again, that they were regenerate.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.360]   Nowhere are we told that they have been justified.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.080]   Nowhere are we told that they've been sanctified.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.160]   Nowhere are we told that they've been sealed by the Spirit.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.400]   Nowhere are we told that they've been adopted into God's family.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   Why do I emphasize that?
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.880]   Well for this reason, that when the references are to the true believers, you will always
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.640]   find that the terms "justified" and "sanctified" and so on are used.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.880]   Let me give you just one example to prove my point.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   Go to 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and begin to read at verse 9.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.200]   Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.680]   Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.000]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.240]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.680]   And such were some of you.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.520]   But you're no longer that, he says.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.720]   Why are they no longer that?
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.160]   What does he say about them?
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.480]   Does he say this?
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.000]   You are now enlightened.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.080]   You are now tested of the heavenly gift.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.440]   You are now made partakers of the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.360]   You've now tested the good word of God, and you've tested the powers of the world to come.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.720]   No, that isn't what he says.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:25.160]   What he says is this, "But you," he says, "are washed, but you are sanctified, but you
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:32.000]   are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.720]   Or as I could quote you endless, but it comes to my mind as I'm speaking, what Paul says
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:43.920]   to the Ephesians, "In whom also having believed," he says, "you were sealed with that Holy Spirit
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.600]   of promise."
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.200]   You see, that's the thing that he says about believers, that believers are said to be justified,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.000]   to be sanctified, to be sealed.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.160]   "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.480]   sanctification and redemption."
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.640]   These are the terms.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.920]   Not one of them is used here in Hebrew 6.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.680]   And it is indeed the whole answer.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.240]   What we are told about these people is not that they're regenerate, not that they're
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:19.280]   sanctified, not that they're reconciled to God, but that they had had these experiences
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.160]   which had brought them into the church and made them think and made everybody else think
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.120]   that they were truly Christian.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.240]   They had claimed to believe the truth.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.680]   They had had some remarkable experiences in the realm of the church together with the
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.040]   others.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.760]   Some of them may have had even some of these miraculous gifts.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.560]   But as I've shown you, that doesn't prove that a man is a Christian of necessity or
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.320]   that he is regenerate at all.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.440]   Now there is a perfectly adequate explanation.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.720]   Indeed it is the only adequate explanation.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.440]   However you may regard the doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints, and to substantiate
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.960]   it.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.760]   What happened to these people, you see, was something like this.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.840]   They're not unbelieving Jews who've never had anything to do at all with the gospel.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:18.680]   These are Jews who claim to have seen the truth and to have believed it, and were accepted
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.200]   into the church.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.080]   You remember we saw in John's first epistle, chapter 2, 19, that certain people had gone
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.400]   out from among them who'd been inside.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.960]   He says they were not of us, otherwise they'd still be with us.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.500]   But they had been in, they'd been baptized, they'd been received into the membership
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   of the church.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.380]   So had these.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.020]   They seem to be truly Christian.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.520]   But they'd never been truly Christian.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:48.080]   It is possible for the Holy Ghost to carry us to a certain point, and still we've never
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.140]   been regenerate.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.920]   You can have a kind of intellectual understanding of the scripture.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.520]   You can have experiences, you can have pleasure in the scripture.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.600]   It doesn't prove of necessity in and of itself that you're truly regenerate.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:09.760]   Now, as I've often pointed out, the story of revivals throughout the century confirms
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   this to the hilt.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.680]   Whenever you get a greater pouring of the Spirit of God, there are always a number of
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.660]   people who are, as it were, carried in by the tide, and they seem to be truly Christian.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.560]   But you discover later that they've never been Christian at all.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   I know one such instance, he always comes to my mind when I'm dealing with this matter.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.640]   A man who was a young man during the Welsh revival of four and five.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.600]   He was a leader of the revival in his district.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.240]   After the revival, he decided he'd become a minister of the gospel and went to a theological
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   college.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.800]   And very soon, he was denying everything that is essential to the faith.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.360]   He's still doing so.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.400]   But he had extraordinary experiences during the revival.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.560]   Yes, the Holy Spirit can do remarkable things.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:04.620]   Gift of prophecy to Balaam, to Saul, king of Israel, gift of ability and apparent understanding
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.680]   and agreement to Judas and others.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.860]   The Holy Spirit can do many things to us short of regeneration.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.080]   We must never forget that.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:21.320]   There is nothing so foolish and so wrong as to imagine that an unbeliever is a man who
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.560]   has never been touched by the Spirit at all.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   People can be.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   Why?
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   It still happens.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.360]   It happens in evangelistic campaigns.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.600]   People often think they've been converted, who've never been converted, and find out
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.380]   afterwards that they've never been.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.760]   But they thought at the time they were.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.800]   They said they had marvelous feelings.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.480]   They seem to see the truth.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.820]   Everything seemed to be clear.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.600]   And yet they afterwards say, "I've got nothing at all.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   What happened to me?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   What was it?"
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.480]   Well, there are some who would say to them, "It's nothing but psychology.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.920]   It doesn't follow that it's only that.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.400]   It may be.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:44:00.620]   It may be a psychological experience, but it may also be this general work of the Spirit."
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.560]   He does that sometimes.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.800]   And whenever he's acting in great power, there are always these who, as it were, are
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.480]   just carried in, as I put it, by the tide.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.040]   But they've never been Christians at all.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.520]   They've never been regenerate.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.800]   And I would argue that verses 7 and 8 in this sixth chapter of Hebrews rarely proves the
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   whole point.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   "For the earth," he says, "which drinketh in the rain that cometh after upon it, and
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.120]   bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:36.200]   But that, another kind of earth, which beareth thorns and priors, is rejected, and is nigh
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.040]   unto cursing, whose end is to be burned."
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.240]   He says there are two types of earth.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.000]   The same rain falls upon the two, and they both belong to the same master.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.880]   But the results are very different.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   Why?
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.280]   Well, because the earth is very different.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:58.360]   And remember, this is put in as an illustration to illustrate what he's just been saying in
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.800]   verses 4 to 6.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.960]   In other words, he's saying all along, these people have always remained natural.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.480]   They've never been spiritual.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.240]   They've never been regenerate.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.600]   They're like this bad type of earth that beareth nothing but its own natural product, though
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.680]   for the time being it may appear to be Christian.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.280]   They're like, again, the people of whom our Lord will say, "In spite of all they claim
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.600]   and call him Lord, and all they've done, I never knew you.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.280]   You've never belonged to me at all."
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.880]   All these passages confirm one another.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.880]   They all point the same great lesson.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:45.840]   Here, then, is our conclusion that these people have never had any vital change at all.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.480]   They've never become regenerate.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.440]   There has never been divine life within them.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:59.320]   They've just been carried along in this strange kind of partnership with the Holy Ghost for
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.120]   the time being.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:08.480]   They're like the people depicted by our Lord in the parable of the sower, the seed on the
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.200]   stony ground and the thorny ground.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:18.620]   The only ground at Sibeliu is that last one, where there's depth of earth and where it
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.320]   brings forth the fruit.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.800]   And we come to the same conclusion.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   It is only the fruit that finally lets us know.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.640]   This, some of you may think, is a very good argument for not pressing for decisions at
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.560]   the end of a meeting.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.360]   It is the fruit alone that really establishes it.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.280]   But people are given the impression that because they come forward, they therefore are regenerate
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.960]   and are Christians.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.760]   Nobody's in a position to say that.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.360]   This whole phenomenon and possibility show us how dangerous a procedure that is.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:03.040]   It is our business to sow the seed in the power of the Spirit and to know that he alone
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.240]   can give the increase.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:11.200]   And when he does do so, it always shows itself.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.240]   And a man who is regenerate is a man who always comes to somebody to let them know.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.600]   He wants help, he wants to know more.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.400]   You needn't go after him, he'll come to you.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.720]   It's invariably the case.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.400]   Very well, there is the main attitude towards this matter.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:33.160]   But let me finish the exposition by putting it like this.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.360]   What does the author really say about these people?
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.640]   Well, I suggest to you that it proves my contention.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.560]   Now this is where so many go wrong.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.600]   They say, "If they shall fall away," or "falling away."
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   What does that mean?
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.760]   Well, most people seem to think that that means committing sins.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.320]   Ah, but they say in chapter 10 it says that quite explicitly.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:02.400]   If we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, they say that
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.040]   means that you commit certain sins.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.560]   It means nothing of the sort.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:17.040]   Neither of these two passages has any reference at all to the committal of certain particular
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.880]   sins.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.200]   What is he talking about then?
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   Well, it's this falling away.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.880]   Falling away from what?
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.320]   Falling away from the truth.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.920]   It's falling away from the truth that this man is talking about in chapter 6 and in chapter
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   10.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.280]   He's not talking about conduct.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.600]   He's talking about people who once having claimed to believe the Christian message are
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.320]   now denying it.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.000]   They are denying the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.600]   They are ridiculing his shed blood on Calvary's cross as the only blood of atonement, and
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.840]   they're going back to the Jewish sacrifices and the blood of bulls and of goats and the
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.000]   ashes of an heifer.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   He tells you all that in the epistle.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.800]   That's what falling away means.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.160]   So that the kind of person depicted here is not a Christian who happens to fall into some
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.640]   grievous terrible sin.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.080]   I don't care what it is.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.900]   Put murder in if you like.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.360]   That isn't what he's talking about.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.560]   Even a murderer can be forgiven by God.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.880]   These are not people who committed particular sins.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:32.200]   These are people who are denying Christ, trampling him underfoot, regarding his blood as something
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.240]   cheap and profane.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:39.360]   They're denying the essence of the Christian message and doing so deliberately and are
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.920]   pleased with themselves for doing so.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.640]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.400]   That's the point that's at issue here.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.800]   You see he's already said it in chapter 5 and the beginning of chapter 6.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.360]   He says, "For when for the time ye are to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.640]   again which be the first principles."
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   That's the context.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.040]   Here it is at the beginning of chapter 6.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.720]   Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, and principle means elementary
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.240]   principles, the first beginnings of the gospel of Christ.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.800]   Let us go on to perfection.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.960]   We don't want to go back again to lay the foundation of repentance from dead works and
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   of faith to God.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.400]   Now that's what he's talking about.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.680]   He's talking about the first fundamental principles of the gospel.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.360]   And what he's saying here is this.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:34.640]   If a man goes back on those and denies those, he says, "I've got nothing more to say to
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.100]   him."
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.200]   Because what is there to say except the thing that he's rejected?
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.800]   "I've got nothing more to say to him."
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.680]   That's all this man is really saying at this point.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.800]   He has nothing to say to people who have been claimed to understand the gospel go back to
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Judaism.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.680]   He says, "I've no more to say.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.920]   All I can do is to go on telling you about the Lord Jesus Christ and about his death
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.960]   upon the cross and the atonement.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.240]   And if you don't believe that, well I've nothing more to say to you."
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.200]   Now he says, "Let's leave all that alone.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.080]   Those of you who do believe this, let me take you on to perfection."
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.320]   That's the meaning of this passage.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.780]   And nothing but that.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:17.920]   So what he really says about these people is, when he talks about here that if they
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.360]   fall away, it's impossible for them to renew them again into repentance.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.480]   What he's really saying is this.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.000]   That he can do nothing more for them.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.480]   He's even saying that they can do nothing more for themselves.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.400]   But remember that that doesn't mean that God the Holy Spirit can't.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   He doesn't say that.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.920]   There is still that possibility.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.600]   They can't do it, he can't do it.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.360]   But he doesn't shut out the other possibility.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.320]   And I want to say this.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:58.240]   That if there is someone in this congregation who has ever denied this truth, but who now
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.360]   hates himself or herself for having done so, and wants to believe it, I tell you that that's
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.240]   the work of the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.920]   If ever a man wants to believe this, it is always the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.480]   For the natural man never receives it.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.420]   The carnal mind is at enmity against it.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:24.500]   So if any man ever desires to receive it, he can be quite sure that this has nothing
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.000]   at all to do with him.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.760]   That's all he says.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.040]   That when people go back on these first principles, don't want to have anything to do with them,
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:40.480]   but reject them and take pride in doing so, treat it with contemplation and scorn, as
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:47.360]   you see the language in chapter 10 in particular, he says, "I've no more to say to you."
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.480]   Very well then, what is the purpose of these warning passages?
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.720]   I can give it to you in three headings.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.380]   The purpose of these is this.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:07.360]   It is God's way of keeping us all from presumption and antinomianism.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.040]   The danger is, you see, that people get this doctrine intellectually and say, "It doesn't
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.520]   matter what I do."
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.120]   It does matter what you do.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.080]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:23.480]   And these great passages are the passages that warn us against presumption, mere intellectual
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.760]   belief, and the terrible sin of antinomianism.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.320]   They keep us from that.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:38.000]   Secondly, this is God's way, in other words, of ensuring our perseverance.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.160]   It is by warning us that he keeps us to the narrow way.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.760]   It's his way, therefore, of preserving his people, his children.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.280]   Final perseverance of the saints.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.300]   This is one of his ways of doing it.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:56.560]   When the Christian tends to become slack, he suddenly comes up against this, and he's
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.320]   terrified, back he comes.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.120]   God's got another way, and that is chastisement.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.080]   "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth."
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.240]   That's God's way of keeping his people.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.720]   He warns them, he punishes them, he chastises them.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.440]   It's in chapter 12 of this epistle.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:18.200]   It's also in 1 Corinthians 11, in connection with the communion service.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.040]   Because you're not behaving, he says, "Some are weak, and some are sickly among you, and
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   some are even asleep."
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   They're dead.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.780]   He doesn't say they're lost, remember.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:33.900]   What he says is this, that God, because these are his people, is going to bring them to
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.100]   the final glory.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.780]   He'll bring them by terrifying them with these passages.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:45.700]   He'll bring them by chastising them, by punishing them, even sending sickness sometimes,
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.180]   in order to keep them, and in order to preserve them.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:54.200]   It is God's great way of ensuring the perseverance of his saints.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:55:00.860]   He's got another way, the way that the apostle mentions, you remember, in 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.200]   There was that man in Corinth guilty of that terrible sin.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.640]   What he says is this, "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together,
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:15.840]   and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto Satan."
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.040]   That means you're throwing him overboard, does it?
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   He's going to hell.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:26.160]   "To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.400]   may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.840]   He hands him to Satan not to destroy him, but to bring him to his senses.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.200]   When he won't listen to the warnings, when he's headstrong in his antinomianism, Paul
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.920]   hands him over to Satan.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.480]   Satan will deal with him, he'll deal with his body.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.080]   He'll do something to him in the flesh.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.800]   "Yes," says Paul, "I hand him over that he may do so."
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.800]   Why?
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.240]   In order that the man's spirit may be preserved.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.000]   That's the final way of preserving the saints.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.800]   It's a very strange one, but it is one that is clearly taught by the great apostle.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:07.240]   And so my last, third and last comment about it all is this.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:13.840]   The final proof of the correctness of our interpretation tonight is this.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.920]   That the only people who are ever troubled by these two passages are Christian people,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.960]   God's saints.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.280]   Nobody else.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.800]   Your false believer is never troubled by them.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.320]   If he had been troubled, he wouldn't have continued as a false believer.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.400]   The whole point about the false believer is he says, "Everything's all right.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.200]   I took my decision, all is well.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.880]   Don't search me, don't examine me, I don't need that, I'm looking to Christ.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.720]   I never examined myself at all."
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.680]   That's your false believer.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.840]   The false believer is never worried about his soul.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.720]   The false believer never comes to my vestry and says, "You know, I really doubt whether
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.440]   I am a Christian at all.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.880]   I'm beginning to wonder."
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.440]   The moment somebody says that to me, I say, "You're a believer, my friend.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.240]   You wouldn't be worried if you were not."
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.880]   The false believer's never worried.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.960]   The false believer says, "Lord, Lord, haven't we done this, that, and the other?"
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.280]   They're the really busy people in the church sometimes.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.860]   They're never worried, never troubled at all.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:14.120]   And they dislike preaching that is disturbing and causes us to examine ourselves.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:20.520]   The very proof of our interpretation is this, that the only people who are troubled are
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.960]   the saved, the children of God.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.200]   And as I say, God uses that very trouble to preserve them.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.160]   It will drive them nearer to him.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.600]   It will help them to hate sin more than ever.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:38.520]   It will lead them to pray that they may know the sealing of the Spirit in all his abundance.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.600]   Very well then.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.360]   If you are worried and troubled by these passages, take it as proof of the fact that you're
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.180]   a Christian.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.720]   It is a perfect proof of that.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.680]   God's threatenings are always promises to his children.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.360]   It invariably works like that.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.440]   All the threatenings of the Scripture are the promises to the children.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.960]   You see, it works like this.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.140]   He says, "Now those others, this is what I'm going to do to them.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.800]   But of course you are not there.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   What should I do to them?
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   I don't do it to you."
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.000]   But you see, the children, when they hear it, they tremble for a while.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.240]   That's all he means them to do.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.200]   He's not saying he's going to do that to them.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.000]   He's going to do that to these others.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.600]   His threatenings are always promises to the children.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:35.800]   So we come to that final conclusion, that to be concerned and troubled about the state
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:46.880]   of our soul, when we read passages such as this, is in and of itself evidence that we
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.920]   are sensitive to God's Word and to his Spirit.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.560]   That we've got spiritual life in us.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:04.880]   And that our chiefest concern is to know that we are children of God.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.320]   And the only people who want to know and to know for certain that they are the children
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:15.040]   of God, are those who are the children of God.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.320]   Nobody else wants it.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.000]   The people out in the world tonight, they never want it.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.480]   The false professor never does.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.320]   It's only the children who really want to know.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:29.320]   The little child says to you when you've just heard it, "Tell me that you love me."
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   The lover always wants to be told that the one he loves, loves him.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.760]   "Tell me thou art mine, O Savior.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.240]   Grant me an assurance clear."
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.840]   Cries William Williams in one of his hymns.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.760]   "Banish all my dark misgivings."
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   That's it.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   "Tell me thou art mine."
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.200]   That's the cry of a child.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   Invariable.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.920]   It's the child who wants assurance, wants certainty.
[00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:01.880]   It's the child who's unhappy when for some reason or another there is a kind of cloud
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.400]   between him and his father.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.280]   So that I say to be worried and troubled, far from proving that you are reprobate, is
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.400]   a proof that you are not reprobate.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:24.960]   These passages have reference only to the temporary, the false professor.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.360]   Amen.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:37.840]   O Lord, our God, we again come to thee to thank thee for the wonders of thy grace and
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.640]   for thine amazing kindness and love to us.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:50.080]   O Lord, write these things, we pray thee, upon our minds.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:01:00.440]   And then write thy new name upon our hearts, thy new best name of love.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:09.880]   O God, by thy blessed Spirit, make these things plain and clear to all who are in thy presence
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:18.440]   here at this moment and to all others who may be held in the bondage of Satan with all
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.160]   his dark, unhappy accusations.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:30.400]   Lord, help us all so to see this truth, that we can defy him and resist him, be free from
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:38.520]   all his entanglements and insinuations and rejoice in thy love as thy children.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.200]   Amen.
