[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:17.000]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 3, 4, and 5. Verses 3, 4, and 5 in
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.520]   the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:33.280]   But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:43.600]   saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient, but
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.720]   rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.120]   covetous man who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.240]   God.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   We come back to consider these solemn words once more. We looked at them last Sunday morning
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:21.720]   in a general sense. We looked at them as they teach us of the way in which the Church faces
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.160]   moral problems in this present world. But this morning, having done that, we must come
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.560]   back and look at them more in detail and in particular. The apostle himself does that,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.880]   so we must do that, however painful a process it may be.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.880]   The Christian must never be content merely with grasping principles. He must grasp principles,
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.400]   and he must start with principles. So much of the trouble, it seems to me, in the Church
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   today is due to the fact that people do not grasp principles. They miss the wood because
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.920]   of the trees. But it is, on the other hand, equally dangerous to be content with principles
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.960]   only. We are meant first to grasp the principles, and then we are meant to apply them in detail
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   to every action, aspect of our Christian life and living.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   Now, that is something which we must hold in our minds. Every part of our life is to
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.560]   be governed by our Christian principles and by our Christian faith—everything. You notice
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   how the apostle comes down to details, and he covers the whole of life. Or, putting this
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:58.280]   positively, we must never lose sight of the fact that the ultimate object of Christianity
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.640]   is that we should be holy and that we should walk before God blameless in love.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.520]   Now the apostle has told these Ephesians that, at the very beginning of his letter in verse
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.320]   four of the first chapter, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:29.680]   of the world, that in order there we should be holy and without blame before him in love."
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   That is the end and the object of the Christian faith. It is to prepare us to walk before
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   God in this world and to spend our eternity in the presence of God. And if we lose sight
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   of that, well, then our Christianity, so called, is utterly and entirely in vain.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.720]   And what the apostle is doing in this great section is to show these people how they are
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.960]   to become holy and to walk before God in love, in this holiness and in this purity. And therefore
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.240]   it behoves us to look at and to examine what he says. He adopts his usual formula. We have
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920]   seen that from the seventeenth verse in the fourth chapter, that he has got a formula
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.560]   which he always uses, and it is this. He first of all tells us what we must not do, he then
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.720]   tells us what we ought to do, and thirdly, he gives us a reason for all this. He never
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.160]   fails to do that. There are always those three elements—things we must not do, things we
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.920]   should do, and the reason why. We are not treated as children, we are not treated as
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.280]   machines, we are to know what we are doing. And a Christian who does not know why he or
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.120]   she should be living the Christian life is a very poor Christian indeed. If you are fighting
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.600]   against it and do not understand it and wish you had not got to live like this, well, it
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.320]   is just a betrayal of the fact that you have never understood the first principles of the
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.440]   gospel. There is always a reason for everything that we are told not to do, everything we
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   are told to do.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   Very well, let us adopt the apostles' classification. There are certain things which, as Christians,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.400]   we are to avoid and to renounce completely. We are to have nothing to do with them. What
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.720]   are they? Well, let me read to you again this awful, terrible list. Now, let us remember
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:47.200]   this. The apostle here was not trying to reform the world; he was writing to Christians. These
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.080]   words are addressed to members of the Church at Ephesus and other churches. This is not
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   general moral advice to the world outside. These words are addressed to Christians. And
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.320]   therefore we deduce that Christians need such words to be addressed to them, and God knows
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.280]   that is still the case. So this is not, I say, the Church's general moral program in
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.000]   which he can join with the world and the state in trying to clean up society, not a better
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.360]   word. This is addressed to the Church. And these are the things which, as Christians,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:36.840]   we are told that we must renounce and avoid completely and entirely. Most of these words
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.960]   explain themselves and need no comment, but some of them need a little comment. Here they
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:55.520]   are, first and foremost, fornication and all uncleanness. Every form, every type, every
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:05.760]   suggestion of it is to be avoided. Uncleanness. We have nothing to do with it, not only the
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:15.400]   specific thing itself, but all uncleanness. We must work that out for ourselves. How prone
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.480]   we are at times to think that things done in the mind are not as bad as things done
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:28.960]   in actual practice. But all uncleanness, every form and type of it, is just to be banished
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:40.000]   out of our lives. Then we come to the next, which is covetousness. This means, of course,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.880]   avarice, love of money, love of money as money, love of money partly for itself and partly
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:59.240]   because of what it can do for us. The things we can buy with money, the things we can procure
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   with money, the things we can do if we've got money, the love of all that, money and
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.240]   all that money represents and all that money can do and achieve. That's the thing he's
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:18.840]   condemning under the word covetousness. We are to have nothing to do with it. We are
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.320]   to leave it alone. It belongs, he says, to the old life, but has nothing to do with the
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   Christian life. Covetousness.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.680]   Then the next word you notice is the word filthiness. And what's this? Well, it means,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:46.240]   for one thing, obscenity. Anything that is obscene in speech. But it doesn't stop at
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:55.000]   that. It includes everything that is vile or disgusting in speech or in conduct. And
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.080]   it's a good word that the authorized translators have used here. How expressive it is. Filthiness.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.480]   Anything that is filthy or has even a suspicion of filth about it, we are to have nothing
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.520]   to do with it. Anything that is shameless and ugly and polluted. Filthiness.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.600]   It doesn't belong at all, says the apostle, in the Christian life.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:32.440]   Then we come to another one, foolish talking. What does this mean? Well, this means empty,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:46.200]   frivolous, senseless, thoughtless, foolish and sinful talk and speech. Now, it's interesting
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.760]   to notice that he puts that into this list. The other things are so foul and revolting.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:00.320]   But you see, he puts this into the same list, foolish talking. That kind of empty, thoughtless
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.960]   chatter, babbling. That doesn't belong, he says, to the Christian. The Christian's talk
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   must never be empty. It mustn't be senseless. It must never be frivolous. A Christian man
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.080]   should never be a frivolous person. And he should never speak in just a frivolous and
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.960]   a light, vapid, empty manner. It's so typical of the other life, but it's got nothing to
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:35.040]   do with this life. I shall be elaborating that positively in a moment, but I do emphasize
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.800]   the aspect of taking thought. One of the things that should characterize the life of the Christian
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   always is this element of thoughtfulness. I'm almost tempted to say at this point that
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:59.520]   it not only applies to our speaking, but even to our singing. "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:07.360]   Almighty." You don't jig that. You don't rush that. The difference between Christian and
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.400]   non-Christian singing, in a sense, is the element of thoughtfulness. We don't sing tunes,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:20.720]   we sing the words. There are certain things you don't rush. Let singing be bright, but
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.960]   never Christian singing breezy, never jauntily. Now this is a characteristic of the Christian.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   The other people don't think, you see. Their talk is foolish, empty, not considered. But
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   the Christian isn't like that, says the apostle. So all foolish talking is banished out of
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.080]   the life of the Christian.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.440]   And then he comes to another, which he puts with this, which is jesting. We know what
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:02.000]   this is. This is clever, polished, witty talk, which has a harmful and sinful tendency. The
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.200]   original word has got the idea of turning in it. You know the turning of a phrase, the
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:17.440]   clever, sophisticated, witty, polished shafts which such people throw out. Any double meaning,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.400]   any suggestiveness, anything which is ribald or scurrilous in any sense, that's what he
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.200]   means by jesting. And that again, he says, has got nothing to do with the Christian life.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:41.000]   It should be banished altogether. Foolish talking and jesting, which are not convenient.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And then in this fifth verse, he's got this terrible collection of words, "whoremonger,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.520]   unclean person." And again, he mentions the covetous.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:04.240]   Well now then, there are the words. It is no part of the business of Christian preaching
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.640]   to spend too much time upon them. It surely should be enough for Christian people to mention
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.720]   them and just make it certain that we are clear in our minds as to what they mean and
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.820]   what they represent and what they stand for.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:26.200]   What the apostle is saying is this. There are the things that characterize non-Christian
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:35.000]   society. And as we've already seen in chapter four, this is all but a too accurate description
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.880]   of the life of pagans in the time of the apostle. And these Ephesians had been brought out of
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.120]   that sort of life. They were once in it and they'd been living like that. That was exactly
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.440]   how they lived and as they thought, enjoyed themselves.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   And the apostle is just reminding them that to be a Christian just means that you've been
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.000]   taken right out of that. Well then, you don't bring that with you. You're out of that kingdom.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.960]   You're in another kingdom. You're translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.040]   of God's dear son. And what he's saying is this. You don't bring those things into this
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.880]   kingdom. The kingdom's altogether different. Why did Christ die? Wasn't it to purify unto
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.600]   himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works? So he says, "You don't do these things.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.880]   You have nothing to do with them any longer."
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:38.360]   Now that, I say, is the kind of life that is lived where the gospel and its teaching
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:46.160]   are not in control. And need I take the trouble to point out that this kind of thing is becoming
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.840]   increasingly evident in the life of this world today? We must take these things in our own
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.760]   day and generation as the apostle was urging these people in his day to avoid them. These
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.320]   are the things that are still becoming more and more evident and prominent in the life
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:15.060]   of non-Christian people in every class, in the professions, in all circles. It's appalling
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:23.280]   to think of it, but it is perfectly true.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.960]   I remember as a young man being shocked at the kind of thing that could happen amongst
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:41.800]   learned men, even in professional circles. The type of story that was told. One didn't
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.780]   expect it from such people, but one got it. And it is still taking place. This foolish
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:56.400]   talking and jesting, the telling of stories, that horrible phrase, "Have you heard this
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   one?" And how men collect them and take trouble to remember them. The foolish talking, the
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.960]   jesting, the suggestiveness of it all.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.440]   But now the point is, as the apostle says, that all that is to have no place in the Christian
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   life, and yet isn't there a danger of this coming into the Christian life? "Ah, but
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:26.040]   you say they wouldn't tell such ribald, such unclean stories." I know they wouldn't,
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   but the apostle says that foolish talking is not to come in, in any shape or form. And
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.040]   yet how often does it come into Christian work? And it seems to me to be coming more
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.720]   and more into Christian work. Why should it be regarded as an excellent bit of technique
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.640]   for a speaker on a Christian platform to start with a joke? But that's the sort of thing
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.000]   that surely is coming in increasingly. And very often a story is told which hasn't the
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.880]   remotest connection with the gospel, but it's told simply, as we are told, to make contact
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.520]   with the congregation.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.720]   I once took part in an anniversary service in a certain part of this country. It was
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.520]   a great rally. There were about 1,800 people there, and I had to sit and listen to the
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.560]   first speaker, who without any exaggeration, for a quarter of an hour, simply told the
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.600]   people a number of stories. And I couldn't see the remotest Christian application in
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.960]   any one of them, and indeed he didn't even try to apply them. And the people were roaring
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.920]   with laughter, greatly enjoying themselves. That's entertainment, my friends. It's got
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.280]   nothing to do with the Christian life or with the activities of the Christian church. All
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.920]   that is empty, all that is merely meant to amuse or to entertain, foolish talking and
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:57.360]   jesting. There's no place in the Christian life and in Christian conduct and amongst
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.000]   Christian people. And it would be a very good thing if every Christian in this congregation
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.200]   took a resolution never again to introduce that horrible phrase, "Have you heard this
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:15.240]   one?" It doesn't belong to Christianity. Though you may leave off and leave out that
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:21.400]   which was grossly offensive, you're still using the same terminology, the same kind
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.760]   of technique. Christians don't tell stories to one another. They've got something much
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.400]   better to say to one another. That's what the Apostle is saying. Well, very well, there
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:39.320]   are the things then that we are to avoid and to leave alone and to renounce once and forever.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:47.040]   Let me come, therefore, to the second principle. How are we to avoid these things? And the
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:54.640]   Apostle tells us. He, first of all, tells us that on the negative side, and he puts
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:02.720]   the negative first, that we are not to do such things at all. That goes for granted
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.440]   almost, doesn't it? They mustn't be done, any of these things, we mustn't do them.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.840]   But he doesn't stop at that, you notice. He says, "Let it not be once named among
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:19.080]   you." Now, here's the thing we've got to emphasize. You mustn't even mention
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.200]   it. You mustn't hint at it. You mustn't come anywhere near to approaching it. "Not
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.960]   only must you not do these things," says the Apostle, "don't talk about them, don't
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.440]   mention them. They're unmentionable. They shouldn't come in at all, in any shape or
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.840]   form, either in your speech or even in your thought."
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:45.320]   Now, we've got again to work this out in terms of our own modern position. You see,
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.920]   the Apostle was writing in an age when they hadn't got daily newspapers and the wireless
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.080]   and the films and the radio and the television and all the rest of it. And in those days,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:01.000]   you were confined to speech in this matter of propagating such ideas, and thereby leading
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.440]   to sinful action in practice. So he puts it in these terms, "Let it not be once named
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.160]   among you." Don't mention it. Never bring it in anyhow, in any shape or form.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.240]   But now I say, we've got to work this out in a slightly different, indeed in a greatly
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.440]   different context. And if it was difficult for Christian people then, well, what is it
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:30.760]   like now? There is a sense in which it's true to say that it was never more difficult
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.040]   to live the Christian life in its fullness than it is today. I don't mean by that that
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.240]   people are more sinful. They were doing all these things before. But what I'm saying
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.120]   is this, that the Christian is surrounded by all this in a way that he wasn't in those
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.840]   days. It was then mainly a matter of speech. So we must look first at his principle, which
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:21:02.440]   is this. We are to avoid in every shape or form anything that in any way is likely to
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:10.480]   make us do any one of these things. Fornication and cleanliness and all the rest of them.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:18.640]   Now, the whole art, the whole strategy of Christian living is to watch temptation at
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:25.520]   the beginning. If you let temptation get the slightest foothold in you, you're more or
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.720]   less finished. It's the preliminary onslaught that you're to meet. That's why he says,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   "Let it not be so much as named amongst you." If you want to stop doing these things, says
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.920]   the apostle, stop talking about them. And if a man is in the company and he just insinuates
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:46.800]   a remark, "He started a process at once. Now don't do it. Stop it. Cut that off. Start
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.880]   at the beginning." If you watch the beginning, well, then you won't have so much trouble.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   Now that is what makes it so difficult for the Christian at this present time in this
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:06.600]   world. So we must work out this principle. We are to keep clear of everything and anything
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   that in any way does us harm and tends to incline us in the direction of these things
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.400]   that don't belong to the Christian life. So you see, we shall be fighting all along the
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.920]   line from the moment we get up in the morning until we go to sleep at night, because the
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:33.800]   whole world is shouting these things at us. And how does it do so? It does so in its newspapers.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:40.280]   And you start with your newspaper in the morning, perhaps at your breakfast. "Let it not be
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:47.140]   once named among you," says Paul, "yes, but it will be named on the front page probably."
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.440]   Even in days of crisis and difficulty such as this, look at the things that are being
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:58.460]   not only whispered but being shouted at us as if they mattered or were of any importance
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:05.080]   to anybody. But there it is. We have got to avoid it in the newspapers. You have got to
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:11.600]   read your newspaper with discrimination. You have got to avert your eyes from certain things.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.740]   You have got to be abreast with the news. You have got to be an intelligent citizen.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.760]   You therefore must read your newspaper so that you can vote intelligently. But as you
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:28.120]   read, you have got to avoid, avert, keep yourself to the things that matter, and avoid all others,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:37.240]   and discourage them for all you are worth. Magazines, likewise. You look at a railway
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.400]   bookstall and you will see them, and you will see their suggestiveness, and watch people
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:53.760]   buying them. Magazines that by their very title tell you what they are. "For men only."
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.920]   Why for men only? Well, there is something wrong there. And look at the photographs and
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.520]   the advertisements. Avoid them, says Paul. Have nothing to do with them. Leave them where
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:14.720]   they are. Turn your eyes away. Plays, films, things that come over on the wireless, television.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:22.800]   Oh, I needn't keep you, my dear friends. You know what I am talking about. These are the
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.000]   things that are being suggested and whispered. The foolish talking, the jesting, the cleverness,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.360]   the suggestion, the innuendo. Do you want to make the fight more difficult for yourself?
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.560]   Do you think you really can stand up to the devil, and to the lusts that are within you?
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.600]   Well then, do what the apostle tells you. At the end of the thirteenth chapter of the
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.160]   epistle to the Romans, he says, "Make no provision for the flesh." And if you look at things
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.000]   like that and read them, you are making provision for the flesh. And don't be surprised if you
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.120]   all have nothing to do with it. Let them not be so much once as named amongst you. Have
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.760]   nothing at all to do with them. Nip them in the bud. Stop at the beginning. Don't have
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.960]   any interest at all in them. And go on to the books and the novels. And yes, have you
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:24.800]   noticed recently also the biographies? Biographies are being increasingly published, one after
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.120]   another, in which revolting details are being revealed, which are of no value and of no
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.760]   uplift to anybody at all. But there is a delight at the present time in pornography, and people
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.160]   delight in the unsavory and the unseemly. Well, what the apostle is really urging us
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.080]   to do is this. He says, "Have nothing to do with it. Avoid it in total." If there is a
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   suspicion of a lack of cleanliness in the thing, don't look at it. You can do without
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.800]   the knowledge and the information. "Oh," you say, "I'm a student of sociology. I'm
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.440]   interested in this." Well, give up your interest, I say. To the pure, all things are pure. But
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.560]   if you are not pure, even good things can become bad. The whole emphasis of the apostle
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.760]   is that we must have nothing to do with these things. Let them not even be named once among
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:22.200]   you, as becometh saints. Keep as far away as you can from all these things.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   And then he goes on to tell us how to do this positively, because we are not merely left
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.320]   in a negative condition. He says, "Let these things not be once named among you, and then
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.120]   neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient, but rather"—here
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:49.440]   is the positive, what we are to do—"giving of thanks." Now, what does this mean? This
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   he elaborates later on in the chapter, so I'm not going to spend much time on it this
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.680]   morning. He elaborates it in verses 19 and 20, where he says, "Speaking to yourselves
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:07.080]   in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.920]   giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   Christ."
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.120]   Now, let me remind you again that the apostle is here dealing with what happens amongst
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.680]   Christian people in the Christian circle. He is not telling us here how we are to talk
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.780]   and to conduct ourselves with non-Christians. It applies, of course, up to a point there.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:36.160]   But this is specifically how we conduct ourselves amongst ourselves as Christians.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.560]   And you notice that he puts it like this, that we are to give thanks. Not to mention
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.640]   these other things in any way, but rather giving of thanks. What does this mean? Well,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.320]   let me put it in this form. The Christian, you know, is not to be dull. And if you draw
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.080]   the conclusion from what I've already been saying, that I'm just advocating a kind
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:06.440]   of dull, mechanical life, it's quite wrong. The Christian is not to be a dull and a morbid
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:14.400]   and an uninteresting person, not for a moment. He's never to be guilty of jesting and smartness
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:20.520]   and cleverness. No, no. But that doesn't mean that he's got to be dull or pompous
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:26.200]   or uninteresting. No, the Christian is one who is to be giving thanks. Well, that means,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.680]   of course, that he's one who is to express joy and happiness in his life. He's a man
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.920]   who's got a profound sense of gratitude to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ within him.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.360]   He's a man who wants to be giving thanks. So we must get rid of all notions of dullness.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:52.040]   And of course, that is where a false Puritanism has so frequently done harm. There have been
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:59.160]   people who have interpreted this kind of injunction in an entirely and exclusively negative manner.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.320]   And there they are. They don't do things, but they're useless. They're of no value
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.480]   to anybody. They repel people from the Christian faith. The Christian's never meant to be dull.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:17.680]   Giving thanks, as Paul. There is this joy to be evident in the life of the Christian.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.600]   And this should come out in all his conversation, in all his speech, and in all his department.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:31.680]   Well, now, how are we to do this? Well, again, I must start with the negative. There are
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.520]   people who immediately interpret what I've just been saying by putting on a breeziness
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:43.120]   and a brightness. God forbid that we should ever do that. That's as bad as the poor false
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:52.040]   Puritan person. No, no, we must never put on anything. This is to be something that
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.800]   expresses itself inevitably in us, because we're Christians. It's not to put on an inane
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.840]   grin and to be a bright and breezy and cheerful, back-slapping kind of person. I can't imagine
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:12.080]   the Apostle Paul doing a thing like that. No, and neither, let us remember, does it
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:20.680]   mean that we use glib catchphrases and clichés. You know, there's a type of person who, finding
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.480]   this phrase here, which says, "Rather giving of thanks," constantly when you're talking
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.440]   to them, they keep on jutting in the words, "Praise the Lord." Praise the Lord. Now,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.120]   that isn't what is meant by giving of thanks. It isn't catchphrases. It isn't clichés.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:44.240]   It isn't just using expressions which come lightly off the lip. No, no, no, no. It's
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:51.160]   something profound. It is something that expresses the depth of being and of personality. And
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.800]   then a man isn't conscious of it, and he doesn't do it by rote. He doesn't do it mechanically.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.920]   There's nothing mechanical about this Christian life. This is a change of heart. This is a
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.840]   new nature, and it comes out in that way.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.400]   Very well, then, how does it come out? Well, the Apostle, it seems to me, interprets this
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.860]   statement of his own very perfectly in the last chapter of his epistle to the Colossians
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:21.680]   in verse four, in verse six, rather, of the fourth chapter, where he says, "Let your speech
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:29.640]   be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how we are to answer every
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:35.480]   man." That's it. It's this speech that is always with grace, and it's seasoned with
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:42.000]   salt. That keeps the polluting element out of it. So I would interpret it like this,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:52.840]   that the Christian speech must always be thoughtful, as I've been emphasizing. The Christian is
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:32:01.080]   a man who started thinking. So much of the other life is thoughtless, like a bubble.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.240]   But the Christian speech is thoughtful. And another thing that always characterizes it
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.280]   is this, that it's always profitable. People should always feel somewhat better from having
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   spoken to us. They should have gathered something. Not only positive instruction, but coming
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:27.080]   into contact with us ought to do them good. It ought to make them feel better. There's
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:33.000]   something solid about the Christian in his conversation and in the whole of his life
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.360]   and activity. Yes, and I go further. I find nothing here which excludes even an element
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:48.600]   of humor in the conversation of the Christian. But it is always, of course, a humor that
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:56.720]   is under control. It's never foolish talking. It is never jesting. The humor of the Christian
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.320]   is that which is natural, which is inevitable in the man. The Christian is never a man who
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.960]   tries to be funny. That's the thing that must go right out. He never does it simply in order
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.240]   to impress or to call attention to himself or to cut a figure or to be the center of
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.400]   interest in a conversation. Never. The Christian never calls attention to himself. He doesn't
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.480]   monopolize the conversation. The better the Christian, the better he is as a listener.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.200]   But you watch that sort of person in a circle, man or woman, always trying to keep the whole
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.520]   conversation, wanting to be the object of interest and of admiration. That's the thing
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:41.840]   that's condemned, foolish talking and jesting, cleverness, concerned with making an impression.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.960]   Now the Christian should never do that. But if the Christian is given by God a gift of
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:53.840]   humor, let him use it, let it come out naturally. But it will always be controlled. It will
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.040]   never be ribbled. It will never be scurrilous. It will never do harm to anybody. There will
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.840]   be a kind of beauty about it which will be of value and uplifting.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:12.040]   So you see, this Christian is a man who is always to be giving thanks in appearance,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:18.920]   in demeanor, department, conversation, speech. He's a man who always remembers who he is
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.440]   and what he is. He never forgets it. He always realizes that he is what he is by the grace
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.680]   of God. He's a man who's always conscious that he's been delivered out of that old,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:37.800]   evil, filthy life, that life of the world with its glamour and its emptiness. He thanks
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.640]   God he's been taken out of it. And that always comes out in the whole of a man's life, in
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.560]   all he is and in all he says. He's seen through all that. He hates it. He doesn't want anything
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:55.280]   more to do with it. And he doesn't bring into his new life that kind of thing which
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.360]   he used to do there with just a few things left out of it.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.080]   You know, there are certain Christians, I regret to have to say it, whenever I hear
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:12.840]   them speak in public or in private, I'm still made to think that in their old lives they
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:20.120]   would have made excellent comedians. And I feel that that should never be true of a Christian.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.080]   The same kind of language, the same sort of phrase, the same sort of attitude. They've
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.720]   cut out certain parts of it, but the main thing is still there. It shouldn't be in the
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.120]   Christian. He's a new man. And he knows that he's been taken out of that at the cost of
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.320]   the death of the Son of God. He owes all to God and to Christ. And this dominates the
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.040]   whole of his life. And it comes out everywhere in him.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.760]   We're all failures. We're all miserable sinners in these matters, are we not? But this is
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:55.800]   what we should be, says the Apostle. Cut out all that and begin to do this. Let this be
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:02.280]   the great characteristic of your life, so that as people come and talk to you, they
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:08.560]   find something attractive about you. They feel there's something clean and pure, something
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.400]   uplifting, something intelligent and thoughtful, profitable. You're not dull. No, no, you're
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.840]   interesting. There's a charm about you. And they feel that there's an element of praise
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.200]   in your whole life. And they say, "What do they find to praise God? Where do they find
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   it in a world like this? Would that I were like that?" That's how the Christian is to
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   behave, giving of thanks. And there I've considered it mainly in the matter of speech and of conversation.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.720]   But it also comes in in another way. You notice that he's very concerned about this question
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   of covetousness. He mentions it twice. And the Christian is to deal with that positively
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.000]   also. Not only is he not to have this love of money, which, as he tells Timothy later
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   on, is the root of all evil. What a statement! The love of money is the root of all evil.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.520]   Now he doesn't mean money as such and alone, I say. It also includes what money can achieve
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:18.520]   and produce. And if a man loves money in that way, well, it's not surprising if he makes
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:26.240]   some sort of shipwreck in his life. It is the root of all evil. Think of the things
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.680]   that come out of that. Think of the evil and the sin that comes because men have money
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:38.920]   too much. Well, how do you deal with that? Well, undoubtedly, it's here everywhere in
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:45.240]   the New Testament. The way to avoid that particular snare and danger is to put your money to right
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   use. Give thanks to God through your money. Show your gratitude to him by supporting everything
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:00.880]   that belongs to him and his kingdom. That's the way to avoid it. If you feel this thing
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   is worrying you, well, then I say kill it by giving the money in a right course. Now,
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.320]   I'm not saying that a man should give away all his money. The New Testament doesn't say
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.760]   that. Many a man has done that, you know, and that's an easy way out. That's a way of
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.400]   evading the problem. What the New Testament says is this, that we are to be stewards.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.160]   And a steward isn't a man who gives it all away. No, no. A steward is a man who uses
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:30.280]   it in the right way. Doesn't put it to a wrong use, does put it to a right use. He doesn't
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.680]   give it all away. He can't be a steward, then. There's nothing to look after. But this is
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   the way to kill covetousness. To use this to the glory of God as an expression of your
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:49.640]   thanksgiving and praise to God for all that he's done to you, for his sending of his dear
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   son to die for you, and to deliver you out of that old life that was so foul and so evil,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:04.000]   so superficial, so useless, the life of the world.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.760]   Well there is the second thing. We've been told what not to do, we've been told what
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.800]   to do. And then we are told why we must do the negative and the positive. The reasons
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.360]   are perfectly plain, I have but to hold them before you. Here you see in his typical words,
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:25.120]   listen, "Fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   you as becometh saints." My dear friends, we are saints. We are saints. We are saints.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   My dear friends, we are saints. What's a saint? Well, there is nothing that the Roman Catholic
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:47.320]   Church has done which is worse than her misuse of the word "saint." According to that view,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:54.280]   as you know, only certain Christians are saints, and you canonize them, and you say, "Saint
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:01.040]   so and so." It's an utter lie. Every Christian is a saint, every one of us. The letters are
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.840]   addressed to the saints at Corinth, "Saints in all the churches, as becometh saints,"
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   he says, "to all these church members." Every one of us is a saint. Let us denounce and
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   deny that Roman Catholic error, that Roman Catholic lie.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:26.600]   Well what is a saint? Well the meaning of the word is that you're a holy person. A saint
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   is a person that has been set on one side by God for his own pleasure and for his own
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.840]   use. It's the same word exactly as you get in the Old Testament, if you read your books
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.040]   of Exodus and Leviticus and so on, about the holy vessels that were to be placed in the
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.920]   tabernacle and on the altar. They were called "holy vessels." What does that mean? Well,
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.560]   it meant this, that you didn't use those vessels for anything but that. You didn't use them
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.000]   for your ordinary cooking or for your ordinary eating and drinking. Holy, separated, set
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   apart, put there for this peculiar purpose and for God's own use.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.760]   That's what a saint is. And you and I are saints. We've seen already in verse 1 that
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:24.800]   we are dearly beloved children of God. Yes, but we are saints for that reason. We are
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   God's own peculiar possession. He has set us apart for himself, for his own joy and
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   delight, his own pleasure. That's what a saint is. And every single Christian is a saint.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:47.200]   Well says the apostle, realize that you are a saint. Remember who you are. Say to yourself
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.640]   the first thing in the morning. Say it as you're traveling to your office or your work,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.240]   in your car or in the tube or on the bus or whether you're walking or cycling. Say to
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   yourself, "I'm a saint. I'm a separated person. I'm in the world, but I'm not of it."
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   And there are certain things, therefore, which I must never do or even dream of doing. I
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.960]   mustn't look at them.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.640]   And then, you see, he brings it out by these second words, "as becometh saints." And then
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   this other expression, "which are not convenient." What do they mean? Well, what he means is
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.560]   this. He says these things don't become the saint. They don't fit into the saint. They're
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   not befitting. They're not seemly. And here again, the figure, the picture that is in
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:44.600]   his mind is a perfectly familiar one. And we all should see it at a glance. "As becometh
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:52.240]   saints." There are some people who don't address in a manner that's appropriate to who they
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   are and what they are. If you saw a very old lady dressing herself as if she were twenty,
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:06.760]   you'd say it's not becoming. But it isn't becoming.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:14.480]   There is a fitness about things. Certain things go together, certain things don't. You say,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.640]   "Ah, but does that match? Is there a clash in those colors? Are they fitting into..."
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   "As becometh." That's what he's saying. He's using an illustration from the world of dress.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.040]   And he says, you know, these things don't become the Christian. They don't fit in. They're
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:38.960]   not convenient. There's a horrible clash. The man of the world watches a Christian going
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.880]   into a place he shouldn't enter. He says, "Do you see what that Christian man's doing?"
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:51.200]   And even the man of the world is shocked and amazed. Even the man of the world recognizes
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   the hypocrite. He knows that that kind of conduct doesn't fit with that man's profession.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.920]   And so the apostle tells us to realize and to remember who we are, and to be certain
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   always that all we do fits in with, matches what we are and what we claim and profess,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:20.240]   as becometh saints. And then he goes on and condemns covetousness because it is idolatry.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:31.200]   And there is no more terrible or horrible sin than idolatry. It means that you make
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   a god of something, and you worship that god. And he says that covetousness is idolatry.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:45.640]   You'll find that repeated many, many times in the New Testament. But it doesn't matter
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:51.720]   what it is. Anything that you and I tend to set up as the big thing, the central thing
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.440]   in our lives, the thing about which we think and dream, the thing that engages our imagination,
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.400]   the thing we live for, the thing that gives us the biggest thrill, if it's anything but
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.440]   God, it is idolatry.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   And it's for every one of us to examine ourselves. There are people who worship money and what
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:21.440]   it can do and bring and get. There are people who worship status and position. There are
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.680]   people who worship their own brains and ability. There are people who worship their own good
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   looks. It's idolatry. And it is the ultimate sin. There is no more terrible sin. We are
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:43.280]   meant to worship God and to worship God alone, and there is but one God, and he recognizes
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   none other. God forbid that any one of us should be worshipping or giving ourselves
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   to anybody or anything, save the only true and living God.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:09.120]   Well I leave it at that this morning. The apostle has more to say, which is alarming
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:15.440]   and terrifying. We leave it there. That's enough for us. We are saints set apart for
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:22.440]   God, meant to live to him and his glory, to worship and to praise him alone. Let us ever
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.920]   remember that. And remembering it, let us realize that certain things are incompatible
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:34.880]   with that, and that we are to renounce them forever, avoid them and evade them in every
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   way conceivable, and positively live a life which is a constant expression of thanksgiving
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:51.440]   unto God, who has had mercy upon us, and who, while we were yet sinners and ungodly, was
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   a God who gave his only begotten Son, even unto the death of the cross, that we might
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:10.360]   be rescued and redeemed and have a share in his own eternal inheritance. Amen.
