[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   I love and respect my own parents a lot, but not everyone is blessed with parents like
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120]   mine.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.520]   And so we have several related questions in the inbox from adults who are trying to figure
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.720]   out how to honor their parents.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.380]   For many, this becomes more and more perplexing.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.720]   As we grow into adulthood, we see our parents' faults more clearly.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.040]   And in the late teen transition to adulthood, parental authority changes.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.280]   It lessens, and the relationship changes.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   It all leads to various questions like this one.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880]   Can we honor our parents if we don't respect them?
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.520]   The question was put in particularly clear and brief terms by one listener to the podcast,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.720]   an anonymous 20-something listener who says this, Pastor John, "My question is rather
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.880]   simple.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.980]   How can I honor my parents when I don't respect them, or does honoring them assume that you
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.560]   do respect them?"
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.080]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080]   Yes.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.840]   I don't think there is a great difference between the terms honor and respect.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   Respect I think refers most often to our inner assessment of someone's character or achievement,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.620]   while honor more often refers to our various demonstrations toward them in words or behaviors
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.080]   that express our respect.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:31.200]   So I think the real question is, how do we honor or respect parents who without any repentance
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.960]   act in dishonorable and blameworthy ways?
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.020]   That's the question.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.880]   This is a very crucial question, not only because every Christian has to come to terms
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.240]   with the biblical command of Jesus in Matthew 19, 19, "Honor your father and mother,"
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.400]   even though thousands of people have had parents who consistently acted in dishonorable and
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.680]   blameworthy ways.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.000]   But it's also a crucial question because the same issue faces all of us in regard to all
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   people because 1 Peter 2.17 says, "Honor all people."
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.620]   Not just honor your parents, honor all people.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.920]   Love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the King.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.840]   And there are horrible people in the world who have done despicable things all their
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.380]   lives and have died viciously hating people and rejecting God and seemingly having nothing
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.400]   honorable about them.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   Now what I have found to be most helpful in thinking through this question about how to
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   honor the dishonorable is to discover in the New Testament that there are at least seven
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.400]   overlapping warrants or reasons or grounds for honoring someone.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.800]   And these different reasons or grounds for honoring people regularly call for different
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.120]   ways of honoring people.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.480]   If we take all these into account, some of them will apply to honoring parents who have
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   acted in disreputable or criminal ways.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.160]   And we're not going to twist any language to make that work.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.400]   So here they are.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.040]   Here are the seven overlapping warrants for honoring someone in the New Testament.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   First, there is honor that is owing to human beings simply because they are created in
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.800]   the image of God and should be treated differently from the animals.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.880]   For example, James 3.9, "With our tongues we bless our Lord and Father, and with it
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.920]   we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.080]   From the same mouth come blessing and cursing my brothers.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.200]   These things ought not to be so."
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.680]   In other words, the sheer existence of a human being in the image of God, the likeness of
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.320]   God should call forth from us a kind of honor.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.120]   So when my students used to ask me, "How do you honor a child molester, a rapist, a
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.480]   murderer, a leader of a genocide?"
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.840]   One answer was that I gave, "You don't shoot them like a stray ox that gored your
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.080]   neighbor.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   You give them a trial by jury just because they are human and not animals.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.360]   That's a form of honor, even if the trial is followed by execution."
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.960]   Second, there is honor that is simply owing to natural relations as God has established
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.040]   them.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.280]   And here I'm thinking about honor your father and mother, because it is a natural
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.760]   relation that God has established and gains its honorableness from his ordering of things,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.600]   not just from the quality of the parents.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.800]   Or you could add to that the honor that is due to age.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.960]   Leviticus 19.32, "You shall stand up before the gray head and honor the face of an old
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.240]   man, and you shall fear your God.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.320]   I am the Lord."
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.960]   Third, there is the honor that comes with God-ordained authority.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.880]   Now, that overlaps with the second point, but this one is not rooted in nature the way
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.300]   that was.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.720]   In the secular sphere, Peter says, "Honor the king," 1 Peter 2.17.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:00.880]   In church, Paul says, 1 Thessalonians 5.12, "Respect those who labor among you and are
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.040]   over you in the Lord."
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.200]   In other words, there is a God-appointed authority in the world and a God-appointed authority
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:18.040]   in the church, and there is a kind of honor that we should show just by virtue of the
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.600]   roles of authority that God himself has appointed.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.000]   Fourth, there is the honor that people should get because of the worth of their work.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.640]   In 1 Thessalonians 5.13, Paul goes on to say that in the church we should "esteem our
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.840]   leaders very highly in love because of their work."
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.320]   In other words, the work itself is valuable and worthy of our respect.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:02.400]   Fifth, it's interesting that Paul mingles love with honor there in 1 Thessalonians toward
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.520]   the church leaders who do their work well.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.920]   Here's verse 13 again.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.040]   "Esteem your leaders very highly in love because of their work."
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.440]   In other words, there is a kind of respect or an esteem or an honor which is drawn out
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:31.080]   of us by our love for those who serve us, not just from the quality of their work.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   Sixth, there is an honor that should be drawn out toward weakness.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.800]   Peter mentions this in relationship between husbands and wives in 1 Peter 3.7.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:54.320]   "Husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   vessel."
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:05.200]   In other words, in Christ, the response toward weakness is not exploitation or mockery or
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.160]   abuse, but honor.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.760]   Seventh, and this may be the most important with regard to what is distinctly Christian,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:24.680]   there's a kind of honor that is freely bestowed without reference to any quality or position
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.520]   or reputation or virtue or rank or demerit in the person honored.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:40.600]   In other words, there is a way of honoring which, as it were, doesn't respond to honorableness
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.640]   but bestows it.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   It treats a person as though honorable, as though worthy of our service because we give
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.000]   it to them.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.960]   Paul roots this way of honoring people in the very mind of Christ and in his sacrificial
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.120]   incarnation and sacrifice on the cross.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:13.840]   Philippians 2.3 starts like this, "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.360]   Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.780]   in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.760]   himself taking the form of a servant."
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:42.680]   So there is a kind of honoring that we freely and graciously bestow on the undeserving.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.840]   We treat them better than they deserve.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:55.720]   We assume the position toward them of servants and thus, in a way, exalt them as though they
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.300]   were worthy to be served when in fact they're not worthy to be served.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:08.080]   And thus we bestow a kind of free honor upon them, which is called grace, the way Christ
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   did to us, the way his sacrifice pours out on us.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.240]   Honor as though we were honorable when we're not.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.800]   None of those seven reasons for honoring people and none of those ways of honoring people
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:32.280]   commit us to the hypocrisy of thinking someone is honorable when they are dishonorable or
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   praiseworthy when they are blameworthy.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.880]   The Bible does not ask us to live a lie.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:47.900]   So in summary, some acts of honoring others are owing to the image of God, some to natural
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:53.640]   human relations that God has appointed, some to authority structures that God has put in
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.200]   place, some to the worth of their work that others do, some to a person's weakness, some
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:08.640]   to the relationship of love that we have, and some is absolutely free in order to display
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.920]   the freedom of the grace of God to others.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:23.040]   And among those seven, I would say at least four and possibly as many as six apply to
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:32.800]   parents who at one level have lived in dishonorable ways, and I'll let you think through which
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.600]   of those apply to your situation.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   That's a great gospel connection here, Pastor John.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Thank you.
