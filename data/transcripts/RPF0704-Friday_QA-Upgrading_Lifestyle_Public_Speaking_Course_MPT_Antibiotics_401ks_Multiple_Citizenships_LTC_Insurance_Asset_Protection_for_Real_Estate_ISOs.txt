[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.960]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we again do live Q&A.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.160]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.920]   Today we do live Q&A.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.840]   This is basically part two of the live Q&A show.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.520]   Created generally I restrict these shows to patrons of the show, but today I open it up
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.200]   to listeners who are on the email list and so we've got a couple dozen callers on the
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.040]   line and we continue in just a moment.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.860]   Remember that if you ever want basically guaranteed access to a live Q&A show, you can do that
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.240]   by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.880]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance and you'll get basically guaranteed access to
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880]   the show there.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   I had about 50 callers.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.660]   The reason I do that is because it helps me to meter out the number of callers.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.960]   On today's show I had about 50 callers that came in with a general advice, about 20 or
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.920]   so of them, 25 of them, 20, about 20, made it in in time and then I locked the conference
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.440]   and we've just had lots of people turned away.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.040]   And that's one of the reasons why I use the Patreon program because it helps me with those
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   people who are willing to send a few dollars a month.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.380]   It helps me to be able to serve them effectively without being overwhelmed with callers.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.380]   But today is your lucky day.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.000]   We've got open phone lines.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.920]   So Brandon in Michigan, welcome to the show.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   You're up next.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   Hi Joshua.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   I really appreciate you taking my call.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.680]   How are you today?
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   Very well sir and you?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   I'm doing well.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.400]   I'm hoping you can help me walk through a few things.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.960]   So by way of background, I just turned 25.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   I make around $75,000 a year and I have $10,000 remaining in student loans.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240]   I purchased a single family house two years ago with the intent to house hack for a few
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.440]   years, buy another house, rent the first property and then repeat that strategy into financial
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   independence.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.120]   So in my four bedroom house, I had three roommates, actually college buddies for the first year.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.320]   Now I'm down to one roommate who's covering half of my mortgage payments, but is moving
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.200]   out in the next 12 months.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought the house, when it came to repairs,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.800]   maintenance, that kind of thing.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   But I knew the math made sense and I feel I learned a lot about my local rental market
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.980]   and what work is required in general, but I'm not positive I'm ready to continue growing
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680]   or buy another place yet.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.520]   So I'm conflicted because the math makes sense for me to continue my initial plan.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.880]   So buy another place, rent it out, rent out the first place and continue.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   But I'm also at a point in my career where I'd like to spend more time developing my
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.760]   profession while also spending meaningful time with family and friends, taking vacations,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.120]   etc. while I'm relatively young.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   So I'd really like to hear your thoughts.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   If you have, I guess your thoughts, if you were in my shoes or what things you think
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   I should be considering going forward.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.320]   Yeah, I appreciate it.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.240]   How much is your monthly mortgage payment?
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.200]   Say $1,000, make it simple math.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.520]   How much did you pay for the house?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.760]   $155.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   How much could you sell it for today if you put it on the market?
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.160]   Based on the most recent, like, in the range of, I'd say $170, I think.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.480]   And how long have you lived there?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.800]   Just about two years.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.880]   Why have you not rented out the other two bedrooms thus far after the other roommates
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.800]   left?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.520]   So the idea of house hacking, you know, sounds great and it was financially.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.440]   But after, you know, graduating out of college, I was kind of done with the college lifestyle.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   So you know, just little things like that with roommates that, you know, can drive you
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   up a wall.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.760]   So that was the primary reason I was content with having each one drop and then, you know,
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.280]   I was, you know, more peace in the house.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.480]   So I figure I'd be paying rent anyway, like most people.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.960]   So the fact that I have half of it covered now is okay.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.880]   But with my roommate moving out, you know, in about a year, I figured it would be a good
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   time to, if I were to make the move, it would be now, rent out the house entirely and then,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   you know, continue.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.120]   So the problem that you're facing is you're not trying to make a financial analysis.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.720]   What you're trying to do is justify to yourself a fancier lifestyle.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.060]   Which if you want to, of course you can.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.120]   But it's not a financial question.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.480]   But you're just simply trying to find a way to live a fancier lifestyle.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.020]   You want a fancier lifestyle with fewer roommates.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.620]   You don't want as many people in your house.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.440]   You want more personal space.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.700]   You're tired of living like a college student being crammed forward to a little house and
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.380]   you want a little bit of space.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.940]   You probably want your house just how you want it.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.480]   You want the decorations just how you want them.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   These are all lifestyle decisions though.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   Basically they're all a matter of you saying, "Hey, this is how I want to live."
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.840]   When you talk about wanting more time, you're not trying to get more time so that you can
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   make more money.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   You did say focus on your career.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.360]   We'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.760]   But you're just saying, "I just want to work less.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.040]   I want to have less time with work.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.160]   I don't want to always be managing my rental house.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   I don't always be working in my career.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.080]   I want more time."
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.200]   This is a lifestyle decision and not something that is financial.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.800]   The only thing that you mentioned that is financial would be your career.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   You have the ability to focus on your career and could you increase your income significantly
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   by focusing on your career.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.280]   But you're going to have to decide how much do I want to be rich, how much do I want to
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.360]   be rich fast versus how much sacrifice do I want to make in terms of lifestyle.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.960]   People who become rich quickly are generally those who sacrifice in terms of lifestyle
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.120]   by going ahead and getting two more roommates or figuring out another solution that helps
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   them to satisfy the problem, to make it sufficient where they're willing to do with it.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   Or they're people who generate such a massive income that they can satisfy their lifestyle
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.420]   needs and goals while still getting rich quick.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.840]   Those are really the only two paths I see.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.040]   So the income one is certainly the way that you can increase lifestyle and increase your
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   wealth building ability.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.680]   I teach a whole course on career and income planning and the thing that I always point
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.400]   out is if you want to double your lifestyle and you want to double your savings, the only
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.660]   way to do that is by increasing your income.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.880]   And so if you sit down with your career and you say, "You know what?
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   I really want to have," you look yourself in the mirror and you say, "Brandon, I'm sick
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   and tired of living like a college student.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.640]   I want to have a nice house.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.840]   Not only do I want a four-bedroom house, but I want a fancier four-bedroom house.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.480]   Not only do I not want only one roommate, I want no roommates.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   I want the entire house for myself.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   I want to turn one of my bedrooms into a movie theater.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.360]   I want to turn one of my bedrooms into a guest room.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.160]   I want to turn one of my bedrooms into my computer room and I want to have my other
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.140]   bedroom just my sanctuary."
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.400]   Well, you could do that, but you're not going to get rich unless you massively increase
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.640]   your income.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.360]   And so if you can go from $75,000 a year to $275,000 a year, then you can increase your
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.080]   lifestyle and you can increase your savings, both.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.400]   But if you're just going to keep it $75,000 a year and say, "Well, I'm making $75,000
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   a year and I'll get little 3% raises, etc."
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.020]   Then you're not going to get rich that way.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.140]   And so you have three choices as I see it.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:35.100]   Choice number one is you can say, "My income is probably going to stay about like it is
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.560]   and I'm going to keep just little increases, etc.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   And I want to get rich quick.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.400]   And so in order for me to get rich quick, I'm going to give up lifestyle.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.920]   And so no, I don't love living with three roommates, but I'm going to go ahead and do
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.660]   it and I'm going to stay on the original plan."
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.320]   Because that plan will help you to get rich fairly quickly even with a $75,000 income.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.480]   It'll work.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.360]   Number two is you could say, "I want a nicer lifestyle, but I also want to get rich quick,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.720]   in which case I've got to figure out how to make more money.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.640]   So I've got to move from a career where I'm making $75,000 a year to making $275,000 a
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   year.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   And so how can I do that?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.260]   I'm 25 years old.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.920]   How can I by the age of 30 with what I have, how can I set a target to be making $275,000
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.120]   by the age of 30?"
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.960]   But if you do that, if you increase your income, then you can also then justify the increases
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.120]   in your lifestyle and you can become rich quick.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.920]   Or choice number three is you can say, "I don't want to do the hard work necessary to
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   increase my income.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   I don't want to change.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.040]   I don't want to do those kinds of jobs.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.960]   I'm comfortable where I'm at.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.280]   I want to have a nicer lifestyle and what I'll give up is I'm just going to give up
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.480]   getting rich or at least getting rich quick.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   I'm going to live in a nice house.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.280]   I'm going to pay my mortgage off for a long time.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.600]   I'm not going to have any roommates or I'm going to sell this house and just move into
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.320]   a studio or whatever other living arrangement you have and I'm going to be content with
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.640]   getting rich over 40 years instead of over 10."
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.840]   But those are the three choices that I see that you have.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.640]   I think I kind of need to hear that too.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.960]   So yeah, I appreciate it.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.400]   What I would do if I were in your shoes would be I would suck it up on the roommate situation.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.000]   I see no reason why – are you married, Brandon?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Are you single?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Are you married?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.040]   I had a single girlfriend for a year and a half.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.160]   So that's something that's on the horizon.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.960]   Well if you get married then of course things change and you got to do that but I would
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.480]   recommend that you make that decision separately and if I were in your shoes I would say number
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.000]   one, I'm 25 years old.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's ridiculous for you to be complaining about lifestyle at 25 years old if you care
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   about wealth.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.560]   Now, you complain all you want but if you care about wealth it's ridiculous for you
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.320]   to be complaining about lifestyle.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.760]   I wish that I had been far more hardcore at 25 and I was pretty hardcore but I wish I
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.120]   had been far more hardcore.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.440]   I wish I had worked a lot more than I worked.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.920]   I wish I had invested a lot more than I invested.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.120]   I wish I had lived a lower lifestyle than I lived.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.000]   You can do a whole lot of things when you're 25 years old and single that are a lot harder
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   to do when you're 35 married with children.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.780]   And so I wish I had worked harder and I worked harder than most people.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.080]   But at this point in time if I were going back, if I were 25 years old I would be working
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.400]   70 to 80 hours a week.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.880]   I would be living in one bedroom of the four bedroom house or I would probably have an
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.200]   RV parked out and I would rent out the fourth bedroom because once you see how quickly you
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.920]   can achieve that breakout trajectory when you work hard and you develop your own businesses
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.160]   and you develop your income and you keep your expenses and you do a whole lot of investing
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.040]   fast you're five years away from financial freedom with the right moves.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.320]   And if you go to any 30 year old or 35 year old and you ask them and you say, "Listen,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.760]   if you had the choice to be financially independent at 30 with five years of hard work, if you
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.680]   were to go back and do that over again would you do that or would you take more time off
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   on the weekends and go fishing or whatever your fun thing is?"
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.000]   Now you can do both but you don't need to do both that much.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.060]   You can still put in 70 hours a week and take Sundays off and Friday nights off.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.040]   You can still do that easily and not be overwhelmed and not hurt your health and not hurt your
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.560]   social life, etc.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.160]   There's so much time that you are wasting day after day after day that you're not paying
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.420]   attention to.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   And that's the key.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.480]   If you learn how to harvest that time and stop wasting that time you can have a very
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.800]   satisfying very rich social life.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.280]   You can have plenty of time to rest and rejuvenate but you can also be extremely productive.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.160]   But it will never in your life be easier for you to be financially productive and physically
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.820]   productive and personally productive than it is right now.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.780]   When you start adding on the responsibilities of a wife, of children, all of a sudden it
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.920]   becomes much much different.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.840]   Every single night I put my children to bed at 7 o'clock.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.000]   Then I have the choice.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.140]   Do I go to the computer and do I work more or do I go and spend time with my wife?
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.280]   Every single night.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.120]   Now 98% of the time I look at it and say, "Well, Joshua, you didn't get it done.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.280]   Go and spend time with your wife."
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.760]   That's more important than work.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.620]   But when I go back, when you go back in 25 there's no reason to do that.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.280]   You can do easily work 12 hours a day, 8 hours a day for someone else and 4 hours a day for
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.900]   yourself and still have plenty of time.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.900]   You still have 4 hours.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.080]   If you work 12 hours a day and you sleep for 8 hours that still leaves you with 4 other
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.260]   hours that you can have for socializing, etc.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.140]   And so there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't at this point in your time be
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:35.220]   working 12 hours a day if you are prioritizing wealth, if you're prioritizing building something
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   large.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.000]   But as the people in your life start to grow and you start to have more responsibilities
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.980]   to them then it becomes different.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.980]   Same thing happens in the morning.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.940]   I get up early but my children also get up early because I put them to bed at 7 o'clock.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.840]   So that gives me and my wife time in the evening but now in the morning then my children get
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   up.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.980]   So let's say I get up at 5 a.m.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.700]   I have no more than an hour before my children are up.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.940]   Well now when my children are up do I ignore them and do I say, "No, I'm not going to spend
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.940]   time with you.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.500]   No, I'm not going to be with you and I'm just going to go and work."
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.660]   Well sometimes I do.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.360]   But for the most part you look at them and say, "No, I can never get these years back."
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.500]   And so I guess what I want to impress upon you is you live your life however you want
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.500]   but I wish that I had worked a whole lot more when I was 25, a whole lot more when I was
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   20.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.060]   I wish that I had taken some of those sacrifices because when you can sacrifice for five years
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.060]   and it fundamentally transforms the course of your life for the next 50, that's worth
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   doing.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.020]   And you can do it without becoming a workaholic.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.860]   You can do it without sacrificing important relationships.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.760]   But I would emphasize that if you don't want to live the way you're living, the answer
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.220]   is make more money.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.420]   There is no reason in the world that you should not be making $275,000 a year right now.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.500]   There are plenty of 25-year-olds who've done it.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.220]   But what I would guess is you probably never set that as a goal and you probably never
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.340]   sat down and said, "How can I do it?"
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.180]   And so if you don't like how you're living, fine, go make more money.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.740]   And if you go make more money, a lot of your problems will be solved.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.100]   You'll have new problems but a lot of your problems of lifestyle versus getting rich
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   will be solved.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.940]   Yeah, I think that's spot on.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.420]   I really appreciate it.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.660]   That's awesome answer.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660]   Thank you.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.260]   We'll keep up the good work of where you're even at right now and then check back in the
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260]   future and let me know.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.260]   All right, we go to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.260]   Welcome to the show.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.260]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.260]   Hey, Gordon Josh, working here.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.260]   Okay.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   Sounds great.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.260]   Go ahead.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   Awesome.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.700]   After a couple of months of engaging in Toastmasters Weekly, I observed really just that week my
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.940]   personal communication skill set is.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.300]   This is regarding questions for a Deb Cawdee training course.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.180]   It's a 12-week course, three hours a week.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.100]   I've heard mixed reviews about it.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.820]   However, as recommended by a trusted mentor, throughout your years of working with people,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.140]   what are your thoughts on the course and possibly might get the employer education reimbursement
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.180]   for the course?
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.620]   How much money do you earn every year?
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.580]   $80,000.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.260]   How many hours per week do you work every week on average, ballpark?
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   55.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.780]   55, you said?
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.780]   Yes.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.780]   Okay.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.380]   How much will the Dale Carnegie course cost you in terms of the tuition?
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.380]   $1,800.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.580]   Okay.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.180]   How many hours is the commitment per week and for how many weeks?
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.980]   12 weeks, three hours, 36-hour total commitment.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.500]   So it's three hours for 12 weeks.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.100]   So we do the math on this.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:48.860]   2% of your income is 2% of your income.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:55.940]   So the first way that I would answer that question is if there's something in my life
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.680]   that I think could solve a problem that I've identified that I have.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.060]   You identified a problem.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.420]   I've realized how weak my personal communication skills are.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.660]   And if it's a problem that is that foundational and if you could possibly buy a solution to
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.580]   that problem for a mere 2% of your annual income, to me that sounds like pretty much
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.180]   a no-brainer to just do no matter what.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.060]   The thing that annoys me deeply is when people have potential solutions to their problem
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.180]   that can be solved with relatively low amounts of income and then they don't just simply
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   take action.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.180]   I'm not griping at you.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   I'm just trying to point this out.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.060]   The thing that has always been the most effective and helpful for me has been to invest into
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.220]   myself.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:46.060]   And so you'll have – I've for years consulted with people who will spend $50,000 on a college
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.700]   degree, but then they get out of college and they have the opportunity to take an $1,800
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.580]   course and they'll hem and they'll haw and they'll stumble and they'll wonder,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.580]   "Should I do this?"
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.180]   They have the opportunity to go to a $2,000 conference or a $1,000 conference and they'll
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.700]   just think and, "Well, I'm not so sure."
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.140]   And all of a sudden it's like, "Don't you realize that this is what's powerful?"
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.140]   And the information, the skills that you could develop from an $1,800 course are probably
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   far more valuable than a $50,000 college degree for many people.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.820]   So it's a relatively low amount of money.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.200]   It's a relatively low investment of time.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.860]   So if you're convinced that there's a decent chance that it might help you with a problem
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.860]   that you've identified, then you should do it because your best investment is going
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.520]   to be into yourself.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.440]   Now that's my first answer is based upon the money of it.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.780]   My second answer is I don't know.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.700]   I've never taken the Dale Carnegie course.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.860]   I've read not all but several of Dale Carnegie's books.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.380]   I respect and admire the Dale Carnegie organization.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:51.020]   I would bet that it's probably pretty good and I would bet that the ratio of how good
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.700]   it is is based upon how much a student puts into it.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.980]   When I was in college, if you had asked me after my first two years of college how much
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.460]   I was getting out of my college degree, I would have given you a terrible scathing review
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.580]   of my college.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.500]   I would have told you that the school stinks.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.420]   I would have told you that the professors don't know what they're talking about.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.940]   I would have told you that the education was mediocre and I was deeply unimpressed.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.620]   Then for me, I went away in my junior year.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:26.300]   I studied abroad and that study abroad process was a catalyst in my life.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.580]   First I met professors that impacted me deeply, that challenged me, that overcame my arrogance
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.820]   and showed me that I should shut up and listen, that also started a spiritual journey that
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.380]   I had previously not engaged in.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.060]   Then the following summer I came back to school but at that time I was working hard and I
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.580]   had decided that I wanted to work hard in class.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.260]   Like what I did in the first two years for my summer, fall and then spring semester,
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.140]   I actually invested.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.700]   I actually did my readings.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.460]   I actually came to class prepared.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.820]   I studied in advance.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.980]   I studied for the test, etc.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:03.060]   When I left my senior year, the amazing thing was that my school was totally different.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.300]   The professors that I'd known previously, but all of a sudden the professors went up
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.180]   and they became a lot smarter.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.380]   They became a lot more useful to me.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.860]   The books were a lot better chosen for those senior level courses and my entire college
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.140]   experience changed.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.340]   It should be obvious to you that nothing about the college experience changed.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.060]   I changed and I became a dedicated, motivated student.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.120]   My bet, although I've never looked up reviews on Dale Carnegie's courses, etc., my bet is
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.940]   if you actually went and talked to those people, you would go and find that 50% of the students
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.220]   really invested in the course.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.220]   They took it seriously.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.980]   They did their work, etc. and they got great benefits out of it.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.340]   50% of them didn't.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.940]   I've observed that at all kinds of events, all kinds of classes, that it's you who makes
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.220]   the difference, not necessarily the course itself.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   That's my second answer.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.820]   The first answer was it's a small amount of money compared to if you could solve a problem
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.660]   that you've recognized in your own personal skill level and you recognize that that could
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.780]   have a deep impact on your life and your career going forward, that's a small amount of money
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.380]   to pay for a solution.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.180]   Number two, the Dale Carnegie course is probably fine and chances are if you apply yourself,
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.180]   you would probably get a great experience out of it.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.500]   Then my third answer for you to consider, if you're already in Toastmasters, I don't
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.820]   know why you would need to go and duplicate that with Dale Carnegie because Toastmasters
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.580]   will help you to develop communication skills and if you're already there, it's certainly
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.380]   cheaper and there are plenty of opportunities.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.580]   And so if you like Toastmasters, I don't know why you would need to go and do Dale Carnegie
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.580]   right now.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.420]   What I would encourage you is dedicate yourself to Toastmasters and really get everything
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.780]   you can out of Toastmasters.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.740]   Do the speaking track and also do the leadership track and work your way through that.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   It'll cost you less and if you've got a decent club or a decent region, etc., there should
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.700]   be opportunities for you to improve that.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.220]   And then before you go and buy a course, then at least make sure you've tried a little bit
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.340]   with books.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.640]   Before you buy an expensive course, you should probably start with books, podcasts, etc.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.820]   You're not going to get the same experience that you would get in a course but in terms
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.260]   of trying to be prudent with your money, I generally think that before you start buying
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.020]   courses, you should start with books, you should start with self-study and then after
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.340]   you've applied those things, then you move to courses because they're probably a better
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.940]   use of the money especially for a beginner.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.020]   Where I think courses and coaches really help is after you've mastered the basics of the
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.980]   field and you're convinced that you really need more help but most of self-improvement
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.620]   comes down to practice.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.420]   And so if you buy a book on communication skills or five of them and you start practicing
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.340]   and especially if you have a context like Toastmasters to practice, do that for six
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.260]   months and then after six months, reevaluate and then see if you think you've really gained
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.740]   value from the Dale Carnegie course.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.620]   So if you do it, I'm fine with it but I wouldn't necessarily start with it since you already
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:53.460]   have Toastmasters and you've recognized the need to start with books and opportunities
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.900]   to practice in your personal life.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.900]   That's my answer.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   My pleasure.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.900]   All right, we move on back to Florida, Tampa, Florida.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:03.900]   Welcome to the show.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   Doing well, sir.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   Go ahead.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   All right.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   So I'll say my question and I'll give a little context.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:26.300]   Is it possible to be a financial advisor when you don't really like modern portfolio theory?
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.780]   I've worked in the industry for about a decade now.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:34.500]   I've done some basic financial planning, trading, now I'm in compliance.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.540]   I love having these conversations and talking about products and all that and I've always
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.940]   thought about one day I'd become an advisor but as you've talked about a lot, the way
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:53.940]   they get paid and issues with modern portfolio theory, I don't know if there's a way to do
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.420]   it and I'd be curious to get your thoughts on it.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:04.260]   Do you have a specific style of investing that you believe in or that you have practiced
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.900]   yourself, that you really like?
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:15.780]   I'm pretty compelled by Nassim Taleb's barbell strategy which also sounds familiar to your
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.140]   advice on don't just throw it all in the stock market but go find your passion and get good
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.180]   at something like that.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:31.900]   And then also learning more about different insurance products, they seem to, they get
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:40.260]   so specific and can fit a lot of situations better than some stock asset allocation.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:46.060]   When you say insurance products, do you mean investing insurance, options, etc. or do you
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.460]   mean actual like life insurance products?
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.580]   Both.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.580]   So short answer is yes, I do think it's possible and I think that it's more possible today
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.220]   than it's ever been.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.240]   The pathway in is a little bit more difficult.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:08.060]   So if you believe in modern portfolio theory, there are any number of investment firms that
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.940]   you can join and that you can learn.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:19.340]   And the challenges you should see as is obvious based upon your experience in the marketplace,
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:25.700]   the challenge of the modern world of financial advice is it's an interesting mix of investment
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.620]   management, financial planning and sales.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.060]   And used to be when I would mentor young financial advisors, I would talk to them about kind
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.740]   of three different positions in the marketplace.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.600]   And I would say position number one is investment management.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.140]   If you're really into investment management, portfolio management, you're going to have
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.340]   to look hard for a job that involves you just simply managing investments and there's going
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.580]   to be very little client facing time in that.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.860]   Right now as I'm recording the show, I'm providing basically a version of financial advice, but
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.080]   I don't know what's happening with the market.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   But this is something where right now as I record this on Friday, February 28, 2020,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.580]   the market is in shambles and every single this entire week has been a major down week.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.860]   And so I can't effectively monitor an investment portfolio if I'm with a client.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.020]   And so you ideally want your investment managers in many cases just to be working on the portfolio,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.180]   and not to be worrying about a client.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.340]   Number two area is client facing financial planning.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:35.420]   And so this is a very different function than investment management.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.460]   Financial planning involves talking to the client about their goals, reviewing their
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.140]   portfolio, doing things like tax analysis, looking at their investments, etc.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.340]   But that's different than managing a portfolio.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.660]   And then what I used to say to people in the marketplace was the third thing is simply
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.540]   kind of a support function that you can go if you don't want to sell, if you don't want
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:00.740]   to manage portfolios, or if you don't want to sell, which is what client financial planning
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.220]   is, it's a form of selling, then you can find a support role and kind of like what you're
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.220]   doing, you're working in compliance.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.460]   And so you have a nice salary for managing the financial advisors and making sure that
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.260]   they're compliant with everything that is out there in the marketplace.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.540]   So the point is that these are different functions, and you're going to wind up in a different
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.100]   firm in a different job based upon these functions.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:27.460]   Now you can do at bigger firms, the roles are relatively clear cut.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.480]   In smaller firms, you have the opportunity to be hired into a certain role.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:38.060]   So you can be hired as a producer, as a financial planner and a producer into a firm that doesn't
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.780]   hold the modern portfolio theory if you can find out where that firm is and how they market
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.020]   themselves.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.340]   You could also be hired as an investment manager at one of those firms if you can demonstrate
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.780]   your experience.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.340]   And so I would say yes, it is possible.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.180]   And the first thing I would do is if you want to dip your feet into it, find a position
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.740]   that gets you closer to the actual management of investments than your current position
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.820]   does.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:08.140]   So whether you're a junior analyst at some large firm, whether you – that's a supporting
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.940]   role but it starts to pave the way for you to actually establish your investment bona
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.700]   fides, it provides you with the ability to start to move your career in that direction.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.820]   Or if you want to become a financial planner, then look for a firm that already has that
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.540]   philosophy and it's going to be a lot easier for you to just simply join a firm that has
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.460]   a philosophy that's built upon Taleb's barbell strategy or built upon something that
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:37.300]   you believe and just join them as a producer and I think that would be workable.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.500]   In today's world, it is very possible for smaller boutique firms to survive and I think
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:48.020]   that as modern portfolio theory has become the mainstream juggernaut, there are a lot
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.780]   of people who just simply don't trust the mainstream advice and who are looking for
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.500]   another voice.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.360]   And so in today's world, you don't need that many clients and it's easier than ever
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.220]   to break through with a specific message.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.980]   So you ask me do I think it's possible?
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.640]   My answer is yes and I would just start moving more in that direction with whatever opportunity
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   you can find.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.200]   You'll find it a lot easier to figure out the right solution if you're working as
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.880]   a junior portfolio manager at a firm that has a philosophy that you like than you will
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.840]   if you're doing compliance for a firm that practices modern portfolio theory and mainstream
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   advice that you don't believe in.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.960]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:37.920]   I've actually passed the first level of the CFA accreditation or credential.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.800]   So I've kind of got one foot in that realm, but there's not many of those jobs in Tampa,
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.880]   whereas if I wanted to sell financial services, you can do that anywhere.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   Of course.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   There's people really.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   Of course.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:59.640]   So one last question there, what advice do you have on figuring out a firm's philosophy
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.800]   or whether it's a small or a big one?
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.200]   I think start by reading their, what's it called?
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.000]   I'm blanking on the disclosure form.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   ADV.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   ADV, yeah.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.400]   Start by reading their ADV.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   That's always my first goal is pull a firm's ADV and read it and a well-written ADV will
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.300]   tell you what you need to know.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.040]   You can read about their investment philosophy, etc.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.760]   So that'd be thing number one.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.120]   Thing number two would just be do interviews.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.040]   If I were in your situation, I would be doing at least a weekly lunch interview with somebody
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.360]   in the investment management business.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.480]   You know as well as I do that it's very easy to get those people to lunch because everybody's
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.600]   recruiting.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.240]   And so you can start building the connections and the contacts.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.760]   And what I would do is I would start with whatever your current network is and I would
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.560]   start by trying to figure out how to get referred to the firms in town who already have the
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.800]   philosophy.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.320]   So if you explain, I'm trying to figure out if there are any firms who are practicing
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.160]   this style of investing.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.680]   Have you ever heard anybody doing that around?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.320]   And in time you probably will be able to find the firms that are in your area that are doing
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   that.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.800]   And then what I would do is as you get closer to that, then go to those firms and ask them
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.600]   for their advice of how to get into the business.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   What can you do?
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.400]   What I would point out to you if you're already studying for the CFA, I think that what you
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.960]   should be doing is probably publishing.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.760]   Because if you want to build even your own firm, one of the first things that you should
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:33.640]   probably do is practice your own skills and with your own portfolio, prove your concepts,
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:42.000]   research the academics of it, and then publish your way to a firm.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.960]   I've long admired Joshua Kennan who is a very skilled investor and a very skilled writer.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.040]   And Joshua Kennan for years wrote on his personal blog.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.160]   And then recently he started an investment management firm.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   Well his investment management firm was basically fully subscribed from the beginning because
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.360]   of his, I don't know, 10 years, 15 years of publishing.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.400]   So he wrote for about.com for many years.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   Years ago he wrote the Complete Idiot's Guide to Investing.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.160]   He's written just various investment articles on his own page.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.080]   But that allowed many hundreds of thousands of people around the world to connect with
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   him.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.120]   And the minute he was establishing a firm, then immediately anybody who had long come
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.000]   to be confident in his analytical skills, in his abilities, etc., immediately said,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.880]   "I want him managing my money."
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.120]   And he's had a very successful launch of his firm.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.520]   And so I think that even in today's world that kind of path is very doable.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.240]   It's not fast, but it is very doable.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   And if you're really into the investment side, that's what I would do is possibly try to
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.240]   just write your way into your own firm.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.440]   But you've got to have a platform already set up.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.120]   Good enough?
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.080]   I appreciate that.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   Thanks.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   All right.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   My pleasure.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   We move on.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   Stay in Florida.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   We go to Ryan in Jacksonville.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   Ryan, welcome to the show.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   How can I serve you today?
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   Ryan in Jacksonville.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   Can you hear me?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   Sounds good.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   Go ahead.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   Go ahead.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   Okay.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.360]   So I wasn't sure if this was going to the prepping group or the finance group.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.760]   I actually have a question for both.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   So which one would you rather field?
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   We've done a lot of finance.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   Let's start with prepping and then we'll go to finance.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   Okay.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.360]   So I've listened to probably half of both your food and your water course.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.880]   They've both been very thorough and interesting.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   So thank you for that.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:51.240]   One of the things that a few people in the community have recommended is backing off
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   on drugs like heroin, cocaine, marijuana, coffee.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   For barters, right?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.640]   No, but like penicillin and antibiotics and whatnot.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:17.160]   Those people have pointed to the animal versions of it as just like an emergency store of antibiotics
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.600]   like fish mox or whatever.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.560]   And I just wanted to get your opinion on that, especially given that a lot of that stuff's
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.240]   manufactured on prices of the moment, of course, in China.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.960]   But I mean, overall, and I don't think that you touched on that in the course yet.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.640]   And if you have, I apologize.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   I haven't gotten there.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.080]   Yeah, I did not want to get your thoughts on that.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.320]   So first I have to give a disclaimer.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.240]   I'm not a medical expert, not a doctor.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.720]   I'm untrained in how to use or administer antibiotics to actually give antibiotics or
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.880]   prescribe them to myself or a family member would be incredibly difficult for me to do
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.240]   because I'm acutely aware of my lack of knowledge.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.520]   And so you're getting advice from somebody who has no medical qualifications whatsoever.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:09.600]   Having been a researcher, I have found plenty of corroborating voices that say that things
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.000]   like fish antibiotics are the exact same antibiotics that are prescribed to humans.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.640]   They're just simply relabeled.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:22.560]   And I have found many doctors who have confirmed, who have at least been their opinion and their
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.120]   educated opinion, who have said that, yes, this is a worthwhile and a good way to get
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.200]   amounts of these antibiotics.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.400]   And so in the United States where antibiotics are very hidden behind prescriptions, it's
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.040]   one of the very few ways to get amounts of those antibiotics.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.480]   And I would have no, I think it's a good idea to have a stockpile of those antibiotics.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.040]   The fish antibiotics are usually the proper thing, or sorry, the first thing that people
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   go to.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.760]   And so I would see it as definitely a good thing to have a stockpile of those antibiotics,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.360]   but more importantly, to have some literature written as to what to look for if you're going
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.000]   to prescribe antibiotics.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.900]   Some of the books, the medical prepping books and things like that have some of that.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.940]   Some articles on how to figure out dosages, et cetera, would be important.
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.440]   Because if you're a layman who doesn't have the medical background to just off the top
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.880]   of your head make a proper prescription, I think you should be very, very careful with
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   that.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.140]   But at the end of the day, if I had the choice, you know, my child, you know, was chopping
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.320]   wood and cut their leg and all of a sudden they've got a vicious infection, and my choice
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.400]   is between watching their leg get worse and worse versus giving them fish antibiotics,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.680]   I would much rather have the fish antibiotics ready to go.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.040]   And then hopefully have somebody who would be an expert.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.520]   You know, the best thing would be to have somebody who I know, a friend or someone who
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   would have the medical qualifications to do a better job of supervising them and prescribing
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.520]   them.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.820]   And if you can possibly have the chance of saving somebody's life by having access to
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.380]   a supply of antibiotics inexpensively, I think it's a good move.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.660]   It is funny though, because in the United States is one of the few areas, few countries
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.420]   where this is as difficult.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.220]   Certainly there are prescriptions around the world that are difficult, but there are many
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.460]   cultures in which you can just simply go and buy antibiotics over the counter.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.420]   And so the other source, if you want to get more generic antibiotics, is often if you'll
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.820]   go to an ethnic store, sometimes if you'll go to an ethnic food store where you have
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.940]   a culture where they're more accustomed to being able to buy antibiotics, it's not technically
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.700]   legal, but you can often get your hands on just generic antibiotics at the, you know,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.340]   the Mexican food store, the Vietnamese, something like that.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.380]   I've not personally done that, but I've heard enough people who've done it that I would
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.740]   investigate that if for some reason you don't think that fish antibiotics are your first
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.820]   starting place.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.740]   But in addition to the antibiotics, make sure that you also have some of the supporting
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.500]   literature printed out and stored with them so that you can potentially have the ability
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.380]   to, because it's not just having the drug, having the drug is good.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.620]   And then if you have somebody who would have an idea of how to administer the drug or in
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.980]   the right circumstances, who would be able to screen the patient and do a better job
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.340]   than you would, that's also good.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.220]   But at the end of the day, if you're going to do it by yourself, and this is the worst
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.740]   case scenario you're thinking of, make sure you have the supporting literature that you
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.220]   need in the reference manuals.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.860]   Got it.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   Okay.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.860]   Thank you.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.620]   Go with your finance question.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.340]   Oh, sure.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:24.020]   So the finance question is, I currently invest fully in a 401k plan.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:28.220]   I think the max is like, I don't know, 19,000 for this year or something like that.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.420]   Either way it's the max.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:41.380]   And I've been seriously considering discontinuing the funding that and taking only up to what
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:49.220]   my company will match, because I'm starting to look down the road and look at where our
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:54.500]   politicians are taking us in terms of overspending and future taxation and whatnot.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.020]   And I'm starting to think that maybe my tax bracket in retirement will not in fact be
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   lower than it is today.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.700]   And so maybe it would be more beneficial to just take the tax hit now and keep all of
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.340]   my money in a savings account or a brokerage account or some other combination of that
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:17.380]   rather than crossing the fingers and hope that in 30 years tax rates are lower.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.460]   Based on the commitments that we have, the liabilities we have outstanding that we've
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:29.220]   promised to future generations, I just don't see how we can possibly afford to fund them
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.660]   unless we massively increase taxation.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.340]   So just wondered your thoughts on taking the tax hit now versus later.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.100]   How much is your annual income?
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.820]   Mine personally is around $100.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.820]   And your household?
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:50.940]   Probably $250, $250.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:57.300]   And is your wife additionally investing into her 401k?
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.540]   She was last year, she did not this year.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:05.140]   But our plan would be that she would.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:13.500]   So at $38,000 per year on a $250,000 income, that's about 15% of your income that would
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.260]   be going into 401k accounts.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:21.340]   Now depending on your expenses, if your expenses are lower, I'd like to have you with a higher
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.460]   savings rate than 15%.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.020]   And so let's say that your savings rate is something like 30% which is a more meaningful
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.580]   savings rate than just the basic 15%.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.260]   If in that situation, I don't see why you have to choose between one or the other.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:39.460]   I think you would have enough money if you're saving something like 30% of your income,
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.240]   you would have enough money to live a perfectly fine lifestyle while still taking advantage
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.940]   of the benefits of the 401k while also having some diversification, not having all of your
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.100]   money in 401ks.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:58.020]   So practically speaking, that's probably in my opinion the best idea and the best plan.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.100]   The second thing you have to think about is what do you want to invest the money in.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.900]   If you're just going to invest the money into taxable brokerage accounts, it's really hard
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:11.060]   to say that you shouldn't start with the 401k because it's just really hard.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.220]   Now I understand the concern that you have.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.980]   I share your concern and your guess is as good as mine.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.900]   We have the same concern and we're basically just guessing.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:29.460]   But when I look forward decades into the future, my crystal ball doesn't work that far and
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.660]   I can't predict reliably exactly where things are going to be.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:41.740]   I do think that the American population is less likely to be willing to have those major
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:46.540]   tax increases on something like a 401k plan than many others.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.360]   I think that Americans like their 401ks and I think that the people who are loudest in
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.820]   politics are those who are wealthy and who are 401ks.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:02.820]   And so if you believe that wealthy people exert an undue influence on government, which
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:08.360]   I personally do believe that, then I think it's less likely that 401k legislation and
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.260]   such would pass that would start imposing that taxation on 401ks.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.720]   But I don't know.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.860]   Maybe there's some kind of populist uprising and all of a sudden now the wealthy people
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.020]   can't exert influence on government and on tax policy, etc.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.020]   Maybe not.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.500]   I do just think that as an employee, it's hard for me to see the circumstance that you're
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.020]   going to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.620]   It's hard to see.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:40.820]   And I think that if we look at the past, it's much more likely that Americans are going
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:48.700]   to try to borrow, keep borrowing, borrowing, borrowing, and then try to default through
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.300]   something like mass inflation, then that they would change, make significant changes to
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.440]   tax policy.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.740]   No matter who's been president, no matter what tax proposal has been enforced over the
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:06.140]   last 75, 80 years, taxation has basically been limited to about 20 to 25% of GDP.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.040]   And that seems to be a pretty hard ceiling.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.660]   And so it's my guess that it's more likely that politicians would move in the direction
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.340]   of mass inflation rather than trying to all of a sudden tax 401ks.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   Now I don't know.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.340]   It could be wrong.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.340]   It's always a possibility.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:28.140]   And so if you're really worried about it, I would respect you for not...
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.140]   I would respect that.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.860]   I wouldn't say that you're wrong.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.620]   I would just say that I don't see it quite the same way as you do at the moment.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.620]   Based upon the information that we have, that kind of move to me seems pretty far away.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:46.240]   And although I get it, it just doesn't seem quite the best path.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.860]   And so I think you could probably hedge your bets and use your 401k accounts while still
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.380]   saving into other investments that would hedge your bets in some way.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.080]   That'd probably be what I would do.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:07.380]   If you were that serious about the future of US problems, I think you should start by
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.540]   making a plan to be free of the United States.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.540]   That's what I've done.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:18.900]   Now, this may be difficult for you based upon where you are in terms of your jobs, etc.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:23.020]   But what I have done when analyzing the problem is I've looked at it and said, "I think that
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.420]   there is a very severe future for the United States."
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:32.820]   And so what I need in order to be able to fully escape is I need to have a plan that
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.700]   allows me to move to another region of the world.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.420]   I need to have multiple citizenships so that I can renounce my US citizenship and so I
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.340]   could cut myself free from a sinking ship.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.060]   Now I don't think the ship is sinking right now.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.900]   I don't think the ship is going to sink in the next decade.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:56.740]   But I figure if I can arrive at the year 2030 and have multiple other ships that I can just
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:02.120]   simply step onto, then I can cut myself free from the sinking ship or cut my children free
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.180]   from the sinking ship and then have other options.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:11.460]   And so what I'm trying to do is to establish what I would need to fully extricate myself
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:23.700]   from the USS USA in case the ship goes down and then simultaneously financially to have
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:29.940]   investments that are not only in retirement accounts to hedge my bets.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.020]   Now I do still participate in retirement accounts.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.340]   To me it just seems it doesn't seem the evidence doesn't seem strong enough to convince me
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.940]   that I should not participate in retirement accounts right now.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.420]   But I'm hedging my bets.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   So that's my answer.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.020]   Does that help at all or just muddy the waters?
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.780]   Yeah, it helps.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:58.140]   So one of the things I've also been thinking of is taking some of that money and buying
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.460]   investment real estate in my region of the country.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.380]   Real estate is way overpriced right now.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.980]   So I'm really I don't see that happening unless we have some type of recession or something
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.220]   where I can buy it on the cheap.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:17.020]   So it's just kind of what do I do right now that I'm trying to work through.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.700]   Well, so that would be notice that would be a good move.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   Okay.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.740]   And the reason notice what I said, I said, if you're just going to invest in stocks,
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.940]   then I think that you should prioritize your 401k.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.820]   But if you say, I think I'd like to move in the direction of being a real estate investor.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:37.000]   Now everything changes, where you're no longer just trying to make an unknowable prediction
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.860]   of what's going to happen with tax policy 30 years in the future.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.900]   I cannot, I don't believe that's knowable.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.340]   I don't see how anybody, we can make arguments with one another.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.260]   I've made some arguments here.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.840]   But that's too far to be able to predict accurately.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:46:00.500]   But if you can solve your concerns while simultaneously getting a result that is better in the short
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.700]   term where you can prove it, then I think you've got a really good solution.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:09.580]   So if you say, I'm going to minimize the amount of money that I put in my 401k, and I'm going
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:15.100]   to become a real estate investor, and I'm doing that so that I can develop this other
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.100]   plan, potentially get a higher return based on leveraged investment real estate, diversify
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:25.540]   my investments out of stocks, and a side benefit is I'm no longer fully committed to the taxation
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:29.780]   scheme of 401k accounts, now I think you've got a much stronger argument.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.020]   And so I can easily listen to that argument and say, yeah, go for it.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.940]   And that's been an argument that I have, that's also been something that's been influential
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.940]   on me.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.640]   I do still participate in some 401k accounts.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.180]   But at the moment, it's, at the moment, all my funds are sitting in cash.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.340]   And that's due to some of my frustrations with general stock market investing.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.940]   Now in the future, I'll do more self-directed investing, but I've been waiting on a recession.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.620]   Now it's been a tough week.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.860]   As I record the show, the market is down again, another 2%, over 10% for the week.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.820]   There's a very good reasons to believe that these kinds of events that are happening right
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.380]   now could be catalysts of ushering in a recession.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.220]   And I've been waiting on a recession for years so that property prices come down so that
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.780]   I can start to make some significant investments.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.060]   And so your recession might be coming sooner than you think.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.380]   My only point is I want to make predictions and decisions that are going to benefit me
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:32.620]   on multiple levels and only having the level of possibly avoiding this future higher tax
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:38.160]   by guaranteeing that I've got to pay tax every single year, to me that doesn't seem compelling.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.860]   So if you can add some benefits, then you can persuade me.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.860]   Okay.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:48.580]   Can I just really quickly pull on a string that you left out there?
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:54.660]   You've mentioned it twice in this episode and that is buying rental property with leverage.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.420]   Is that something that you always recommend or is it situation specific?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.260]   I mean, if you have the cash, should you buy it outright or do you always recommend that
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.100]   someone have a mortgage on a rental property?
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.500]   I think it depends on the phase that someone is at in terms of their real estate investment.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:18.980]   If somebody has a lot of cash, I talk to my wife about this and I say, we talk about it,
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.180]   I say, okay, listen, if I die, here's what I would recommend that you do.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.460]   I give her the list of people, you call these people and you get advice from them and I
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:30.860]   say, you have this amount of money and here are the things that I think you should do
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   with it.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.860]   Right?
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.420]   So when I give her advice on that and I say, here's how much money you would have if I'm
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.020]   dead and here's what I think you should do with it.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.980]   One of the things that I recommend to her is that she just simply pay cash for some
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.460]   rental houses and that she do that in the town where she is and she just pay cash for
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.460]   it.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.060]   But that's because if I die, she's going to have a lot of money.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.380]   I have a lot of life insurance in addition to our other assets and so she would have
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:59.820]   a lot of money and there's no reason to take on the risk of leverage for her in that situation.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.920]   She doesn't need the money.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.940]   She wouldn't spend it if she had extra money because she could just optimize it.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:10.980]   But what she will really value is the simplicity and the safety of having a debt free portfolio.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.100]   That fits with her personality and it would work really well.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.660]   Now that's different if I come to you and let's say that you say, Joshua, I've saved
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:23.660]   $50,000 and I really want to be financially independent quickly and I want to do it with
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.660]   real estate.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.580]   Well, you can't get there with real estate if you're paying cash for it unless you're
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   unique.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.860]   I know I have one friend who's done it.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.820]   He became financially independent in about seven years paying cash for real estate.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.740]   But he's also very handy and he didn't make a lot of money but he's very handle, extremely
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.660]   frugal, and he built his portfolio debt free and he became financially independent in about
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.580]   seven years on real estate.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.660]   But that's not the skills that are different than most people.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.820]   So in that situation, in the United States where you have very easy access to money at
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:00.540]   very low rates, artificially propped up by the Federal Reserve, keeping interest rates
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:06.940]   low, etc., it's hard to argue against the benefits of leverage in the United States.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.940]   Notice I led with an example where I said with someone who has a lot of money, they
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.700]   don't need the risk, they don't have any benefit of having the more money, then there's no
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.240]   reason to take the risk.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.920]   But for the guy with $50,000, it's hard to argue against leverage.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.140]   The other thing that I've thought of is it's hard for me to see because the US market is
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:31.060]   so heavily dependent on leverage, it has dramatically suppressed many returns.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:37.820]   And so basically the conclusion that I've come to is that it doesn't make sense really,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.880]   with the exception of what I said, somebody has lots of money that is looking for a stable
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.900]   income portfolio to diversify their other investments, fine.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.100]   But it doesn't really make sense to invest in the United States without leverage.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.260]   And if you're going to invest without leverage, I'm increasingly convinced that it just makes
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.420]   sense to go to another place.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:56.420]   You can take the same amount of money in the United States that you're going to invest
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   in real estate.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.220]   And if you go to a market where credit is not nearly so available, go to Central America,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:08.460]   South America, go to Asia, go to Eastern Europe, now you can move into a market where the credit
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.900]   is just simply not as available, the money doesn't flow as freely in the United States,
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:18.660]   and you can really use your cash more effectively, where you can control more property because
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:24.660]   of lower prices, you can get higher yields, and potentially make a lot more money, because
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:29.140]   you're going where your investment strategy is going to be more effective.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.780]   Now I understand that most people don't want to leave their home market, but I'm increasingly
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.640]   convinced that that's the solution.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:42.260]   So if I have $50,000 saved, and if I want to invest that money without leverage, it's
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.860]   very hard to see how to do that effectively in the United States and get any meaningful
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.060]   return on the money.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.340]   But it's a lot easier for me to see how to do that in other markets, where I can buy
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.940]   in at lower dollars, I can get higher yields, and that money goes a lot farther because
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.220]   those markets are simply not awash in mortgage money like the United States is.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:05.220]   Okay, thanks for taking the time.
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:10.180]   Good questions, Ryan, I appreciate the call.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.820]   We move on now to New Jersey.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.060]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, how can I serve you today?
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:21.340]   New Jersey, I hear you're on the road, go ahead, yes, there you are.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.060]   Sorry about that, how are you doing, Josh?
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.060]   Very well, sir, how are you?
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   I'm good, I'm good.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:36.300]   I just heard your podcast yesterday on donating for Venezuela, and I would like to know what
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.980]   do I have to do for that?
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.720]   Send me an email to joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, and I'll share those details with you privately.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:50.600]   Because of the sensitivity of the work that we're doing, I'm not interested in publicizing
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:55.680]   that kind of information publicly, and so email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.480]   and I will give you those details privately.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.400]   All right, thank you very much.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   My pleasure.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.120]   All right, we move on to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.600]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   Hi, Joshua, can you hear me?
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.160]   Yes, sounds good, go ahead.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.840]   Hi, this is John.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:24.160]   I had a question about mindset between two pretty good options of how I should handle
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.160]   the next few years.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:31.600]   Just as a little bit of background, the last, I guess, about two years ago and the four
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:38.000]   years before that, I was very focused on saving up some money and quitting, and just had a
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.920]   high-stress job that I didn't really like very much.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.240]   The things were good enough, and I didn't quit.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:52.640]   What I ended up doing instead was really knuckling down and focusing on a dream job that I wanted.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.720]   It wasn't easy, but I did actually go through the right moves and got that dream job.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.320]   It's tough when you get your dreams, because sometimes they don't work out to be the way
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.400]   you thought they would be.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.000]   It's a very good job.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.120]   I enjoyed it immensely.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:15.600]   Once the shine wore off after six months or so, I felt some of those old feelings coming
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   back in.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:24.200]   I struggle whether or not it's just me and the corporate world not aligning, different
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.520]   things, values, and just how it works gets done.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.360]   But then again, I don't feel super confident jumping to entrepreneurship.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:39.400]   I've had dabbles in it, or mildly, not unsuccessful, but by no means self-sustaining.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:46.480]   My question is, I'm back to this point of deciding whether I should stay or leave.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.640]   The very good thing that I have going on here is that I do get paid a good salary.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.480]   There's a lot of stress and a lot of things that were wrong with the old job, but I do
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.880]   get compensated very well, and I work very hard for that.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:09.760]   But the kicker is that for the next two and a half years, part of my compensation, it
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.800]   is variable, not a sure thing, but there's a very good chance that this extra compensation
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.640]   I get for the next two and a half years will not quite double my salary, but it's a significant
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.560]   amount more, let's say one and a half to 1.75 times my salary for the next two and a half
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.560]   years.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:31.000]   So that's nothing to sneeze at, to just dismiss right away.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.680]   It seems like a prudent thing to stick around for those next two and a half years, but I
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:39.800]   balance that with having a four and a six-year-old, which I'd like to obviously be at home with
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   more.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.640]   My wife's already at home.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.480]   So I consider having a four and six-year-old at home, but obviously they want me home.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:52.520]   It feels like it would be the right thing to do to do that.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.000]   But then again, six and a half and an eight and a half-year-old in two and a half years,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.080]   they probably will still also be very excited to have me home.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.440]   It feels like it's definitely a question of selling out for the time of my kids for this
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.800]   very...
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:15.720]   Not everybody gets a chance to earn four years worth of salary in two and a half years.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.720]   So there's a balance.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   I'm trying to figure out how to sort that out.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:27.240]   Not that we're so necessary to have that extra money, but it does feel prudent to not let
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240]   that go.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.440]   I did work very hard to try to land this position.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.680]   How close are you to financial independence on your current rate of savings, investments,
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.680]   et cetera?
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.600]   How far away is your financial independence date?
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:45.240]   Well, this week notwithstanding.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:50.120]   It's been one of those things for the last two to three years.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.920]   I've probably been right at the edge of it anyways with some conservative thinking, but
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.080]   not to the point where I would quit and then never pursue work again.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.520]   I feel like it is good and there's always things I'm interested in.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:09.160]   I just never feel confident in my ability to provide with just that.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:14.960]   But certainly a little bit of extra income that we would need would be something I could
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   scrub up.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.440]   It's just maybe I wouldn't be doing the things on the side that I would love to do, but I
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.200]   would definitely go to try out new things.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.680]   And then there's lots of good things I get from this job.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.560]   It's just the stresses and stuff have all come back, but I definitely like a lot of
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.360]   parts of it.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:39.080]   If we move forward for two years and you were able to generate that extra income and maintain
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:43.560]   your current lifestyle, your current plan, are you confident that two years from now
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.800]   you'd be financially independent?
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   I mean, we do have high exposure to the markets, which I could adjust.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.960]   But I can also just adjust that with making supplemental income that's not in a very stressful
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   career.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:07.160]   But yeah, I think it would put me in a more comfortable position where I wouldn't feel
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:13.120]   like I really needed to make something work like a side hustle or it wouldn't be a side
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.200]   hustle, it would be a new venture.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:22.320]   I would feel less pressure on that and maybe that would give me some relief.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.880]   Do you and your wife have any ideas?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.960]   Because I'm kind of jumping right into it because we've got a long history of your calling
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   in Q&A shows.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.800]   Listeners will know John in Pittsburgh, he does a good job of calling in.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:39.760]   John, you're a hero.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:45.520]   Do you and your wife have any kind of proposed lifestyles that are unusual, that are outside
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.320]   of just living in your current house, I don't know, traveling around Southeast Asia or buying
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.520]   an RV and taking your children across the United States?
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.080]   Do you have any of those things that have ever been attractive to you?
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:02.000]   You know, all of those things at different stages have been things I've thought a lot
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.840]   about and probably my wife has had different aspects of.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:11.360]   But I wouldn't say any of them have been something she's been voicing.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:18.240]   All in all, we've made so many adjustments, mostly from listening to you and making these
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:22.880]   micro adjustments and changes and being confident in this or that, that we're very happy where
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   we are.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:30.040]   A lot of it comes down to the fact that we aren't in a big need of any drastic lifestyle
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   changes.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.120]   We have a very modest house in a nice area.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.800]   It's the smallest house in the block, but it gets by.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.440]   I mean, other than making little things in our house, creature comfort a little bit better
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:47.200]   and upgrading things and adjusting my frugality, and I'm doing a good job of that, is spending
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:54.040]   on things that make value for us, whether it's exercise classes or something for my
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.880]   wife and trying to build more time for myself to exercise rather than be stressed all the
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   time.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.040]   We don't have a lot of big dreams like that.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:07.360]   Yeah, of course, it'd be nice to take more vacations and think less of the money, but
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.400]   everything's, again, everything's so just good enough that...
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:21.040]   Again, the kids also make our lives happier at home, and just being fulfilled with that,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.360]   at least at this phase of life, is very fulfilling.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.840]   I do get fulfilled from my work as stressful as it is also, so it's something I don't want
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.240]   to quit and then regret quitting to be with them.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.040]   Maybe I enjoy being with them so much on the weekends now because it's a treat for me.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.080]   I've made a lot of other lifestyle improvements where I never really go out, I don't drink.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   There's so many things I've changed in the last five to six years that just makes home
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   life so fulfilling.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:59.400]   But yeah, everything's just so good enough, but it's hard to decide what to trade off.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.800]   Here's my instinct.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:08.200]   I think my instinct is I think you should stay at this job for another two years.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.680]   That should be your plan.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.640]   And I could see a few things happening.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:19.280]   So first, this job is something that you thought a couple years ago was going to be your dream
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   job.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.160]   Now, everything that glitters is not always gold.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.960]   Sometimes you move in and you try something and you realize, you know, this comes with
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.320]   its downsides.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.160]   I don't believe there's a job in the world or a business in the world that doesn't come
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.720]   with downsides.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.300]   Radical personal finance is my dream job.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.360]   There are things that I just flat out don't like doing.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.720]   And that's one of the reasons why I continue to pursue financial independence because I
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.880]   often wonder, well, if I were really financially independent, am I sure?
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.200]   I say I would still do it.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.940]   I really think I would still do it, but would I really?
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.940]   Maybe I wouldn't.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.080]   Maybe I just don't know myself.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.520]   Maybe I would sit around and hang out on the beach 168 hours a week.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   I don't know.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.600]   Like, I don't think I would.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.240]   I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.880]   Every bit of it, self-analysis and introspection, every bit of logical thinking has convinced
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.360]   me that I would keep on working, that I would keep on doing this or variations of this.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.760]   But maybe I'm wrong.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.960]   Maybe I don't actually know it.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.600]   And so the point is that even the – and I feel like what I do is a better fit for
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.160]   me than anybody I've ever met in my life and there are jobs for them.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160]   But it still has its downsides.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:30.680]   And so I think that you should focus on the fact that you thought this was a dream job
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.320]   and you do find it very fulfilling and meaningful and recognize that everything in life is going
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   to have some things that are frustrating.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.840]   Now when you get to things like stress, I would say that if your concern is stress,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:49.340]   you probably could gain by just simply identifying that and learning ways to eliminate the feelings
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:56.640]   of stress, learning ways to insulate yourself and using your strength as a person to minimize
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   that.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.640]   Now how do you do it?
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.640]   I don't know.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.840]   It could just be recognizing that the end doesn't really matter and I'm just going
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840]   to ignore the stress.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.480]   I've gotten better at minimizing some stress that I face just by recognizing this is all
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480]   a game.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   This is all in my head.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.600]   And this thing that I used to let stress me out, it doesn't actually matter.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.880]   I'm just going to let it go.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.520]   And I've gotten better at managing stress.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.480]   And I think that especially if you look at most people's career growth, if you're going
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   to grow in your career and move up in jobs, move up in responsibility, one of the key
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:33.680]   skills that you have to master is recognizing that this is simply stress and this is fake.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.320]   It's not that it doesn't matter, but it's that I can't let this affect me.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:43.520]   Think about how much stress on a daily basis the president of a country faces.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.480]   President Trump, just think about the stress that he's under every single day.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.560]   That would break me.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.820]   That would break any of us who hadn't proceeded through it.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.680]   Think about what the president of a company or the leader of an organization faces when
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.600]   all of a sudden your organization is going into bankruptcy.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:06.440]   One of the key skills to advance is to recognize that I have to learn how to deal with this
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.960]   stress and how to let it not affect me emotionally.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:16.400]   And so it could be that you could engage in learning, study, and personal growth in order
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.160]   to minimize some of the things that you don't like.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.580]   This could also be helped by your simply seeing yourself as stronger than you've previously
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.240]   thought yourself to be.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.320]   For example, if you have lots of money and you know that you're thinking about leaving
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.840]   this job, just stop doing some of the stuff that you don't like or go tell your boss and
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.160]   say, "Boss, I don't want to do these things anymore.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   They're not a good fit for me.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.520]   I want to do these other things," and figure out how to renegotiate it.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.960]   And if they tell you, "Well, you could do that, but you got to take a $20,000 cut in
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   salary."
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960]   Okay, fine.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.120]   I've got my salary, $20,000.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   I don't want to do those things.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   I want to do these things.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.040]   Now, I'm clearly being flippant in that tone, but something like that might be able to be
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040]   possible.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.160]   You can renegotiate almost anything in life.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.000]   And if you've got the comfort of knowing that you're wealthy, that you are practically financially
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.800]   independent, knowing that you have other options if you lost this job, it should give you the
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.000]   strength to be able to renegotiate the constraints of your job in some way.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.080]   You might also just simply do something like use your money to hire more help, whether
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.480]   you do that informally or formally, outsourcing some of the things of your job you don't like,
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   hire your own personal assistant out of your own salary, and split your job with somebody.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.760]   Renegotiate the constraints of your job would be one thing.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:34.440]   Now, when you're this close to financial independence and this close to being comfortably financially
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:40.240]   independent, and given the fact that you've never really wanted to pursue entrepreneurship,
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.160]   it's more like, "I could see how I would do it," but it's not been something that's been
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.440]   burning for you.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.840]   I think you stick it out for two years.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.840]   I really do.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.880]   And here are some other things that I think would be meaningful.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.600]   So with a four-year-old and a six-year-old, you are definitely on the cusp of where your
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.320]   presence as a father will be increasingly valued.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.000]   But you already have your wife there with your children all the time, and so they're
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.640]   already being well cared for.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.520]   Now, if your wife were working a job and they were being raised by other people, then that
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.920]   would be more pressing.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.080]   But they're already getting substantial attention from mom.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:18.320]   And your presence two years from now is going to be more important than it is today.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320]   Should you be there today?
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.320]   Sure, of course.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.600]   But it's going to be different working with an eight-year-old and a six-year-old in terms
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.160]   of the types of things that you can be involved in and the type of help that they need.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.640]   Children need their mother much more in the early years, and they need their father much
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.040]   more in the transition years to adulthood.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.640]   And so if you are financially independent two years from now and you're with them 24
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:48.240]   hours a day two years from now, it's going to be more important then than it is now.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.320]   And if you're this close to being fully financially independent and you have an opportunity to
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.400]   make quite a bit of money, to me it makes sense to just see it through.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:02.440]   Now the other flip side that I would say is look at where we are economically.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.840]   Now especially this week has been an interesting week, and obviously that's affected your investments,
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.280]   which affects your confidence in your financial independence numbers.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.080]   Well, time will take care of that.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.280]   But I think there's a very decent chance that we're heading into a significant recession.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   I don't prove that.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.720]   I don't have any numerical scenario, but we're overdue for a recession.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:29.160]   And when I think about the potential economic effects of the coronavirus, et cetera, I think
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.480]   there's a very decent chance that this could go ahead and be a triggering event for a serious
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.600]   recession.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.480]   Now maybe it's not.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.120]   Maybe next week a vaccine is perfected, coronavirus is cured, and everything changes.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.600]   Even so, still, the last three months have been so disruptive to the Chinese economy
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.780]   and to many other, and are currently so disruptive to many economies, I still think it would
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:52.080]   be a significant recession.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.080]   But maybe it all goes over, in which case things are different.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.920]   But if we're going into a period of recession, this is a time where you want to try to keep
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.960]   the job that you have.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.980]   It's a time where if you can keep your earning ability, you should have more opportunities
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.300]   to invest at good deals.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.260]   So whether that's to buy more stocks at depressed prices, or whether to buy some real estate
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:17.580]   or other investments at depressed prices, if you can keep your high income and you can
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:23.540]   stay on track for that extra 1.5 to 1.7x of compensation, then you have opportunities
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.080]   to buy investments.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.480]   On the flip side, let's say that your company starts to face problems and the recession
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.780]   starts to affect you personally, you may be able to get yourself laid off.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.180]   If you get laid off, maybe you get a nice layoff package, a nice severance package.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:44.340]   Maybe you can use that as an excuse to do something different than you would have otherwise
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   done.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.940]   Maybe you go ahead and say, "Well, I got laid off, and I was thinking about leaving anyway,
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:52.300]   but I got laid off in a time where just about everybody else got laid off, and what we've
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.540]   long wanted to do is we've wanted to go and spend some time in Mexico and study Spanish.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.820]   So let's take our children to Mexico, and we'll go and hide out there for six months,
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.980]   wait for the recession to pass, and lower our expenses so that we can really enjoy something
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.340]   like this, rent our house out, something like that."
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:13.420]   And so I think given the uncertainty of the moment and how close you are to being really
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.860]   comfortably financially independent, so that even if you did start a business, you knew
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:21.100]   you didn't have to run that business, I would stick it out.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.860]   I would focus on the good, try to renegotiate what I don't like about the job.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.220]   I would stick it out and wait to see, because I think this next couple of years is going
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.860]   to be a very interesting time.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.700]   If you get laid off, you know, let's sit down, do some financial planning, take a look at
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.020]   everything, decide what do you want to do.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020]   Do you want to try to get another job?
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.980]   Do you just want to stay home with the children?
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.420]   Do you want to – what do you want to do?
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:47.340]   If you can keep your high earnings right now, and you can buy some investments at discounted
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.460]   prices, I think that'll help you.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.100]   And so I don't see any reason why I think you should quit today.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.940]   I would stick it out for another year and assess, and then stick it out for another
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.620]   year and assess, and then around that time, depending on what happens over the next year
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.740]   or two, go ahead and make those longer term decisions.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.140]   Thank you very much.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.780]   I really appreciate that.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:09.340]   That gives me confidence in the things I was unsure of and doubles down on the things,
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.660]   a lot of what you said I was already thinking, so that gives me a lot of encouragement there.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:26.140]   And on the leveraging my ability to have confidence here in my job, I've already given the benefit
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:28.340]   of that to my manager.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:32.260]   The new one I have is a first-time manager, and I feel like I've been able to be a very
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:39.940]   easy employee to him because of my position, not being especially needy for career growth,
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:45.580]   et cetera, and all these other things that are demanded of managers to do for their employees.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.100]   And I haven't turned that lens on myself to say, "How can I make a little easier on myself
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:53.980]   and maybe just take things a little less stressfully?"
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.700]   So yeah, that's all great stuff.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.980]   I've really enjoyed your recent Seven Rings of Freedom series.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.260]   We've established a lot of those, and it's great to have a goal for something other than
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.260]   one, so I appreciate it.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.260]   And I've also been...
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:13.060]   In the ones that you've established, do you agree with my assessment of them increasing
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.620]   your freedom and the quality of your life?
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.380]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:26.140]   We never really had a lot of debt, but having cash positions and especially about two years
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:33.260]   ago, two or three years ago, my wife decided to take the leap, and we gave up a substantial
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.740]   salary for her to stay at home.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:41.100]   And it's not been all wonderful in every dimension.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:47.100]   She's struggled just like anybody that has to deal with small kids all the time.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:53.540]   We try to be very mindful of giving her her own time and space, but that's been a huge
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.460]   benefit to both of us, I think, and especially to the children.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:02.820]   So that one especially rang true with me, and I don't think we would have...
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:09.980]   We very much saw the value of each of us through our salaries before a couple years ago, and
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:13.660]   I think you're a big part of turning that around, so I appreciate that.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:17.060]   And by the way, if anybody's wondering the back catalog, if you've already listened to
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.420]   everyone, you should go back and listen to everyone again.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.660]   I've been through them about two and a half times, so you're a different person when you
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.660]   listen to them each time.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:24.660]   So we'll check it out.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.660]   I so appreciate that, John.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   Thank you.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:31.780]   And I'm so glad you've been here, a long-time listener, and it's such a blessing, and I'm
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.580]   glad that my work has been helpful to you.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.500]   So all right, we move on now to the Beehive State, Brigham City, Utah.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   Welcome to the show.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   Welcome to the show today.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.500]   Hello, Joshua.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.500]   Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.820]   Hi, my name's Kevin.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.140]   I'd like to thank you for your show.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.900]   I have purchased two of your courses, and I highly recommend them.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:13:02.420]   I'm calling today for your thoughts on citizenship for... and flag-planting theory for my children.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.740]   You prepared to answer that?
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:04.740]   I'm ready.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   I love the topic.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   Let's go.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   Okay.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:16.940]   So I'm looking to provide either second or third citizenships for my children, primarily
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:22.020]   for their career and job opportunities when they come of age.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:28.300]   I currently have two children aged two and three, or two and almost four.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:35.020]   We are big fans of self-education and homeschooling, which I believe would limit general work visa
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.660]   applications to other countries.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:43.220]   Birth tourism may also be an option here because we may be adding to our family, so that may
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.580]   provide a citizenship or an option for them.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:54.100]   And with our existing citizenships, I'm actually Canadian, and I'm in Costa Rica right now,
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.900]   but that's just a vacation.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:03.180]   My wife and I are our Canadian citizens, and her parents are Portuguese citizens, which
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:09.820]   through their family citizenship program, we are going to obtain.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:15.180]   We are frugally financially independent, which gives us time to fulfill residency requirements
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.700]   as another option if we don't pursue birth tourism.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.580]   I'm just looking for your thoughts here.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:27.980]   So to confirm, both you... so your entire family, all of you are Canadian citizens.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:33.260]   Your wife's parents are Portuguese, and you're in the process of establishing her Portuguese
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:39.660]   citizenship, and then by extension, possibly you and your children's Portuguese citizenship.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:43.820]   And so you're working through that process, but that's just simply a matter of time, and
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.340]   then you'll have Portuguese citizenship for the whole family.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.340]   Is that right?
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.700]   That's correct.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.700]   Okay.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:55.020]   In addition to Canadian and Portuguese citizenships, do you have any other options in your family
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.060]   tree for citizenship by descent?
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.900]   No.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.260]   Okay.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:06.740]   And you are financially independent, you're able to live on your investments, so you're
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:15.380]   willing and able to relocate to another country, live there, especially if it would lead to
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.940]   a citizenship, and you don't have to have a job in that country in order to support
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.940]   yourself.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.940]   Did I understand that correctly?
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.820]   Yes, that is correct.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.820]   Okay.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:32.060]   So the major idea, the major reason why you would like your children to have a citizenship
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:40.060]   option that is in addition to Canadian and Portuguese citizenship is for their economic
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.460]   opportunities, their ability to work in other regions of the world.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.420]   Is that right?
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.380]   I believe that, yes.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:52.900]   Yes, that and possibly asset protection, but would also be for their benefit.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.900]   Okay.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:16:02.940]   So is there a region of the world that you think has strong growth prospects in the future?
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:06.460]   That's where I'm looking for your thoughts.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:18.060]   From what I take, Asia and East seem to have a population that is quickly becoming a good
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.580]   opportunity for us in our position right now.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.180]   I have not been there.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:31.700]   I've been to Europe briefly, and I'm currently in Central America, and we're working on our
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:36.900]   Spanish, but it's kind of a blank slate at this point.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.380]   Got it.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.700]   So it's an interesting thing.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:47.020]   So first, with regard to flag theory and with regard to your position as it now stands,
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:54.340]   you already have an extremely strong foundation that many people would be envious of.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:17:00.980]   As a Canadian, you have the ability to access the country of Canada.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.220]   Canada has major benefits from the perspective of long-term security.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:12.560]   Canada has the benefit of tremendous supplies of water, massive natural resources, a fairly
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:20.060]   stable culture and economy, and so in many ways, Canada is an extremely safe place to
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.300]   be.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.940]   And so the ability to access the Canadian job market is great.
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.260]   There's a very strong economy.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:30.560]   It's obviously centered along the southern coast, but when you go through the cities
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:37.580]   in Canada, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, I mean, all across Canada, you have major
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.160]   opportunities.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.020]   So you're already in good shape with regard to being a Canadian citizen.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:47.780]   In addition, in many ways, you have a superior benefit that if you wanted to leave Canada
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:53.220]   fully and completely expatriate from Canada, the Canadian government will largely leave
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.220]   you alone.
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:58.620]   They'll largely allow you to just go and do something else.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:08.220]   And you can become a Canadian non-tax resident and move elsewhere and thus completely eliminate
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.260]   your obligations, financial obligations to the Canadian government if you go through
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.460]   the process of becoming a Canadian non-resident.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.660]   Then you could still visit Canada, visit family and friends.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.480]   All of that is possible.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.940]   So Canada has a lot of benefits.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:28.180]   In addition, the Portuguese citizenship is going to be extremely valuable.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:32.900]   The Portuguese citizenship gives you access to the European Union, which certainly is
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.300]   a vibrant economy and has a lot of growth going to it.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.700]   There's a lot of potential.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.660]   The ability for your children to be EU citizens, to study, to live, to work anywhere in the
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:47.340]   EU, in my opinion, is extremely valuable.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:52.140]   Now if you think about diversification there, you don't really need access to another modern
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.940]   Western economy.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:59.260]   Even if your children wanted to enter the United States in the future for job prospects,
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:04.180]   it's simpler for a Canadian to enter the United States than for many other people.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.260]   And because of the closer relationship between the United States and Canada, they would have
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.740]   the option to enter the United States probably fairly easily if they wanted to do that.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:16.580]   And of course the United States is an economic powerhouse.
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:21.820]   There are good options with the different tax treaties and alliances with Canadians
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.860]   for some of the other countries, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:29.260]   Basically throughout the Queen's realm there are really good options that you gain access
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.180]   to with a Canadian passport.
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:35.580]   And the Portuguese passport has some interesting connections.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:40.220]   I'm not fully up to date on all of them, but interesting connections to Brazil and
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.700]   some options there.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:47.140]   And so I think that if we consider your passport portfolio and your citizenship portfolio,
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.820]   your big good high quality travel documents, check, check.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.980]   Portuguese passport, very strong.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.140]   Canadian passport, very strong.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.300]   So you can travel fairly freely.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.700]   You have the ability to expatriate from both of those places.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.900]   So that's good.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:08.820]   So where the weakness is I think in your passport portfolio and your options is regional.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:13.980]   What region of the world would your children be able to access?
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:18.380]   And the second weakness would be that the countries that you're involved in are fairly
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.060]   large countries.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:24.660]   So if you're interested in freedom, as I understand that you at least have some interest given
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:30.260]   that you're even interested in flag theory, one of the disadvantages of large country
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.460]   passports is that large countries can pursue you around the world.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.420]   So is Canada better than the United States with regard to pursuing you around the world?
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.420]   Yes.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.420]   With regard to taxation?
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.420]   Yes.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   With regards to spying on you?
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.100]   It's a little bit better, but unfortunately Canada is part of the five eyes.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:48.420]   And so they're going to follow you around the world.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.460]   And so could there come a day in which Canada does what the United States does and they
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:55.780]   say we're going to impose citizenship based taxation or we're going to impose all of
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:59.380]   these onerous rules on you because you are a Canadian citizen?
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.940]   Yes, there is.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.700]   Canada and Portugal are participating in the CRS system and so they're going to track your
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.300]   tax residency all around the world.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.580]   They're going to want to investigate your bank accounts.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:14.120]   Where you start to get some diversification in your plan is if you can bring in some other
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.620]   smaller countries.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.660]   So you're in Costa Rica.
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:23.900]   Costa Rica may not have as strong of a travel document as a Canadian passport.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.180]   Costa Rican passport is less powerful.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.500]   But there is one thing that's for sure.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:31.700]   If you're a Costa Rican citizen, Costa Rica does not have the money or the resources to
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.020]   follow you all around the world like Canada does.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.900]   Now Portugal of course has less money than Canada, but they don't have the resources.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:44.740]   And so you could get some diversification there by bringing in a citizenship from a
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.500]   smaller country versus a larger country.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.620]   That would be one benefit.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:53.580]   The other thing to think about is if you're primarily thinking about economic opportunities
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:58.860]   for your children, I think that you want to think about regions of the world where there
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.620]   is likely to be growth.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:06.980]   I don't see a lot of long-term opportunities for growth in the United States and/or Canada
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.740]   or Europe.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:13.100]   Now I'm not saying they're not going to grow, but what I'm saying is I don't see how they're
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.900]   going to grow.
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:15.900]   When I look –
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:16.900]   I agree.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.340]   And I think there are two big things.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:22.060]   First, there's already a very high standard of living in these countries.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:25.260]   And so given – by the way, apologies for the sniffing.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:30.740]   The only thing I don't have in my recording set up is a mute button, and I would, but
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.020]   maybe I've got coronavirus already.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.020]   Who knows?
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.260]   I hope not.
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:40.500]   The only thing that – the only place – so I think that if you look at the difference
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:46.340]   between the standard of living in Canada or the United States or Portugal, and you compare
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:52.620]   that to the standard of living in – well, where do we go?
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:23:02.420]   I guess in Cambodia or in Costa Rica or in Brazil or in Argentina.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   Many of these places are very sophisticated, right?
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:08.860]   There's very sophisticated cultures, but there's a much higher room to grow in some of those
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:14.860]   countries, to come up to global standards, which means, I think, more economic opportunity.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:20.740]   The second big thing that I think is going to be an extremely compelling thing in the
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.180]   future is going to be where is population growth happening.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.860]   Population growth in the United States is below replacement.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:30.940]   I think it's – off the top of my head, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think current
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:36.780]   population figures are 1.74 children per woman, which is below replacement rates in the United
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.780]   States.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.020]   I don't know what it is in Canada, but I think it's probably below replacement rates
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.820]   as well all throughout Western Europe.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.340]   Go ahead if you know it.
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:47.980]   >> Steven: It's just over 2.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.580]   It's a very slowly growing population.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.940]   >> Adam: Interesting.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.580]   And that could be due to significant immigration into Canada.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.420]   Obviously there's been over the last decade or two just massive levels of immigration
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:06.060]   into Canada, and new immigrants are more likely to be fecund than native-born people, but
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.400]   that's changing as well.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.600]   So same thing in Western Europe.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.980]   Population growth rates are – they're not growing.
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:15.420]   They're in decline.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.180]   And globally there's a very good chance it will be in a significant population decline
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.780]   in the long-term future.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:26.020]   So I think the places where there is population growth are really interesting, and those areas
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:33.260]   are somewhat in South America, somewhat in Asia, Southeast Asia possibly, although I
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.180]   would even need to look at each country by country, and then different parts of Africa
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.600]   where there would be massive levels of increased population.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.360]   And so if we're thinking about long-term, I would think about some of those markets.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.160]   So now let's go back to analyzing kind of the problem.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.920]   So you've got Western Europe taken care of.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:56.540]   You've got Canada, and I'll just say North America, taken care of.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.720]   So you're trying to figure out where are opportunities.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.160]   Do you think culturally would you be – you haven't traveled in Asia.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.440]   You're traveling in the Americas right now.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.040]   Are you fairly culturally comfortable in the Americas right now?
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.520]   Yes, it's a slight culture change.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   Everyone's happy.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.920]   I mean, you can still get all the amenities.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.360]   They're nowhere near what we've experienced in Canada, and we've frequented the United
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.400]   States for long periods of time, and everything's just at your fingertips there.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.980]   So we're a little spoiled with that, but I understand – yeah, the culture seems fine,
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:39.600]   and I think we're looking to – anyway, where the next checkout is, where to see – I think
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:45.840]   we're – yeah, we're comfortable with the culture in Costa Rica right now.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.160]   Are you engaging in long-term perpetual travel, or do you live in Canada and you just travel
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   for short periods of time?
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.200]   I guess we're in Canada.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.920]   I'm trying to kind of maximize it.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.400]   We're in Canada for 183 days.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:07.560]   Whatever it is I need to maintain my Canadian citizenship.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.000]   We've been spending a lot of time in the United States, and we're looking at spending at least
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.600]   whatever the countries will let us into.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:19.680]   I think most of the countries will let us in for 90 days in a spot, sometimes as low
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.320]   as 60 or 30 days.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.800]   So we're not perpetually traveling, but we are slow traveling for extended periods.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.080]   Are you continuing to be a Canadian tax resident?
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.840]   Yes.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:39.240]   But you want to do that in the future, or do you want to become a Canadian non-tax resident?
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:46.160]   Because we're living off our investments, and we're quite frugal with our expenses,
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.080]   I'm kind of below the radar on any high taxation from Canada.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.080]   Understood.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.200]   That's what I thought as far as you're being financially independent.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.000]   Why do you feel like you need to be physically in Canada 183 days?
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.160]   There are benefits.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   So I've paid a lot of taxes in getting into financial independence, and Canada has some
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:16.440]   very good child benefit laws, child benefits.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.960]   I'm kind of taking advantage of those to kind of get some of my money back out.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.440]   And yeah, that's why.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.760]   Okay, that makes more sense.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.960]   It'd be interesting, maybe we should schedule a standalone episode and talk to you about
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.800]   how you've achieved financial independence in a Canadian context and how to maximize
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   the options there.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.360]   It'd be an interesting discussion.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:42.680]   But so back to kind of citizenship.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.920]   To me, I would spend this time traveling, and I would travel, do some traveling and
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.880]   try to think about where you thought there were more options in the world, where you
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.880]   think growth is going to be, where in your travels do you look and say, "You know what?
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.800]   There's a lot here."
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:04.360]   I think there are some compelling development opportunities and just things happening in
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.280]   South America.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.900]   And there are some interesting citizenship options in South America, depending on how
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.400]   much time you're willing to spend on the ground.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.080]   Nothing is fast, but in South America, I think one of the big benefits is Mercosur.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.760]   If you're able to establish a citizenship for your children in a Mercosur country, that
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.180]   opens up basically all of South America to them.
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:34.760]   And there are a number of different countries that would serve very effectively in that
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:38.240]   context.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.240]   You have Argentina, you have Paraguay, you have Uruguay, Brazil, obviously the powerhouse
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.920]   of South America.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:49.320]   If you are going to do birth tourism, Brazil is very high on the list of countries to consider
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.400]   for birth tourism.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:57.400]   Brazil offers currently a fast track to citizenship for family members of a Brazilian citizen.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.480]   So if you have another child, and if you have that child in Brazil, that child would be
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.360]   Brazilian by birth, a Brazilian citizen.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:10.760]   And then you and your children would qualify for Brazilian permanent residency, which you
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.000]   could just maintain residency.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.520]   That allows them at any point in time to live and work in Brazil at any point in the future.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.640]   The key thing I would point out to you is you don't have to have citizenship to have
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.360]   economic opportunities for your children.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.720]   You need residency.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:33.760]   And so even with just with permanent residency, you could open up those doors to your children.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.040]   Now in Brazil, the law is that after you acquire residency, which is relatively immediate after
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.320]   the birth of a child, the law is that if you're a resident, a permanent resident for one year,
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.600]   then you can file for citizenship.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.360]   I don't know how long they're going to have that law, but that is currently the law.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.040]   The practice, however, Brazil being very bureaucratic, is it's more of basically a four-year process
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.640]   than a one-year process.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.960]   There's a major difference between the efficiency of the Canadian government and immigration
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.400]   processes versus Latin American governments and immigration processes.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.840]   But Brazil, I think, would be a really interesting and exciting opportunity.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.520]   Brazil also has benefits because it's a very diverse society.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.320]   So if you're white, you can fit in well in Brazil.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.880]   If you're black, you can fit in well in Brazil.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.200]   If you're brown, you can fit in well in Brazil.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:25.260]   There are tremendous opportunities and there's a very strong Brazilian, European communities
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.480]   in Brazil.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.880]   Now one thought is there's a special relationship, obviously, between Portugal and Brazil.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:37.320]   So what I would do before I would do Brazil is I would investigate the future opportunities
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:42.080]   of somebody with a Portuguese passport and how easy it is for them to immigrate to Brazil.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.200]   It's probably easier on a Portuguese passport than anything else in the world.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.340]   I don't know the details of that.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:52.560]   There are some other interesting countries in South America.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.160]   Colombia is one of my favorite countries in South America.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:04.520]   Colombia is just an incredible place and has a very really powerful economy.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.840]   I really love Colombia.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.640]   So you can set up, if you're willing to take some money, you can get Colombian residency
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.920]   just simply through purchasing real estate in the country.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.680]   I think that can lead to a passport in time through naturalization.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.220]   Now you need to be thoughtful about your tax obligations here.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.480]   But since you're living on investments, those tax obligations should be fairly minimal.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.840]   And since you continue to be a Canadian tax resident, they should also be minimal just
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.020]   regard to what you have with Canadian residency.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.320]   But I think Colombia is a really interesting option.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.560]   There are other countries in South America that are also interesting.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.480]   Chile has a wonderful economy.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.620]   It's a really incredible country, a really diverse country.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:51.800]   You could use, because Chile is in South America, if you wanted to set up a lifestyle where
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:55.560]   you spent half the year in South America and half the year in North America, you could
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.240]   either choose to live in perpetual winter or perpetual summer, whichever you prefer
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.960]   based upon the difference in seasons.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:08.000]   You can live very inexpensively in Argentina, especially southern Argentina.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.080]   And so if you wanted a place that had a high quality of life and low cost of living, that
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.940]   would be a country to consider and you can become an Argentinian citizen in time.
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:26.720]   Almost all of the countries in the Americas offer citizenship by birth, birthright citizenship.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:36.960]   So all of those could be options for another child, but not all of them offer a fast track
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   to citizenship.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:43.200]   But you have the years and so you could become in time naturalized for your entire family
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.600]   in South America.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:48.880]   And there's some very high quality of lifestyle places.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.600]   Uruguay is a very modern European culture.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.760]   You would probably feel very comfortably in Uruguay, a lot of benefits.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.320]   Don't ignore Mexico.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.280]   Mexico has tremendous benefits, extremely powerful passport, fairly simple immigration
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280]   procedures.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.000]   You can naturalize in time.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.080]   If you have a child in Mexico, the child will be by birth Mexican and then you and your
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.520]   entire family can qualify for permanent residency in Mexico.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.840]   And so again, you could naturalize as a citizen, but you don't need to.
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:23.300]   You could just simply have a permanent resident visa and gain access to the Mexican marketplace
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:27.080]   in the future, which I think will be very powerful.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.720]   Now let's move out of the Americas.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.600]   You have obviously the Caribbean.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.120]   There's certain benefits of the CARICOM alliance there, but that's less interesting to most
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:40.800]   people and you can always buy yourself a Caribbean citizenship if you think it's worth the money.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.720]   Europe, I think has some interesting options and here's where we get to diversity.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.440]   One of the things that where your passport lacks or your passport portfolio lacks diversity
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.520]   is on big countries versus small countries.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.320]   That's not too bad with Portugal, but still EU, big country, big government, etc.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:06.920]   It'd be nice if you could develop a passport citizenship from a place that had a smaller
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:11.040]   government influence and it also would be nice if you could develop a citizenship from
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.160]   a country that was friendly with a different set of countries.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.620]   So if you look at the world's countries, there are often groups of them that are friendly
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.620]   with one another.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.440]   So the United States and Canada, very friendly with one another.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.300]   If you, you know, you commit a crime or something, US and Canada extradite people all the time.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:31.120]   Now that's different than the relationship between the United States and China or the
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.680]   United States and Russia.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:38.240]   And so different regions of the world control and exert influence on other areas.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.640]   The US influence is almost impossible to escape throughout all of the Americas, especially
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.920]   Central America.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.440]   You just can't believe that the United States is going to let something happen in, you know,
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.840]   I don't know, Costa Rica, right?
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.400]   Costa Rica famously doesn't have a military, which is great, right?
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   But one of the reasons why they can get by without a military is because the United States
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.080]   has proven time and again that they're just not going to let anything happen that they
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.600]   don't want to happen in Central America.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.640]   And so in some ways the Central American governments, yes, they are independent and they do their
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.680]   best to be strong and sometimes bristlingly strong a la Nicaragua.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.560]   But at the end of the day, they're pretty much subject to what the United States allows
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.680]   to happen.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.540]   There's long proof of that.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:27.280]   And so one of the things that I would consider would be to go and establish myself under
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.580]   another government that would be interesting in a different part of the world.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:37.960]   So for example, Russia would be a really interesting thing for you to do to emigrate to Russia.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:44.040]   The Russian economy and the Russian state is a really fascinating place.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.820]   Moscow, one of the world's great cities, really.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:51.760]   Very advanced culture, very just high culture.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.720]   You can do—Russia is such a huge country, you get tremendous opportunities.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.320]   Depending on what you're willing to do, you could emigrate to Russia.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.640]   Russia has some economic immigration options that can lead to citizenship in fairly short
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:09.560]   order, potentially as short as three years.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.040]   And so if you were willing to make some investments in Russia and move some money into the Russian
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.240]   economy, that would be an interesting thing for you to consider.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.840]   And there are a lot of nice things about Russia.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.640]   You can live very inexpensively in Russia and it would be pretty neat if your children
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.720]   had the ability to access some of the Western nations, but they also have the ability to
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.040]   access a nation like Russia.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.200]   Russia has a very low tax rate.
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.880]   It can be a major tax savings for some people.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.080]   Again, that's not such a big concern for you, but that is a real option.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:48.280]   You could also think about some of the countries that have access to Russia very easily.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.160]   So for example, Serbia is a really interesting solution.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:56.540]   The Serbian passport is one of the very few passports in the world that gives you visa-free
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:02.400]   access to both Russia and to China, which is something that you don't have with either
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.480]   of the passports that you currently have options to.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.720]   You don't have visa-free access to either of those powerhouse nations.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:13.560]   And so a Serbian, you could establish residency in Serbia, leading to citizenship in about
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.040]   five years within Serbia.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.640]   Serbia also has Belgrade as a really neat city, very cultured.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:25.480]   If you wanted to live less expensively, there are many suburbs and whatnot outside of Belgrade
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.920]   that could be just really nice places to be.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:31.680]   And so you could think about a place like Serbia.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.200]   Then we move towards kind of the Middle East and to Africa.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.400]   So in the Middle East, there are really minimal options for citizenship.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.720]   The Middle East and Asia are much more race-focused than Western nations.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.400]   And so it's much harder, if you're not born Saudi, you're not going to become Saudi.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.080]   Like Dubai, right?
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.840]   Incredible city, could be a very tax-efficient place for an expat to live, but you're not
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.220]   going to become a citizen of Dubai.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:01.920]   The best you can get is establish permanent residency and keep it.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.020]   And that's fairly open, but you've got to stay there and you've got to keep it.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:09.440]   But you could investigate that because there are economic opportunities in the Middle East.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.680]   I think the most interesting place to consider going in the Middle East, it's not technically
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.360]   Middle East, kind of on the border between Europe and the Middle East, but Turkey has
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.120]   a citizenship by investment program that requires you simply to buy real estate.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.840]   So if you're willing to invest in $250,000 of real estate inside Turkey, you and your
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.560]   entire family can become Turkish citizens.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.480]   And that's the kind of opportunity that would start to diversify your passport portfolio,
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.660]   because although it may not be super helpful with regard to travel privileges, you've already
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:43.300]   got travel privileges, where your passport portfolio could benefit, would be working
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:47.920]   with a smaller country and also potentially working with a country that's not quite in
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:53.640]   the same kind of Anglo-Western United States, Great Britain sphere, like you are with Canada
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.840]   and with your Canadian citizenship.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:01.040]   So Turkey is kind of on the border of the EU, wants to be part of the EU, but it's still
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   different.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.800]   It has more of a connection to some of the Arab cultures.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.120]   And that potentially could be something that could even make you money.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:14.680]   So you go to Turkey, you purchase $250,000 of real estate in Istanbul or elsewhere.
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680]   You can rent that real estate out.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.240]   You don't have to live in it, or you could live in it and just enjoy living in Istanbul,
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.600]   traveling around that region from a home base, doing slow travel.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.180]   And the citizenship process is very quick.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:30.320]   The requirement is that you purchase the real estate, $250,000 of real estate or $500,000
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.080]   deposit in a local bank.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.200]   And then three years of, you maintain it for three years, then after three years you can
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   sell.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.520]   And so if you can buy inexpensively and then sell at a profit, you could possibly make
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.560]   a profit by adding another citizenship to your passport portfolio.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.440]   Then we move to, from there let's move into Africa.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:54.440]   Now Africa is interesting because I think there are, there's potentially a lot of opportunity.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:58.720]   If you look at the areas where population growth is likely to come in the next few decades,
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.420]   most of it is from Africa where you have a very high birth rate.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.800]   And I think it's going to be really exciting to what happens in many different African
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.240]   countries and cultures.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.440]   There are some challenges.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:14.080]   Now in most countries, many countries in Africa you can immigrate and you can naturalize to
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.640]   be an African citizen of that country.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:24.720]   So you would have South Africa would be one to seriously consider, a South African citizenship.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.880]   There's obviously a stronger connection between, are you and your family white?
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.880]   Yes.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.560]   Okay, so there's an easier connection of being a white South African than necessarily
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.200]   being a white citizen of Namibia.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.600]   There are far more white South Africans than there are white citizens of Namibia.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   So South Africa would be something to consider.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.280]   But there are other interesting countries in Africa as well that have a lot of longer
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.120]   term potential.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.120]   What I think would be one of the very interesting ones to consider would be off of the African
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.960]   continent itself, but a country like Mauritius.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:03.080]   There are lots and lots of South Africans that are moving to Mauritius, given the economic
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.800]   troubles especially for white people in South Africa.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.380]   Many white people are leaving South Africa and looking to go to other places.
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:14.600]   The reason I say Mauritius is because Mauritius is also an interesting option for a passport.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:20.240]   It's one of the other very few nations in the world that has visa-free access to Russia
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.720]   and to China.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:31.640]   And it would be a real diversity of a passport for you and for your children that is an African
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.240]   passport.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:38.120]   Now Africa is not particularly difficult to get to for the passports that you already
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.360]   hold, but it would be interesting to have an African passport and especially that African
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:45.920]   passport could open up more interesting opportunities for your children.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.400]   What are the economic prospects of Mauritius?
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.520]   I don't know.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.840]   Not nearly as exciting to me as something like the economic prospects of Nigeria, but
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:00.800]   there's a big difference between an island tropical paradise in an African island versus
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.280]   a place like Nigeria.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:07.520]   Nigeria certainly has much more powerful economic prospects, I think, in the coming decades,
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.000]   but it would have a very different lifestyle.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.940]   So do you actually want to live in Nigeria?
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:14.600]   Do you actually want to pursue that or do you actually want to pursue naturalization
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.480]   in Kenya or an African country?
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:19.080]   Those things are much more difficult.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:24.320]   Now to wrap up, I missed whole swaths of Asia.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.160]   Malaysia is, I think, a really neat option for your children if you want to expose them
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.160]   to some Asian influence.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:37.080]   Thailand is obviously a place that lots of people like to be.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.920]   In many ways the world is open to you, but those are just some thoughts that occur to
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:45.000]   me and so you're going to have to consider what you and your family actually like.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.280]   If you don't actually like a certain culture, let's say you just don't like Russian culture,
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.760]   you don't want to learn Russian, well then Russia doesn't seem like a great place to
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:59.240]   pursue, but maybe you would love living on a tropical island of Mauritius.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:02.880]   On the other hand, those places are far from Canada and so if you're going back and forth
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.840]   between Canada and there, you got a lot of money in plane tickets, it's quite a ways
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:13.600]   and so it's a lot easier for you to set up shop in Costa Rica or Panama or Mexico than
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:18.200]   it is for you to go back and forth between Mauritius and Canada.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.600]   But those are just some ideas talking through some different regions.
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.560]   What I would emphasize is you don't necessarily need citizenship for your children in order
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.700]   to open up economic opportunities for them.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:33.400]   You can do that with residency and so you can establish residency with birth tourism
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.780]   and that can be a part of the overall package.
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:40.200]   So if you're going to pursue citizenship, I think it makes sense for you to think about
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.160]   the diversity and to focus on a region of the world that you think has genuine economic
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.800]   prospects and then move in that direction.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.680]   Thank you very much Joshua.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.640]   That was very thorough and I believe you can consult on this.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.120]   Well good, I do enjoy the topic.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.080]   It's interesting because it's so fascinating when you start to sit down and think about
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:04.360]   where do I think the world is going, what opportunities do I want for my children to
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.280]   have and then how do I balance that with all of the practicalities.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:17.320]   But I do think I love the topic and whether it's through financial independence or through
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.420]   remote lifestyle, through homeschooling, it is pretty cool in the modern world to be able
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:24.880]   to establish multiple options all around the world.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.000]   All right, we've got two callers left on the line.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.480]   Let's go to Abilene, Texas.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.000]   You've been extremely patient.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   Welcome to the show.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000]   How can I serve you today?
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000]   Sorry man.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   Hey Joshua.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000]   My name is Corey.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000]   Can you hear me?
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   Yes Corey, sounds good.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000]   Go ahead please.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   Hey, so I had a question about long-term care insurance.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.080]   I recently, I've been a long time listener but this is my first time to call and based
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.520]   on some of the stuff that I've learned from you over the years, recently I actually quit
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.480]   my job as a principal because I read John Taylor Gatto.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.480]   Thanks for that.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:56.480]   Great.
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:02.680]   And we thought about homeschooling for a long time and after I was actually in the public
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:08.280]   school system, I decided that the position I was in, it wasn't going to be socially acceptable
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.680]   for me to stay and to homeschool.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.280]   So we decided we're going to try something different.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.800]   So I got out of the public school system and right now I'm trying to flip houses and we've
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.680]   got plenty of savings to tide us over but we're trying to keep our expenses low because
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:26.280]   I'm trying to get this business to actually make money.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.320]   But basically my question, my wife asked me to call you.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.320]   I'm 34.
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.320]   I'm in good health.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.520]   I'm married with three kids and should I buy long term care insurance?
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:37.880]   Like is that something I need to be thinking about and looking at and if so, what do you
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.880]   recommend?
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.160]   About how much is your current net worth?
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:49.400]   I'm in about a half million dollar range.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.600]   And other than just simply being a prudent forward thinking planner, you're not, there's
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.800]   no current reason to think that you would need long term care insurance at an early
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   age.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   Correct.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.440]   So nothing that I can think of.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.320]   It's just thinking of risk planning.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   Right.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.640]   I don't think it makes sense.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:17.160]   Now ironically I'm 34 and I own some long term care insurance but that was more to do
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:21.480]   to the fact that I sold it and when I sold long term care insurance there was a change
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.200]   happening in the marketplace.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.520]   When long term care insurance was first designed you could purchase very generous policies
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.080]   with unlimited lifetime benefits.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:39.120]   So you could say I want $5,000 a month and then if you got early onset Alzheimer's at
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:46.320]   40 years old and let's say you needed 30 years of care, you could potentially get millions
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.560]   and millions of dollars out of the benefit.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:55.000]   Now when I was actually an insurance agent what I found is that again and again, what
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.760]   I found was that the marketplace was changing and so one by one all of the companies that
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.120]   sold long term care insurance systematically dropped their lifetime benefits and then the
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.680]   change that happened before that is you could actually purchase something that was called
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:15.040]   a cash, blanking on the name, a cash purchase or a cash balance payout.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.960]   So let me explain.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.680]   Generally the way the long term care insurance policy works is that the policies, cash indemnity
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.680]   that's the word, the policies are reimbursement policies.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:27.360]   Let's say you buy a policy and it has $5,000 a monthly benefit.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:33.880]   The way those policies work is if you have $3,000 of expense they'll reimburse you $3,000
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.720]   but they won't reimburse you the other $2,000 if you qualify based upon the activities of
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.480]   daily living which is the triggering language in the policy.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:48.720]   If the policies also, if you have $5,000 they'll reimburse you $5,000 of expenses.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.060]   If you have $7,000 of expenses they'll reimburse you $5,000 of expenses.
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.280]   But they're reimbursement policies that reimburse you for actual expenses incurred.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.880]   Now those policies have the ability to, you can sometimes use them in some interesting
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.880]   ways.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:10.380]   So for example it is possible that if I got, let's say I get early onset Alzheimer's disease,
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:16.120]   it is possible that my wife could go and get a license to be a nursing aide and she could
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.140]   go and get a job with a home health organization and her job she could be paid by that company
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:25.140]   to live in my house and to provide my care.
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:28.680]   There's nothing illegal about that as long as the money funnels through a nursing home
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.680]   agency.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.060]   It would have to be paid to a company.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:36.200]   And so obviously it wouldn't be a huge amount that she would be getting but there are some
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.080]   ways that you could use it for that.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.320]   Now that's a reimbursement policy.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.880]   There were, especially in the early years of long term care insurance, there were cash
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:46.120]   indemnity policies that were available.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.520]   And so the way the language in those works was if you qualify for long term care based
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.480]   upon needing help with two of the six activities of daily living, which is the contract language
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.960]   in a long term care policy, if you actually needed help and care, then the policy would
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.080]   just simply pay you out a stated sum of cash regardless of how the cash was used.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.640]   So if your policy benefit in that situation were $5,000, then no matter what you would
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.960]   get $5,000, whether you spent $3,000, $5,000 or $7,000.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.200]   So the first wave was those policies didn't work out.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.960]   They didn't underwrite them properly and so what happened is they phased, they pulled
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.560]   most of those policies from the market.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.160]   When I was an insurance agent, there was one company on the market that still had one of
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:33.040]   those that I sold I think twice to, and I sold those policies to wealthy young business
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.000]   owners who couldn't get disability insurance and basically it was kind of a stopgap disability
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.760]   insurance policy where if they got disabled, then they would possibly qualify for long
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:45.760]   term care benefit.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:49.600]   It wasn't as sure as a disability policy but since they couldn't get disability, this was
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.120]   kind of a stopgap thing for them.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.960]   And so that used to be available but since I haven't been involved in the marketplace
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.360]   a number of years, I don't know if those are still available.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:04.580]   But what I told those clients when I sold those policies, I said, "Listen, these policies
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:08.640]   are generally not underwritten well and so you need to view this company and this policy
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.360]   with suspicion and every single year, you need to just say how's this company doing
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.840]   because it was an abused section of the marketplace."
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:26.240]   So even when I sold it to them, I said, "This is probably only a temporary deal for you."
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.120]   Now back to reimbursement policies.
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:33.200]   The change that happened was the company started to experience such severe adverse selection
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:40.800]   that they started to pull those lifetime benefits from the marketplace.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.880]   And I was actually an agent at the time and we got advanced warning that they were pulling
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:47.960]   them and I sold, I don't know how many.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.400]   I bought one but I sold, I mean, dozens of them.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.960]   Maybe if I won, in one month I sold, I don't want to exaggerate but something like 50 or
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.760]   60 long-term care insurance policies.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.640]   I just called everybody that had ever been interested and I said, "Listen, this is being
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.640]   pulled from the market.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.440]   You can still buy it for another few weeks but that's it."
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.360]   And I sold dozens of them.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.840]   To my knowledge, I'm not aware of any company that's still offering them.
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.080]   If anybody listening is an insurance agent and you know of a company that's still offering
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:22.300]   this kind of policy, then reach out to me and let me know please.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.840]   But to my knowledge, all of those have disappeared.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:29.160]   Now that was an extensive background to say that the circumstances have changed.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:33.240]   So now the way that long-term care insurance works is it's basically a certain amount of
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:37.160]   money that you want to insure against this specific need.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:42.560]   And so the way it works is let's say you're going to protect $3,000 per month of expenses
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:45.300]   times 12 months for a total of 36 months.
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:55.720]   So the total benefit of the policy is 3,000 times 36 or $108,000 or it could be $6,000
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:56.720]   for 60 months.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:59.820]   Now your total benefit of the policy is $360,000.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:05.240]   And so what the policies do now is they largely hedge your savings against that amount of
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.240]   drawdown.
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.120]   So if you buy a policy that has a maximum benefit of $360,000, what that means is you
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.020]   don't have to spend $360,000 of your assets first.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.700]   You first go to the insurance policy, you take the money out of the insurance policy
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:25.900]   and then you go to your savings.
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:31.040]   So it's just hard for me to see that that's necessary for you being this young.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:34.960]   I every year I look at my policies and I think – I have one for me and one for my wife
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.000]   and I look at them and I think, "Do I really need this?"
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.720]   The problem is that I know it doesn't cost me all that much.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.560]   It's deductible through my business.
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.400]   Long-term care insurance is the best double deductible business benefit.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.400]   It's deductible as a business expense and the benefit is totally tax-free.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:55.680]   That's the only insurance payment that works that way in the marketplace, in the tax world.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.440]   It doesn't cost me all that much.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.760]   I started with a very modest benefit.
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:01.360]   Mine continues to grow with inflation.
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.280]   The premiums grow little by little.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:08.280]   I look at it every year and I think, "Well, I probably don't need this but I do like
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.960]   to have it and it just makes me feel good."
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:15.180]   I can't get disability insurance because of the nature of my business and my travels
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.180]   and whatnot.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:20.400]   So if I had disability insurance, would I still have it?
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.800]   Probably, but because I don't have disability insurance and I can't get it, even though
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:28.320]   I'm the world's biggest fan of disability insurance, I just look at it and say, "Well,
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.880]   I'll keep this."
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.480]   But would I tell you to do it?
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.480]   Probably not.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.960]   Now, that was so I don't think you need it.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.080]   What I would say is focus on getting wealthier.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.560]   If you are going to, if you are still interested in long-term care insurance, what you should
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.400]   do is you should investigate a hybrid product.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:49.680]   So what has happened in the marketplace, the long-term care insurance has gone through
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:53.360]   a couple of iterations and one of the things that's happened is there's been a development
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:58.440]   of a lot more hybrid products that mix a life insurance policy with a long-term care insurance
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:02.240]   policy and I think those are interesting.
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:06.400]   I don't love them because I like insurance to be a little bit purer, but for someone
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:11.200]   in your situation, if you are genuinely interested, I think you should investigate something like
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:16.040]   a hybrid policy because there's far less of a chance of you just paying out, paying out,
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.080]   paying out and then never being able to get the money because it'll go out in some form,
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.160]   either in the form of a long-term care benefit or a life insurance benefit.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:27.240]   But long-winded way of saying, "No, I don't think you need it.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.800]   I would just focus on getting wealthier."
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:29.800]   >>Toby: Awesome.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:30.800]   Thanks so much.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.800]   That's very helpful.
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:32.800]   Yeah, that's exactly what I needed to know.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:33.800]   You've been talking for three hours and I have a second question.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:34.800]   >>Toby: Go ahead.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:35.800]   >>Jeffrey: If you wanted me to ask it, I will.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:36.800]   Are you sure?
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.800]   >>Toby: Go ahead.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.800]   Go for it.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:39.800]   Yep.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.800]   >>Jeffrey: All right, man.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.800]   Okay.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:42.800]   So I'm investing in real estate now since I'm doing the house flipping thing and we've already
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:43.800]   got a couple of rental houses and I was thinking about, I listened to your asset protection
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.800]   series.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:45.800]   They're currently both in my name because they wouldn't give me a loan unless they were
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.800]   in my name.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.800]   So I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:48.800]   >>Toby: Okay.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.800]   >>Jeffrey: I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:55:13.800]   I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question.
