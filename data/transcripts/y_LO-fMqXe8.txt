[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Well, Pastor John, you are known for writing biographies.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.640]   I think you have 27 biographies written
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.840]   and preached to date,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.880]   and those biographies are all very popular downloads
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.760]   at DesiringGod.org over the years,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.760]   and they've been published in what is now
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.120]   a series of seven volumes in a book series titled
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.920]   "The Swans Are Not Silent,"
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.080]   which is being published by our friends at Crossway.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.160]   In light of that project, here's a question.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.240]   Quote, "Dear Pastor John, my name is Christian Lee,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880]   "and the biographies you have done in the past
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.260]   "have been some of the most life-changing experiences
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.280]   "for me.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.360]   "I was wondering how you do your research
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.520]   "and how you go about getting all your resources together.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.700]   "Also, will you be writing any more biographies
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.780]   "in the future?"
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.740]   - I really would like to encourage others
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.740]   to do what I have done in those little biographical talks
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.200]   that I give,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.640]   namely tell the life story of some Christian
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   in a way that inspires others to love Christ
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.000]   and gives them insight into perplexing aspects
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880]   of the Christian life
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.760]   and motivates them to follow Jesus,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.080]   no matter what the cost.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.580]   That's what I would like to encourage others to do,
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.680]   even now as I'm answering this question.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.160]   One of my reasons for doing those biographies
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.880]   for about 26 years or so at the Bethlehem Conference
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880]   for Pastors is to model for pastors
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.760]   how they could do the same thing for their own people,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.640]   like on a Sunday evening service or on a Wednesday night
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.960]   or in a youth group or at a retreat setting
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.120]   or something like that.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   So I would be eager to answer this question
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.000]   with the same aim.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.520]   I'd like to motivate people to do it.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.320]   I hope others will do these kinds of talks.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   It does take a lot of work.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.080]   And so I think people need to be persuaded,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.780]   if you're gonna be motivated to do a lot of work,
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.680]   you need to be persuaded it's biblical to do it,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.480]   it's profitable to do it, and it's enjoyable to do it.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.980]   So let me take those one at a time.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's biblical.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.880]   Hebrews 13, seven, "Remember your leaders,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.700]   "those who spoke to you the word of God.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Consider the outcome of their way of life
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   "and imitate their faith."
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.000]   Wow, what a mandate for reading biography, right?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.360]   Christian biography.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780]   Or Hebrews 6, 12, "Don't be sluggish.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.900]   "Be imitators of those who through faith and patience
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.520]   "inherit the promises."
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.440]   You ever seen anybody live the Christian life
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.020]   all the way to the end and triumph over all the sins
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.560]   in their lives and make it to the end?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.760]   Well, be like that.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.080]   Study that life.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.280]   Or Philippians 3, 17, I love this
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.880]   'cause it's got four generations of imitation in it.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.820]   "Brothers, join in imitating me and fix your eyes
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.820]   "on those who walk according to the example
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.080]   "you have in us."
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   Four generations, Jesus, Paul imitating Jesus,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.560]   those who walk like Paul,
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.360]   and us watching those who walk like Paul.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.560]   That's four generations of imitation.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.000]   So wow, this is really biblical.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.320]   So the Bible gives us encouragement
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.660]   to look at the lives of believers
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.320]   and imitate their faith and patience.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.560]   And the assumption is now that it's profitable.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.840]   I don't think the Bible would encourage us to do it
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.200]   if it weren't profitable, and it really is profitable.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Watching someone live a lifetime with Jesus
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.000]   is incredibly inspiring and enriching.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.520]   Biography is such an efficient way of study.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.880]   It's like it's got history, it's got theology,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.780]   it's got psychology, it's got counseling, it's got politics,
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.900]   it's got economics, it's got geography,
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   it's got devotion and piety, all wrapped into one good book.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.020]   So it's really valuable to our faith and life and thinking.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.040]   And thirdly, yes, it is enjoyable.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   I mean, who doesn't love real life stories?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.920]   And so a good biography is enjoyable.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.280]   So how do I go about it?
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.360]   So please know now, in the rest of what I'm saying,
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.940]   this all really reflects my weaknesses.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.720]   Really, weaknesses?
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.920]   Everybody does things to compensate for their weaknesses.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.780]   It's what we do.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.400]   We figure out how to live with our weaknesses.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.960]   So what I'm gonna describe is what I do,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.820]   you can do it differently, maybe.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:56.200]   First, pray like crazy for help.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.840]   You can't do anything without God,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   and so pray, pray, pray, pray while you're doing it,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.940]   otherwise you will just spin your wheels,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.520]   waste your time, nobody will get help,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   they'll just have their imaginations titillated
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.540]   and you won't do anybody any good if you don't pray.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.540]   Then I choose one or two biographies to read,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.320]   not five or 10.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.360]   That's a weakness.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.600]   If I had time, I could read 10, I'd love to read 10,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.760]   but I can't, so I'm gonna read one or two.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.040]   I begin that reading, or I used to begin it,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.020]   on vacation in July,
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.200]   before I was gonna give the talk in January.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.480]   And I would give the lecture then
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.680]   at the Pastors Conference in January,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.360]   and I tried to read at least a scholarly biography,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.280]   if one existed, and an inspirational biography,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   because frankly, neither of those
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.660]   has any corner on the market.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.660]   The scholarly biography often misses things,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.360]   'cause they're so bent on being scholarly,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.320]   and the inspirational one,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.200]   while seeing some glorious things,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   misses other things that the scholarly biography,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.240]   precisely because he's so focused on facts
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.480]   and cultural relationships that he spots things.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.520]   So I just think it's great if you can find
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.480]   a great biography of a scholarly type,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.280]   and one that's more inspirational.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.800]   And I read these very carefully, slowly and carefully,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.000]   marking them with pencil as I go,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.480]   keeping a running index with little short index thoughts
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.860]   in the front fly leaf of the book,
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.140]   with page numbers indexed to those thoughts,
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.900]   if you use Logos for reading your books,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.540]   I know Tony, you're a big Logos fan,
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.340]   I love, I mean, I would do things very differently today
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.420]   with Logos books available.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.380]   If you do Logos, the indexing that you're able to do
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.780]   in the quote gathering is enormously easier
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.180]   than when I used to do it.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.340]   Then, let's see, what's next?
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   I read as much as I can of what that person himself
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.740]   has written, so important, letters, sermons,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.940]   books, essays, autobiography, journals, diaries,
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.500]   anything you can get your hands on
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.320]   because original sources are 100 times more important
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.220]   than secondary sources for getting the real,
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.060]   true deal of the person.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.660]   And I mark those up, same way.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.740]   If I could get paper versions, I marked them up
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.660]   and put the indexes in the front.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.660]   Now, by this time, usually some focus or theme or angle
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.420]   has arisen in my mind that I want to focus on.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.620]   You can't just tell a life in general,
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.860]   you got to have a point or a focus.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.300]   It's just too broad, it would be pointless
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.780]   to try to tell somebody's story with no point.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.220]   I mean, like, literally, I mean, people would go out
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.260]   and say, "What was the point of that?"
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.820]   And you would just maybe have told
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.100]   a few interesting anecdotes and everybody would wonder
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.620]   why you did that.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.620]   So I think it's, for my purposes anyway, I want a point.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.580]   So I have zero pretense to being unbiased
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.060]   in my presentation.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.620]   I am choosing a theme from their life
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.980]   and I make that the point of the message
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.660]   that I'm gonna give and it really is a message,
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.180]   not a lecture.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   I saw myself as driving home a biblical point
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.420]   about God or about life with God.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.000]   I was preaching a biblical truth,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.980]   only 95% of my sermon was illustration.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.820]   (both laughing)
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.680]   It's like, it's called the biography.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.740]   That's really what I was doing.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.380]   I'm unashamed in that.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.940]   I mean, it's not the way a scholar would do it,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.780]   I know that, but I'm preaching.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.660]   I'm trying to make a point about something
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.260]   like Luther's love for the Bible
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.220]   or Calvin's commitment to hard work
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.180]   and his view of the sovereignty of God
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.020]   or something like that.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.720]   Now, with the biographies and some primary writings,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.780]   and believe me, it was limited.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.620]   I was not comprehensive.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.820]   I began to assemble quotes from all that material.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.740]   Now, before Logos existed, I would dictate
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.540]   into my computer with drag and dictate for Mac
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.000]   or in the earlier days, the PC,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.240]   I would dictate hundreds of quotations
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.380]   from the biographies and from the works
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.340]   and I was influenced in which ones I dictated
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.100]   based on my indexed, my front fly leafs,
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.020]   I was influenced by the point I was going to make.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.040]   And while I was doing this, ideas would come to my mind
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.420]   about the things I was quoting
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.540]   and I would dictate those ideas as well.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.700]   Now, when all of that was in the computer,
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.860]   there would be about maybe three or 400 entries
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.540]   in different paragraphs.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   So each one was a paragraph.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.900]   And then I put that entire document,
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.220]   maybe 60 single pages in the cursor,
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.900]   that's a single space, single space pages,
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.300]   60 single space pages.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.860]   I would put it in the cursor of Microsoft Word
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.700]   and I would click at the top to tell it to number
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.820]   all those paragraphs.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.820]   So it created a list and every paragraph now had a number.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.060]   And now I maybe have 60 pages of single space,
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.300]   300 plus quotes and ideas.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   And then I would read through this new document
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.500]   that I created and I would index those 300 paragraphs
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.380]   according to topic.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.220]   And I would be able to narrow it down to maybe,
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   oh, I don't know, 100, 60, 60 ideas.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.620]   And for example, one of my little ideas might be
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.500]   Martin Luther on the authority of scripture.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.980]   And beside that, I might have 10 numbers,
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   one, 36, 210, 301, referring to those paragraphs.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.860]   So now I've clustered all the quotes in all my reading
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.820]   relating to that issue into a new index.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.540]   And then I would do that one more time
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.540]   and distill my 100 topics down to a handful.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.780]   And that more or less became what I started writing with.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.980]   And then I wrote and I cut and pasted
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.500]   from those quotes into the document.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.980]   I printed it out, I marked it up, I prayed like crazy
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.500]   and I went over and I gave my talk and I loved it.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.820]   I loved all the reading, I loved the composition,
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.280]   I loved the delivery.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.920]   I recommend it to pastors or anybody else,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.440]   school teachers or friends.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.480]   Question, will I do more?
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.060]   Well, I still read biography for sure.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.540]   I'm reading biography now.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.860]   We will see whether that or any of my reading
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.620]   finds its way into new biographies, that remains to be seen.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.260]   Yeah, well, without making any promises here,
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.740]   who are the key figures
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.460]   that you haven't gotten around to yet?
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.760]   Wesley, John Wesley.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.100]   I think I owe Wesley, even though he's not a Calvinist,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.880]   I think I owe him one.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.300]   John Knox, I never did.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.600]   And I think that's worthy.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.060]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, never done.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.820]   Okay, that's enough.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.760]   Well, those all sound really great.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.320]   Preached biography, may this tribe increase.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.680]   And you can find all 27 of Pastor John's biographies

[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.760]   We appreciate it.

[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.080]   Well, body image is a preoccupation for many,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.680]   such as it is for a man named John
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   who lives and works in Washington, DC,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.760]   and who wonders about what's really motivating him
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.400]   to get to the gym.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.020]   Body image and self-glory.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.460]   That's the topic on Wednesday when we return.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.460]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.780]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:30.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
