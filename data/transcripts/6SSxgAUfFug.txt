[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]   Okay, so I'm standing here with Dr. Stuart McGill, who's an expert in the back, back
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.700]   strengthening and relief of back pain.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.740]   And he's going to tell us about the structure of the back in terms of where it derives its
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.700]   stability from, where pain can arise, and various routes by which to relieve that pain.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.500]   So why don't you explain to us what you're holding here.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.100]   It looks like an anatomical model of a piece of the spine, spinal cord and pelvis.
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.220]   That's just about it, professor.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.200]   If I was to align this on yourself, that's where it sits.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.460]   So there's your pelvic ring.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.740]   There's joints called the sacroiliac joints from behind, where when a person does a split
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.060]   lunge, for example, one side mutates forward, the other side mutates back, and you can see
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.600]   the micro movements that occur in the sacroiliac region, which may be healthy, or they may
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.760]   cause pain.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.180]   So those are fairly small movements.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.180]   So they look like they're on the order of millimeters.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.180]   Is that right?
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.180]   About a half a millimeter.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.780]   Okay, so tiny movements.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:19.660]   They're micro movements that, as I said, could cause symptoms or they indicate good health.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.040]   This creates a platform for the lumbar spine.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.620]   So as it's orientated this way, if you were to pick something up, the force is supported
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.060]   down this middle of your body through the spine.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.360]   So it needs a platform to be supported by.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.820]   So you can imagine, I'll just place it on me, if I was going to stand on one leg, the
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.420]   force is driven down the center of my torso, but then it has to shear across to the support
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.420]   leg.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.620]   So the tendency of the spine is to bend like that.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.020]   So now you see the importance of the lateral muscles on this side to hold the pelvic platform
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.000]   up and then the hip muscles on this side to start, you see my hip is trying to collapse
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.500]   because of gravity.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   So there's a lot of moving parts in how all of this works.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.660]   So as far as the spine goes itself, you know, the hips are ball and socket joints, but the
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.980]   joints of the spine are actually what we would call an adaptable biologic fabric.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.740]   So just as my shirt has fibers, these have fibers of collagen layer upon layer, which
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:42.500]   allow movement to occur, but they also apply or provide stiffness so that the spine is
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   inherently stable for very small loads because it has discs.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.700]   So we have the vertebral segments and then the discs in between them.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.420]   And then what people see here are the nerve roots emanating from the spinal cord.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.420]   Right.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.300]   The spinal cord starts in the base of your skull and goes down the middle of the spine
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.780]   through what's called the magnum foramen, the big hole down the middle.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.340]   And at each level where there's a disc, there's a pair of nerve roots that come out laterally
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.900]   to serve different parts of your body.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.660]   So if this nerve was compromised here, that's the fourth root on the left hand side.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.200]   This goes around behind your hip joint, down your hamstring, down your calf and serves
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.460]   the small four toes.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.340]   So if you had irritation by bending your spine a certain way and said, well, my little toes
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.220]   just went numb, we would know with some precision that that's the culprit that with that precision,
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.140]   that nerve right there.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.420]   What are some of the sources of impingement on that nerve?
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.580]   I could imagine the disc bulging at this location is one potential source.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.060]   I could imagine a shearing motion that would put it in contact with some of the bony elements
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.140]   in here.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.540]   What are some other sources of impingement on the nerve?
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.540]   Well, exactly those two.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.540]   Let me demonstrate.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.200]   We're just going to do a do-si-do there with the two models.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.500]   So this is a more detailed anatomical model of just one segment.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.540]   You'll notice that the spinal cord traverses up and down.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540]   So as you look down, it migrates the cord cranially.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.100]   So it's pulling the spinal cord up and because it actually laces through these bony elements,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.060]   the spinal cord is literally sliding up.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.060]   It is.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.300]   And if you were to kick forward with one leg through the hip with a straight knee, it would
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.300]   do the opposite.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.380]   It would pull the cord that way.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.180]   But now look at the migration and the mechanics of the nerve roots.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.500]   This is sliding up and down about two centimeters or for my American colleagues just over, well,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.220]   getting close to an inch.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.460]   So it's quite a distance, quite a translation.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.980]   You can imagine now if something was rubbing that nerve root, it would irritate it with
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.980]   the motion.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.940]   So your question was, what are the candidates?
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.420]   Well, when a person is younger and if they get a disc bulge, we're just going to show
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.740]   a disc bulge here, inside the disc is a nucleus which is gel.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.180]   It's a very thick gel.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.140]   And when you squeeze the spine or I bend and pick up an object, we put compressive load
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.900]   onto the disc.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.700]   And if we're stacked nice and tall, you'll see the disc sees the compression as you can
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.140]   imagine it would in a very sort of a shock-absorbing manner.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.460]   But now I'm going to bend the spine forward and squeeze.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.740]   Do you see there was a delamination or a little bit of a damage and delamination of the fibers
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.880]   that we described earlier, they separate as the person bends forward and then the squeezing
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.860]   pressure creates a hydraulic effort through the delamination and you see the disc bulge
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.540]   just starting to occur with the nuclear gel.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.200]   And then as the person keeps moving in excess, now if you just move, we did a study on belly
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.180]   dancers who have tremendous gyrations in their spine, that didn't create delaminating stresses
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.020]   because there was no large compressive load.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.360]   So motion for the spine without load is not particularly a bad thing.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.700]   But when you add compressive load, now you've pressurized the nucleus and it's pushing
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.780]   from behind those fibers.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.680]   So now you're bulging them out a little bit.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.340]   Now you can start to see how they'll separate.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.140]   And if my thumb is the gel, it's seeking the crack to come through.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.980]   And then that creates the disc bulge, which is a combination of motion, usually bending
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.200]   forward with compression.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.060]   And on a previous episode that I did about back strengthening, I mistakenly said that
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.460]   the spinal cord threads through a compartment in the disc.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.460]   It does not.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.460]   We corrected that.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.980]   I should say in the show note caption, the spinal cord is posterior to the disc, correct?
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.980]   - Correct.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.060]   - And does not course through it, but is just adjacent to it.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.500]   And the disc is however, in a position to impinge on these nerve roots if it gets extruded.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.200]   And in some cases to push the nerve root against some of the bony elements causing what we
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.420]   call pain, right?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.660]   But the pain doesn't necessarily occur at the level of the root.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.580]   It can occur at the level of innervation or further down the neural pathway.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.320]   - The pain can go wherever the nerve root goes, exactly correct.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.260]   So now if we start to move the nerve, the central spinal cord or at this level, it's
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.060]   called the cauda equina, it separates into separate roots.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:51.420]   But nonetheless, do you see how that root now moves as a function of your hip motion
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.060]   and your neck motion?
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.580]   So now you're frictioning the nerve past the mechanical offense.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.780]   So it creates varying types of local pain and radiating pain as well.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:11.700]   - So if there is a disc bulge and it's impinging or somehow otherwise causing pain by compressing
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:18.580]   one of these roots, irritating one of those roots as it were, what can be done to return
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.700]   some of that bulge back into its proper location?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   - Avoid bending the spine forward, which is the primary driver of causing that disc bulge
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   to grow.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.340]   Now, not of every disc bulge.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.000]   It tends to work better in younger people.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.180]   So I'm just going to slide my hands down my thighs, but notice I'm flexing at the hip.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.660]   I'm not flexing through the spine.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:51.460]   If you can flex at the hip, and here might be a therapy, if I just grab my knees hard
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:57.420]   and then I shape the curvature of my spine, then I push my toes down and I become a leaning
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.020]   forward over my ankles, and now I anti-shrug.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.620]   Do you see what I did, Andrew?
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.700]   I carry more weight.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.640]   I'm showing you my triceps.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:12.220]   If I organize that right, that can actually be a disc bulge reducing procedure.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.620]   - Interesting, because when I had this L4 disc bulge, the suggestion to me was to do
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:26.100]   cobra pose or something similar, to lie down on the floor, point my toes out, so toes and
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.700]   tops of feet and legs are in contact with the ground, and then to push up and essentially
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.560]   to arch the spine, and then to repeat that, 10 or so cobra push-ups, as it were, and then
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.420]   to hold the final one for maybe 30 to 60 seconds, and then to get up and return about my day
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.020]   and to do that several times, and it worked fabulously well.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.180]   - That works fabulously well for certain types of disc bulges.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:59.180]   We did experiments on this, and if the disc original height or 70% of that height or more
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.460]   is remaining, that works very well.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.500]   If you flatten the disc so it's lost, it's about 60% or less of its retaining height,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   that won't work.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.780]   In fact, that will probably cause more pain, so that, it's called the McKenzie prone press-up
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:21.700]   or the cobra pose, can be very effective with the rider of how much disc height is remaining.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.380]   But another concern occurs.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.340]   Some people think, "Well, that was an effective therapy for that disc bulge for two weeks.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.380]   I'm going to do it every day for the next year."
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.540]   Now we run into a problem.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.880]   The disc is now a little bit flatter.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.140]   These facet joints on the back are two articulating joints.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.680]   There's the motion that they're undergoing during the floppy push-up, as it's called.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   - The cobra push-up.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.280]   - The cobra push-up.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.180]   Because the disc is now lost height, you've now biomechanically transferred much higher
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.640]   load to those facet joints, and they become irritated.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.280]   So before, bending forward under load caused your pain in the disc bulge to grow, but now
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.920]   bending back causes pain from the facet joints, which is another distinctive pain.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.280]   We can arch back, drop one shoulder back, and, oh, yeah, you can feel that local ache
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   there.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.880]   So those are a couple of issues to be aware of.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.320]   We did another experiment where we mimicked the floppy push-up versus simply holding it
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.640]   isometrically.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.480]   And the isometric pose doesn't cause the movement irritation of the facet joints.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.960]   In terms of returning the disc bulge, it was just as effective.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:46.020]   But following the same guideline again, 70% of the original disc height must be remaining
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.320]   for the isometric to work.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.140]   So there's some guidelines for you to make that exercise even more effective.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.600]   But you asked, what else could impinge on a nerve root?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:07.640]   Over time, as the disc becomes damaged, you now get more motion, and this is what we call
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.960]   an unstable joint.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.920]   That causes more load on the facet joints.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.240]   So let's do our do-si-do one more time.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   And this model has been prepared that this disc, the fourth lumbar four, is damaged.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.960]   L5 is normal, L3 is normal.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.400]   This is the joint that has lost stiffness.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.740]   Now people hear the word stiffness, and they think that's a bad thing.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:38.440]   But a joint has to have a certain amount of stiffness to provide support and define the
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.000]   range of motion.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.320]   So remember, this is the damaged joint.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.080]   I'm just going to apply a general torque above.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.260]   And you see how the majority, the overwhelming majority of the motion is occurring at the
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.800]   damaged joint.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   Not at the one above and not at the one below.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.760]   Now let's turn around and look at the facet joints.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.300]   They've been painted red.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.880]   Those are the joints that are working because of the disc damage.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.160]   So when we turn a little bit, we get a little bit of shearing motion.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.240]   If we turn a lot, that joint, that facet joint on the compressive side is overloaded, and
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.020]   that causes the whole upper vertebra to slide across.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.820]   Over time, that's going to encourage arthritic bone growth just at that level.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:28.900]   So another mechanism for the impingement on that nerve root is bone growth around the
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.360]   facet joint, which will make the hole even smaller.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.980]   So there's another source of pain.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:40.360]   The moral of the story is keep your discs as healthy as you can, and you'll have a better
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   life.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.400]   Well, that's okay.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.480]   So are there ever cases where one would want to attempt to return the disc to its proper
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   compartment?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.720]   In other words, to reverse or reduce the bulging of a disc where the proper movement would
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.840]   be the opposite of a Cobra push-up, where it would actually involve abdominal work in
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:11.080]   order to try and work back in the disc from the other direction, so to speak?
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.280]   "It depends," is the answer.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.840]   There's a real nuance to all of this.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.000]   So that's why we spend so much time on the assessment to define the precise nature of
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   the disc bulge.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.920]   And I should just mention that in the episode that we recorded with you, which we provide
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.440]   a link to in the show note captions, you described some of the assessment questions, self-assessment
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   questions.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   We talked about "Back Mechanic," your book, which fabulously describes some ways to self-assess
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.800]   and remedy, as well as a link to some of the clinicians that you've trained in the precise
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.280]   methods based on much of the work that you and others have done to address these problems
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   specifically.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.140]   Said long-winded, because as Dr. Stuart McGill has pointed out many times, the sources of
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:04.760]   back pain are many and varied, and the relief for back pain is both highly individual and
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   involves varied techniques, depending on the nature of the injury or the nature of the
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.080]   pain.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.240]   And there are a number of other factors, psychosocial, emotional, et cetera, that are also important.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   And we describe all...
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.920]   I should say Dr. Stuart McGill describes all of those in the episode linked in the show
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   note caption.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.940]   There's a time for surgery and a very specific type of surgery.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:32.880]   There's a time for a very specific type of exercise, be it mobility, stability, or whatever.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.500]   There's a time for pretty much everything.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.840]   The key is to match it to the...
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   I don't want to say injury, but it could be an injury.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.240]   It could be a sensitivity, et cetera.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.960]   But anyway, going back to this idea of there being a...
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.640]   That is now called a clinical instability that you can see.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:00.680]   If you could arrest that joint and restore its motion, so when you twist, the whole unit
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.080]   doesn't see the shearing joints, you do that through abdominal contraction.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.160]   So if I cued you and said, "Andrew, push my fingers out," yes.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.840]   Don't push your belly forward if you can.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.920]   Try and flare your oblique muscles out laterally.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.240]   That's the pattern.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.120]   And that will then arrest that micromovement and some people will...
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.560]   That will say it takes their pain away.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.360]   Is there ever a time to flex forward to deal with the disc bulge?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.400]   And the answer is yes.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.200]   The type of disc bulge that when you bend forward and the disc bulge is on the back
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.760]   of the disc is typical of a weight training kind of injury.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.080]   If you had someone with a very flexible spine, they don't lift weights, but they do lots
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   of yoga.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   Backbends.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.160]   They've adapted their spine for mobility, not for load bearing.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.640]   So the collagen and the ground matrix between the fibers have become very soft.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.720]   So whereas someone who was strength training, when they squeeze and bend forward, the disc
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:13.560]   bulge comes out posteriorly, someone with very soft constituency to the disc, it bulges
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.960]   on the front.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.360]   So it's a different type of bulge.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.620]   So it depends on how you've adapted your spine as to whether flexion will help you or extension.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:28.240]   So again, knowing with some precision, the mechanism of the pain or disorder allows you
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.840]   to match the intervention.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   Fantastic.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.680]   Well, this has been a wonderful description of spinal and pelvic anatomy discs and a very
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.720]   dynamic structure and yet a very stable structure in its best configuration.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.920]   What amazes my students is when I hand them a spine and I get them to with all their strength,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.320]   try and bend it and break it.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   They can't.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.120]   So it's incredibly robust.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:18:02.380]   But the things that we do to ourselves, creating long levers and doing what we do creates tremendous
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.280]   internal stress concentrations beyond what you could ever apply with your hands.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.860]   All the more reason to do the McGill Big Three on a regular basis that was also described
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.300]   and demonstrated in some other videos that we provide in the show note captions.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.400]   And of course, please be sure to check out the full length interview with Dr. Stuart
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.800]   McGill in which he describes in beautiful and immensely clear detail the structure and
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.040]   function of the spine and back, how to strengthen your back, how to get rid of back pain and
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   how to stave off back pain, not just after an injury, but your entire life.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.440]   And by the way, at this moment, he is 67 years old.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.640]   He's in awesome shape and an inspiration to me and anyone watching, I'm sure is equally
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.640]   impressed that he puts in the work on a regular basis.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.700]   And in that episode, he also describes his so-called biblical schedule, which is six
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:01.440]   days a week of fairly limited in duration training geared toward cardiovascular fitness,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.960]   strength and mobility.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.720]   It also includes a full day of rest.
