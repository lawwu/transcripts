[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.520]   Listen to ModCast, March of Dimes research podcast, today.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.760]   I believe that as human beings, we all share some things in common.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   And one of those things that I think we all share is an appreciation for the beauty of
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.400]   mothers and their babies.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   I've always loved to watch mothers feed their babies.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.720]   I just think there's just something really, really beautiful about it.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.640]   Now, you can pick your favorite image.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.800]   I like to see all kinds of different animals.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.240]   The funniest looking ones, I think, are often deer.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   If you watch deer feed her baby fawns, because they just are so alert.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.160]   They don't settle down and they're not domesticated.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.000]   So the head is up and their eyes are looking around and you get the sensation that at any
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.320]   moment this deer could snap and all of a sudden that baby has got to just race off after mom.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.480]   Goats, I think, are some of the funniest, just because the little kids are so awkward
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480]   and gangly.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.320]   Sheep are really cute.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   Cats are beautiful.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.920]   Dogs are cool to watch.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.640]   I like to watch cows, because little baby cows, they're funny.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.240]   And I always feel like the mama cows are at some point in time going to just kick the
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.760]   baby cow to get them to stop pushing so hard when they get their head underneath and they're
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.720]   sucking on the mama's udders and they get their head under there and they're just butting
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360]   and pushing against it.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.760]   And so I could very happily be a rancher and thoroughly enjoy that lifestyle.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.560]   But one image that's thoroughly etched in my mind is the image of a mother pig feeding
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.440]   her piglets.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.520]   Just picture in your mind's eye a mother pig feeding her piglets.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.920]   Just simply my saying those words will probably bring a relatively common picture to all of
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   us.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.400]   For me, the image that's indelibly printed on my mind comes from a James Herriot story
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.840]   that I had when I was a kid.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   My parents were shopping at Sam's Club one time when I was a kid and I would go along
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.460]   with my mom and we came across the book rack and I found this collection of James Herriot
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.680]   stories and just had beautiful pictures and I asked my mom to buy it for me and she bought
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   it for me.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.240]   I went home and devoured it.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.960]   James Herriot, for those of you who don't know, was a British veterinarian and he was
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.100]   born in the early 1900s, died as an old man, but he wrote some really neat stories based
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.520]   upon his veterinary practice.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.340]   And then somebody took his stories and in this case, put together a treasury of stories
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.160]   and the illustrations were beautiful.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.920]   The book opened up with him coming out in his little car to this farm out in rural England
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.080]   where a mother cow was having a difficult birth and so he was being called out to help
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   with the birth and delivery of the baby cow.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.820]   And he comes out and it's a cold blustery day and he comes into the barn and they wind
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.720]   up going ahead and they safely deliver the baby calf and then he's looking around the
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.960]   barn and finally after the hard work is done, he can appreciate the beauty of the bucolic
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.240]   scene that's all around him.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.400]   He's in a nice warm barn, it's clean, it's well kept, the farmer is a good farmer and
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.000]   he looks into one of the stalls in the barn and there's a mother pig lying on her side
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.960]   and of course, mother pigs often have very large litters.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.760]   So there's eight or 10 little piglets all lined up, right next to each other.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.360]   All feasting at their mother's belly and it's just something beautiful about that.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.720]   I always just thought that picture is really, really beautiful.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.640]   I think it's beautiful to watch mothers feed their babies, human mothers feed their babies.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.240]   I love to watch my wife breastfeed our children.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.320]   It's just something very, very special.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.960]   She tells me it's just a special, it's a very special experience that she really treasures
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   about being a mother.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   She really loves it.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's a bonding time, it's something that goes very, very deep for her.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.360]   And so I just like to see that, it's just something beautiful about that.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:38.480]   But there are times at which that scene, that idea of a baby suckling at its mother's breast
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.520]   is not so pretty.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.920]   Think to that image of the pig and now all of a sudden, let's say that instead of these
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.320]   cute tiny little pink piglets all lined up, suckling at the teats of their mother, now
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   all of a sudden they're not little piglets.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.520]   Rather it's 150 or 200 pound pig and there are a bunch of them all fighting to get their
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.600]   snout in there to get some milk.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.200]   Something a little disgusting about that, isn't there?
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.720]   You take this beautiful image and all of a sudden just by changing the age of the babies,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.120]   that image can be transformed from something beautiful into something a little bit revolting.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.840]   There was a Time Magazine cover a few years ago which featured on its cover a picture
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.740]   of a mother and her child.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.240]   Her child was feeding at her breast.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.760]   But instead of the child being a baby, the child was a three-year-old little boy who
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.900]   was standing on a stool and she was standing upright.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.800]   She had one breast exposed and the child was standing there on a stool next to her with
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.580]   his mouth on her nipple breastfeeding at three years old.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.720]   Now the cover was quite provocative.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.480]   I don't know that the subject was all that provocative.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.980]   The subject of the article was about attachment parenting which is very popular especially
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.280]   in crunchy parenting circles, attachment parenting for those of you who are unfamiliar with the
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   ideas.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.100]   It's got basically three tenets, all of which are designed to try to build a closer relationship
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.820]   between mothers and babies.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.940]   One is extended breastfeeding, so breastfeeding their baby not weaning your baby at one but
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.300]   continuing on to two or three or some people longer than that, two or three, four years
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.360]   old.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.820]   Extended breastfeeding, baby wearing is another tenet of attachment parenting where in order
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.320]   to stimulate more of a connection between the mother and the child, the mother wears
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.260]   the baby or the father wears the baby in a sling or carrier of some kind.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.780]   And the third tenet I believe is co-sleeping which is the idea that the mother and the
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.620]   child sleep together either physically in the same bed if possible or very, very close
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.420]   so as to build a deeper bond between the mother and the child.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.500]   I'm sure there's more to it than that but that's how I identify attachment parenting
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.780]   in my mind as far as those three major tenets.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.860]   And that was what the Times article was about.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:10.620]   But the picture caused no small controversy because it questioned that normal mother-baby
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.700]   relationship.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.900]   And instead of having a baby at the mother's breast, there was a little boy, a three-year-old
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.340]   little boy.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:28.220]   Now I have no desire to wade into the attachment parenting question or controversy.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.140]   So let me not put the picture as a three-year-old.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.160]   Now let's say that instead of a three-year-old son, you have a 20-year-old son doing the
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.820]   same thing.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.460]   I don't think anybody would claim that there's anything appropriate about the idea of a 20-year-old
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:58.420]   boy, excuse me, 20-year-old man suckling at his mother's breast.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.620]   I want to use these metaphors to paint a picture in your head while I tackle the subject of
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.980]   boomerang kids.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.240]   And my intention with today's show is to help those of you who have boomerang kids in your
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.020]   house to know how to get them out.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:26.060]   And number two, those of you who have young kids, to know how to keep them from becoming
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.140]   boomerang kids.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.320]   Last week on my phone, I flipped over to the Apple News Feed and the iPhone Apple News
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.900]   Feed and I saw a story there called "The Boomerang Kids Won't Leave" from the New York Times.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   Sorry, it's official.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.420]   "The Boomerang Kids Won't Leave" from the New York Times.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.300]   So I quickly looked at it because that's the kind of thing that is appropriate for an appropriate
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.540]   topic for radical personal finance.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.540]   And I copied it out.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.940]   I thought while I was doing the majority of the show prep that this was a recent article.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.700]   Then I realized when looking at the article further and doing my due diligence on its
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.300]   citation that it's actually from 2014.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.380]   So why it showed up in the Apple News Feed, I simply don't know.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:12.040]   But the article is all about the boomerang kids and how many young men and women are
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.060]   returning home to live with their parents.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:22.820]   Let me just read you a couple of excerpts from this article to set the stage.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.300]   Annie Kassinas has two different ways of explaining why at age 27 she still lives with her mom.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.060]   In the first version, the optimistic one, she says that she is doing the sensible thing
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.580]   by living rent free as she plans her next career move.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.500]   After graduating from Loyola University Chicago, Kassinas struggled to support herself in the
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.260]   midst of the recession, working a series of unsatisfying jobs, selling ads at the soon
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.280]   to be bankrupt Sun Times, bagging groceries at Whole Foods, bartending in order to pay
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.900]   down her student loans.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.620]   But she inevitably grew frustrated with each job and found herself stuck in one financial
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.400]   mess after another.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.020]   Now that she's back in her high school bedroom, perhaps she can finally focus on her long-term
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.340]   goals.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.320]   But in the second version, the bleaker one, Kassinas admits that she fears that her mom's
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   house in Downers Grove, Illinois, half an hour west of the city, has become a crutch.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.940]   She has been living in that old bedroom for four years and is nowhere closer to figuring
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.540]   out what she's going to do with her career.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.400]   "Everyone tells me to just pick something," she says, "but I don't know what to pick."
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:36.220]   One in five people in their 20s and early 30s is currently living with his or her parents.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   And 60% of all young adults receive financial support from them.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.060]   To emphasize that, one in five people in their 20s and early 30s is currently living with
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.280]   his or her parents.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.020]   And 60% of all young adults receive financial support from them.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.760]   That's a significant increase from a generation ago, when only one in 10 young adults moved
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.680]   back home and few received financial support.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.060]   The article goes on and is fairly lengthy.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.060]   It's worth reading.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.320]   In a previous version of this recording, I read the entire article and I realized that
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   it just slowed down the pace so much, so I'm only just reading that short excerpt here
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.700]   in today's show.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.100]   But I will link to it in the show notes.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.440]   And it's worth reading, because it does go through and talks about some of the benefits
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.180]   and disadvantages of boomerang kids and of what they're doing and how they're approaching
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.180]   it.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.300]   And by the way, if you hear banging in the background, my mic probably won't pick it
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   up.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.980]   But if you do hear banging in the background, it's due to South Florida shutting down and
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.080]   all my neighbors are putting up their hurricane shutters and boarding up their houses and
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.500]   whatnot in preparation for Hurricane Matthew.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.600]   And I'm recording this show in hopes of publishing it and getting everything out before we potentially
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.780]   lose power.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.020]   So that's the banging in the background for today's show.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:07.300]   The reason I started with that image though is I think that it's a good way for us to
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:14.220]   picture children and how we should work with children.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.780]   Now I want to start with my presupposition.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:26.540]   I define the presence of a boomerang kid in the way that it's pictured here, where 60%
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.900]   of young adults, and they did not cite their sources.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:37.540]   I have not reviewed the data to understand how that data was collected, what that's measuring,
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.540]   any of the background.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.440]   So I'm just simply going based upon that.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.540]   So my data here is very thin.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.780]   Just reading this New York Times article and assuming that it's well sourced.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.280]   But again, I don't know the definition.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.500]   But I don't think it's direction all that wrong.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.460]   But one in five young adults, 20s and 30s living at home with their parents and then
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.980]   60% of young adults receiving financial support.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:04.740]   So if I define a boomerang kid as a child who has returned home because of their own
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:12.100]   financial instability, I define that as an ugly thing.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.680]   And I'm not saying that there's not a place for generations to work together.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:25.240]   What I am saying is in the same way that the picture of a mother pig with her children
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.720]   is beautiful when those children are small and they're receiving the breast milk when
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.520]   they're small, but it's very ugly if those pigs were big.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   It's the same corollary in humans that is beautiful when we as mothers and fathers support
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.040]   our children when they are young.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.560]   That's what we should do.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.680]   But if our children are not independent and able to stand on their own, then it turns
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.520]   into something that's not quite so beautiful.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:03.700]   However, even though I hold that opinion, I do not believe that it's in any way problematic
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:10.520]   or disadvantageous or something not to be desired for adult children to live in a home
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.980]   with their parents.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.280]   And I want to give you a different metaphor to pull this out, sticking with the metaphor
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.960]   of animals.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.840]   So in the first metaphor, you have a mother nursing her young babies.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.540]   And if those young babies grow up, grow up, grow up, grow up and continue to be nursing
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.340]   at their mother's breast, that's ugly.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:40.840]   But if those babies grow up and become active members, useful members of the herd, even
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.040]   though the mother and the babies might live within the same tribe or within the same herd,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.900]   depending on what type of animal we're talking about here, that can be something really beautiful.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.480]   That can be something really useful.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.420]   I love to see elephants on nature films, nature documentaries.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.000]   I think elephants are cool.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.480]   I think they're cool because they're smart, but they're nearsighted and I share those
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   characteristics with an elephant.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.180]   I'm practically blind without glasses, but I like to think I at least can understand
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.480]   a few things about life.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.460]   Although, the older I get, the more I question that sometimes.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.480]   But elephants, as my understanding, work very well in a herd.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.200]   The babies grow up and then they are brought into the herd.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.280]   And if you've ever seen those pictures of the baby elephant crossing the river in Africa
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.200]   and the muddy bank that it can't get up and the big elephant reaching down its trunk and
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:38.400]   pushing up from the back or pulling the elephant up, that's the image of a herd working together.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.320]   It's not the relationship of a parasite.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.600]   It's the relationship of a community.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.420]   Parasitic relationships are ugly.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.680]   Community relationships are beautiful.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.840]   Now, I think community relationships can look different for different people depending on
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.680]   the nature and makeup of a particular community, obviously.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.920]   So I have no intention of prescribing a particular way that you and your relationship with your
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.880]   children should or should not look.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.920]   But I think it should look like a community and not like a parasite relationship.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.560]   Now sticking with the baby metaphor, it's important to note that there are transitions
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.040]   and there are stages of parenting.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:35.240]   And it's beautiful to support a small baby.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.620]   Babies need the support of their parents.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.160]   Babies and young children need the support of their parents.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.960]   Perhaps one of those things that just strikes us the hardest is when we come across baby
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.520]   animals in the wild who've been either abandoned or rejected by their parents, whether that's
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.840]   a bird that fell out of its nest or whether that's – I used to raise rabbits and sometimes
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.760]   you'd find the little rabbits, little kits that have been pushed out of their nest and
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.320]   their mother rejected them for some reason.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:11.080]   So it's so heartbreaking when people interact with animals in the wild and then they – because
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.360]   the baby animal is tainted with human scent and it goes back to its mother and its mother
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.880]   rejects that animal.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.620]   There's something really heartbreaking about that.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:26.680]   And we know instinctively and intuitively that babies – baby humans deserve our protection
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   just like baby animals do.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:38.720]   A normal healthy parent will always prioritize the well-being and the good of their child
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.220]   above and beyond their own well-being.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.280]   We know that there's something incredibly ugly about a parent who tramples upon their
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.520]   child so that they can get ahead.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   So we know that babies need care.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:00.120]   And the same thing when we look to the financial lives of our children, our children need care.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.960]   But again, that care can't continue for too long.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.420]   So how do you make a transition to where if you have a boomerang child, how do you help
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.720]   that child to leave?
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.400]   First and foremost, I believe that begins with recognizing that what you are doing to
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.940]   enable your child is a very ugly thing.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.240]   If you are a father, picture your wife doing this.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:38.280]   If you're a mother, picture your 25-year-old son or daughter, 30-year-old son or daughter
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:45.840]   walking up to you, lifting your shirt up and asking to breastfeed as an adult.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.520]   It's a revolting concept.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:59.960]   And yet that's often what we do as parents by financially supporting lazy, shiftless,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.240]   undisciplined leeches we call our children.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:17.200]   If you are financially supporting bad habits of your child, you are not helping them.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.360]   The animals have this figured out.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.120]   I understand, I guess it's in the eagles.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   I've read stories.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.640]   You never know whether to believe the inspirational stories that you read.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.680]   But I've read stories where the eagle, what, at some point starts pulling out feathers
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.120]   from the nest and tries to make the nest uncomfortable.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:41.820]   If the eagle can do that, if that's true, how much more you as a parent?
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:49.680]   Your job as a parent is to raise your child to maturity, to where they can be an independent,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.860]   self-sustaining, autonomous human being, aka an adult.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.720]   And one of the most difficult things about our society is that we have taken this concept
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:09.160]   of childhood and we've extended it far beyond any reasonable, normal understanding of childhood.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.960]   I was interested to see that this was even talked about in the New York Times article.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.520]   I'll read you a paragraph on it here from about the fifth paragraph, a little lower
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.720]   down than that.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.920]   Reading from the New York Times article, "Childhood is a fairly recent economic innovation.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.400]   For most of recorded history, a vast majority of people began working by age four, typically
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.840]   on a farm, and were full-time by 10.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.320]   According to James Martin, a historian at Marquette University and the editor of the
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.680]   Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth, it wasn't until the 1830s, as the US economy
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.480]   began to shift from subsistence agriculture to industry and markets, that life began to
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.820]   change slowly for little kids.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.800]   Parents were getting richer, family sizes fell, and by the 1850s, school attendance
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.720]   started to become mandatory.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.000]   By the end of the Civil War, much of American culture had accepted the notion that children
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.600]   under 13 should be protected from economic life, and child labor laws started emerging
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.520]   around the turn of the century.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.360]   As the country grew wealthier over the ensuing decades, childhood expanded along with it.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.560]   Eventually, teenagers were no longer considered younger, less competent adults, but rather
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.720]   older children who should be nurtured and encouraged to explore."
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.040]   End of the quote that I'm reading.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.320]   Now, I'm not opposed to childhood.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.600]   Childhood is fantastic.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   Childhood is beautiful.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.480]   And I think that when possible, we should work with our children to help them to use
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.200]   childhood to their advantage.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.280]   Childhood should, if you read the educational experts, one thing that many of them agree
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   on is that childhood should have a large amount of uninterrupted freedom to be able to explore
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.380]   and to process things and to develop unique characteristics.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.520]   So childhood is great.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:03.080]   But adults who act like children are not great.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.520]   So here's the question.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:14.240]   Is your adult child who's living with you a parasite on your life?
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:24.080]   Or are they a valuable member of your home making contributions to your household economy?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.940]   The point is not where they live.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.960]   The point is what's the nature of the relationship.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.640]   Let's talk about option one, your child is a parasite.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.240]   If your child, no matter the age, is a parasite on your family life, you need to work on a
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:50.700]   plan where you can systematically and in an appropriate way help them to mature.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.840]   The way that you help somebody to mature is you progressively put more responsibility
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.800]   onto them as they are able and capable of bearing it.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.700]   That means that you don't go from years and years and years of bearing with somebody and
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.760]   doing everything for them and then all of a sudden just toss them out on their ear unless
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.300]   they're violating the moral rules of your household or they are violating the authority
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   in your household.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.100]   In that case, toss them out on their ear.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.940]   If they're going to live in your home, they need to respect the rules of your home, especially
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.300]   if they're an adult.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.100]   But generally, that's probably not the best course of action.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:38.180]   But if you recognize that your child is a parasite in your life, you need to help them
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.780]   to not be a parasite.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:46.100]   You may have weaned them 25 years ago from your breast, but now you need to wean them
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.740]   from your checkbook.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:55.020]   So I recommend that you start that process because the sooner you start the process,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:02.900]   the better it will be for your child and for their self-confidence.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.020]   You have a unique opportunity to hear from somebody who is right smack dab in the middle
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.020]   of this generation.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:13.820]   I'm 31 years old and I have many friends who are living in the reality that this article
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.300]   talks about, the economic instability, blah, blah, blah, all the challenges and all the
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.860]   problems.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.460]   I will tell you this, from speaking firsthand with many of my friends who are boomerang
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:32.860]   kids or who have been boomerang kids, your economic outpatient care is destroying their
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.540]   self-confidence and it's delaying the maturing process unnecessarily.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.920]   It's destroying their self-confidence because they haven't figured out how to be an adult.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:51.140]   They don't have the autonomy that they desire to have because they feel like they're a leech.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.420]   None of us like to be a leech on another person.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.360]   And so for their own good, start the process of helping them to be a leech.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.340]   First and foremost, put household responsibility on them.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.500]   That should probably include rent, but if the child is not yet capable of rent, they
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.020]   can work their rent off.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.140]   So begin with some simple things.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.540]   They can do their own laundry.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.020]   They can do their own cooking.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.020]   They can do the housework.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.300]   They can do the yard work.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.380]   Figure out what an appropriate rent is.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.400]   Most areas of the United States, probably about $500 a month to rent a bedroom, somewhere
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.180]   in that range, and figure out $500 a month worth of activities and duties and work that
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.300]   they can do for you that will help them to be able to feel like they're actually earning
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   their keep and start assigning them those tasks.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:43.980]   If they don't want to do it, let them go, aka usher them out, because it's far better
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.660]   for them to face contact with the world where they can learn to make it as an independent,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:56.780]   autonomous, self-sustaining human being, aka an adult, than for you to continue to have
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:05.000]   them suckle at your teat until they're old and wrinkled.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.400]   So a good way to do that is start giving them responsibilities and helping them create a
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   plan.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   It's also wise to put some financial pressure on them.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.080]   Many people find that when there is financial pressure on their bank account balance, they
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.040]   can magically come up with better jobs, better work.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.520]   There is not really a shortage of employment out there for those who are willing to work,
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.000]   but there's a tremendous shortage of employment out there right now in our economy currently
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.680]   today for those who are unwilling to work or who are unwilling to work hard.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.240]   Hard work is good for their soul.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:47.600]   And so if your child is a parasite, help them have motivation to enter into the world of
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.540]   hard work.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.240]   You will be doing them a favor.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.560]   Good way to do that, if you're already doing chores and things like that, a good way to
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.480]   do it is to go ahead and start charging rent.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.320]   Give them a warning.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Meaning one month from today or two months from today, you owe me rent of this amount.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:15.920]   If your child is not at least paying you rent or a token rent, they're sucking off of your
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.760]   bank account and they feel bad about it and you feel bad about it.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.800]   The whole idea of the boomerang generation is a very ugly idea.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.560]   Excuse me.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.240]   I had to pause my recording here.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.600]   A neighbor came needing some help with the hurricane shutter.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.880]   So and I apologize, I didn't make a note.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.240]   So I can't continue the perfectly the train of thought here.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   So forgive the interruption.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.200]   At least I'm getting some work done in the middle of the hurricane or in the middle of
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.840]   the preparation for the hurricane.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.440]   So the summary here on this section of the show is this.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:56.360]   If your child is not contributing to your household, you're not serving them.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:03.560]   You're not helping them and you need to help them by placing responsibility onto them.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.360]   I think you should be wise in how you do this.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.480]   It's very easy to all of a sudden feel like, "Well, I'm just all of a sudden going to flip
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.360]   out and put a ton of responsibility on them all of a sudden."
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.440]   Well, if you haven't trained a child for responsibility, I think that would be very unwise.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.960]   It could even be traumatic.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.440]   Many people have all of a sudden had to face significant responsibility in their lives
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.320]   and usually it seems like they come up with a way to deal with it.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:39.480]   But that experience is not always without trauma and you have no desire to inflict trauma
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.020]   on your child.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:47.120]   But begin the process now of steadily moving with a vision to put responsibility onto them.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.760]   Have a vision of perhaps a year, perhaps two, something like that where systematically,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.200]   steadily, in a sensible way, you're going to put the appropriate amount of pressure
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.960]   on them until they are a contributing member of your household.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.440]   If you have failed in the past at putting responsibility on them and training them to
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.160]   be responsible, you may have to start with baby steps.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.040]   But start where you are and begin that process.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.280]   Believe me, your child will thank you.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.960]   Now, we need to expand the discussion just a little bit because just because your child
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.000]   is living at home does not mean that they're a leech.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   And I always see these discussions confused in articles and it was even confused in this
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   article.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.520]   For example, this article from the New York Times goes on and talks about how a lot of
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.240]   these children have high amounts of debt.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.040]   It talks about how they're making less money, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   It talks about how they're doing all these things.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.640]   But then at the end, it comes in and talks about how living at home with your parents
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.880]   might help them to do a startup and start a new business.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:01.680]   I think it's perfectly reasonable and even laudable as a parent that you have a desire
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.400]   to help your child.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.260]   And I think it's perfectly reasonable and laudable that you may even help them financially.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:14.120]   And helping a child financially, probably one of the healthiest ways to do that is to
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.840]   help by defraying – help them to defray some of their expenses.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.920]   If you start giving money, that comes with its own set of baggage.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.960]   If you start just simply giving things, that brings its own set of baggage.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.000]   But if you give something that for you is a little bit costly but not too costly such
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.400]   as subsidized or free housing, that can be really beneficial because it can help them
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.040]   to address their budget and lower their budget in order to do something like start a business,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.840]   in order to do something like go to college.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.560]   That can be really beneficial and it can be really healthy.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:52.640]   But what you're looking for is a sense of responsibility and an industriousness and
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.400]   a productivity on behalf of your child.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.880]   If those things are present, then the economic aid is probably not hurtful to them.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.960]   It's probably simply helpful.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.280]   So look to see what is your child actually doing.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.560]   In my own experience, I can attest to this from my own personal entrepreneurial endeavors.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:23.600]   I grew up in my parents' household of course and I lived at home with my parents until
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   I turned 18.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.760]   I spent the first year of my college life living on campus.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   The university is about 20 miles away from my parents' house.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.520]   The second year of my college life, I didn't have the money to live on campus and so I
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   moved home.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.440]   The deal that my dad made for me was that his way of helping me with college would be
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:50.520]   that he would subsidize my rent if I lived at home during college.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.800]   So I don't think I paid any rent during that sophomore year.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.920]   Went back to – in my junior year, I studied abroad the first semester, dropped out for
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.000]   the second semester.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.440]   During that time, I moved back home with my parents.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.440]   I was working full time plus.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.240]   I was working about 60 hours – somewhere between 50 and 60 hours a week in the agricultural
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.880]   industry.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.560]   At that point in time, I was paying rent I think.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.120]   I don't remember for sure but I'm pretty sure I was paying rent at that time.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.600]   Then my senior year of school, I went back, lived on campus and I moved back home after
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.320]   living on campus.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.480]   When I moved back home, I again took up paying rent, reasonable, $500 a month but it's
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.960]   helpful to my parents and helpful to me.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   So I picked up paying rent.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.560]   Then fast forward a year and a half when I began my business with Northwestern Mutual,
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.680]   I knew that going into that, the cost was going to be very, very – the pay was going
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.560]   to be relatively low.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.100]   So I paid rent for as long as I could but then I ran out of money and I was still struggling
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.480]   to get the business going.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.040]   So I went several months without paying rent, four or five months, something like that,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.880]   without paying rent until I was stable again, had my business working and then at that point
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.760]   in time, I was able to pick up paying rent.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.280]   I paid rent from then on until I married and I moved out of my parents' house when I
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   married.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:17.680]   So the point is not that you have to be a tyrant but you do have to see and make sure
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.920]   that your child is actually doing something that is productive, that they're actually
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.320]   building character.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:34.560]   If all those things are there, then it's perfectly reasonable to make choices if you're
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.360]   going to help them start a business and that's perfectly reasonable not to spend the rent
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.820]   money.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.440]   But if you don't prepare them, they're at home by paying rent, etc., paying their
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.440]   bills, they're not going to be ready to move out.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.600]   Now what if you don't need the money?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.960]   If you don't need the money, you should still do it.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.520]   I don't care if you put all the rent money aside into a separate account and then give
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.100]   it to your kid as a wedding present or whatever when they're gone and out of your house.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.720]   But the point is that the benefit is of paying those bills.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.600]   I struggle to share some of my own personal experiences because I don't want to seem
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.080]   like I'm tending towards arrogance or trying to think that I have it all together.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.480]   So hear me clearly, I don't.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.840]   But I do see very clearly that the level of character and discipline that I have is very
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.320]   different than many of my peers.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:36.800]   And I see some of these things, these formative experiences as being involved in that.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.440]   When I began driving, my dad's rule is you can start driving but you're going to pay
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.720]   for your insurance.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.120]   I've never not paid for my own car insurance.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.800]   I've never not paid for my own car.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.360]   I could borrow one of my parents.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   I was expected to contribute some towards the fuel of that, although I must say that
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.520]   during some of my broker years, my dad was very generous to make sure that I had fuel
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.720]   in the car on occasion.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.480]   And when it became time that I needed a car, that was on me.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   I paid for all of that.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.400]   But I've also done my own laundry since I was very young.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.920]   So there are other ways of expressing responsibility that don't involve rent.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.000]   The point is that these things were helpful to me.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.920]   These things helped me and they gave me a much higher degree of confidence.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.760]   When I compare that to some of my friends whose parents have enabled them, have supported
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:36.240]   them and who have artificially extended their childhood up through the age of 30, and then
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:43.440]   I talk to them and I pick up and see the challenges of confidence that they're facing.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.600]   Confidence is not a pretty thing.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.640]   So as parents, our job is to work with our children and help them.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.320]   And helping them involves placing responsibility on them.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.300]   Now you're the only one who can assess your own parenting.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.820]   You're the only one who can assess the details of the situation.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:10.240]   And there is an appropriate balance between complete permissiveness and complete authoritarianism.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.400]   Either of those leads to problems.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.920]   Autopsyism can lead to hurt and bitterness.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.520]   If your kids think that you're just after their money and you're using them to get rich
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:29.600]   and build your retirement account at their expense, that can lead to a lot of problems.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.720]   So you have problems both ways and you need wisdom in your particular situation.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.480]   But work with the idea that you're going to build maturity.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.560]   Maturity comes from bearing responsibility.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.400]   The second question I want to answer is how to keep your kids from becoming boomerang
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.880]   kids because many of you listening don't have adult children.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.640]   You don't have children in this circumstance.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.880]   Well, the way you keep your child from becoming a boomerang kid is a couple of things.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:09.000]   Number one, you put this responsibility on them and you do it from an early age.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.400]   I personally am convinced with my own children, time will tell, but some of the ideas that
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.200]   I have is a fewfold.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:23.600]   One, my goal is starting at about the – by about the age of 12, I want them to be fully
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.560]   trained to handle all of their own financial transactions.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.520]   What that means is I owe them a duty of parental care and support.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.960]   That duty would involve things like clothing, food, et cetera.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.200]   Now food is provided here at the household.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.400]   Clothing is a little bit different.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   But my vision is that by about 12, they will be fully responsible for their own clothing.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.840]   Instead of me going and buying it for them, I'll decide the appropriate budgeted amount
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.960]   and I'll give that to them and they're responsible for providing their own clothing.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.400]   One of the things that I think we as parents can and should be doing is giving our children
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.320]   the opportunity to make economic choices and spending decisions before they've been able
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.400]   to earn all the money themselves.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:13.120]   So as much as possible, I want to take all of the money that I would be spending on them
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.720]   and transfer it over to them, put it under their stewardship.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.240]   The things that I'm responsible to provide for them as far as their care as a parent,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.840]   I want them to be responsible for actually doing the transactions.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.280]   That helps them to be able to learn while it's simple and easy and the stakes of the
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.000]   consequences of failing are small.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.520]   Any bill that I can think of that's appropriate and probably the simplest one would be something
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   like a cell phone.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:46.120]   I know many parents view cell phones as mandatory equipment for all four-year-olds, but I don't
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.160]   personally hold to that, especially in my circumstances in life.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   If you feel differently, that's fine.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.480]   But something like a cell phone, I think an appropriate time to get a cell phone is when
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   you can pay the bill.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:01.800]   If it's cars, if they're not all using Uber and self-driving cars completely when my kids
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.120]   are older, it'll be things like cars, car insurance.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.880]   Those are all responsibilities that need to be borne.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.360]   Now you'll have to assess as a parent, just like I will have to assess as a parent, the
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.660]   changing nature of the world.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.320]   Is a cell phone for a requirement?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.720]   Is it a safety need?
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.800]   Well, if so, then I'm probably going to provide it.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.160]   I'm not going to expect my four-year-old to pay the iPhone bill.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:34.440]   But perhaps that is appropriate for the 13-year-old.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.560]   So the earlier you start placing responsibility and the more you work at placing responsibility
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.400]   on the children, that'll keep them from becoming boomerang kids.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:50.080]   That'll keep them from coming back to you as an adult child and expecting your financial
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.640]   support.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   Again, I define a boomerang kid as an ugly thing, but I don't believe that adult kids
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.460]   who live at home is an ugly thing.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:14.760]   So think about what your vision of a herd looks like, because I really like that metaphor,
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.120]   the metaphor of a herd.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.560]   That's what I think about when I think of my children, meaning that each person in the
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.520]   herd is an independent, autonomous person.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.280]   But my goal, my vision with parenting is that the herd is moving in a direction together.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   And I invite my children to move in that direction with me.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.400]   Any member of a herd can choose to leave the herd.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.760]   I'm not being strictly faithful to this metaphor to try to say that it's all about living at
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.560]   home and you're out of the herd if you're out of the house.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.760]   The point is I want to be moving together.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.560]   I want to be building collaborative relationships.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.760]   I want there to be synergy in our family.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.320]   In my family, I don't want there to be my life and your life.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.560]   I want there to be our lives, not to cross the barriers of personhood.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.280]   It's important to respect those barriers.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.240]   It's important to give autonomy, but that we don't have to be enemies when we grow up.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:20.000]   I'm convinced there's no need whatsoever for children to pass through the stage of being
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.480]   enemies with their parents.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.040]   There are some consistent reasons why that seems to happen and those, many of those can
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   be avoided.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.640]   Not all, but many of them can be avoided.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.880]   So one of the reasons that you wind up with boomerang kids, however, is because the children
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.720]   don't have something to aspire to.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.880]   They don't have something to grow up into.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.560]   So as a parent, the first place that we should be looking is at our own lives and considering
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.000]   our own example, considering our own testimony.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.600]   If I as a parent teach my children that the purpose of life is my own happiness and that
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:05.520]   happiness is defined as self-indulgence, then is it any surprise that if given the opportunity
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.560]   they can come and live in my basement, rent free and play video games all day long and
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.120]   have work 10 hours a week just to have a little bit of spending money?
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.520]   Is that any surprise or is that an expression of the vision that I've given to them because
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.160]   they've seen me model that?
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.840]   If I'm living a life of maximum self-indulgence, why would I ever expect my child to do anything
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.440]   other than to live the life like mine?
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.960]   If I struggle to work on a plan and to gain the benefits of a job, even though it may
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.880]   not be perfectly suited to where I want to be forever, but all I do is complain about
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.360]   it, then why would I expect my child to do anything else about it?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.860]   If it's good enough for dad and mom, it's good enough for me.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.440]   So therefore, it's fine if they stay unemployed or underemployed because they just haven't
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.480]   found the right thing to do yet.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.220]   In many ways, one of the most humbling things about parenting is the recognition that for
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:08.640]   good or for bad, we can usually expect our children to turn out just about like us.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.720]   And so change, dealing with boomerang children, probably doesn't necessarily need to start
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   with them.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.740]   It probably needs to start with us, we who are parents.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:26.960]   And if we desire to avoid having boomerang children, we probably don't start necessarily
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.320]   with learning some new parenting technique or learning for some new thing to do.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:41.040]   It probably starts with assessing what type of leadership are we giving?
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.880]   Am I living for fun?
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.480]   If so, my child is going to live for fun.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.320]   Or am I living for purpose?
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:54.000]   If so, my child might live for purpose.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Am I living for self-indulgence?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.400]   If so, I could probably expect my child to model my example.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.760]   Or am I living for others?
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.720]   If so, I can probably expect my child to live for others.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:16.400]   So as we close the show today, consider your life.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.240]   Consider the outcome of your life.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.200]   Are you living a life of maturity?
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.920]   Are you giving your child something to come up to?
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.640]   Something to aspire to?
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   One of the major trends I've noticed in my life is it seems like adults have somehow
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.960]   decided they want to be more like kids than give kids something to be something...
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.280]   Let me try again.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:48.640]   It seems like adults have decided that they want to be more like kids than that they want
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.000]   to give their kids an example of what an adult is to be like.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.920]   A few months ago, I went to a special event that was held at a big mega church here in
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.720]   West Palm Beach.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.040]   It was a special event and I went to this big mega church building and the pastor came
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   on stage.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.520]   And this pastor's in his late 40s.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:23.720]   He came on stage and he bounced up on stage wearing skinny jeans, tennis shoes, sneakers,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.080]   whatever, fashionable athletic footwear, and one of these little shirts with a hoodie built
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   in.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.320]   I looked at him and I said, "Are you trying to look like a 22?
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.080]   If a 22-year-old wants to dress that way, fine."
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.840]   But I had to work very hard to maintain my respect for him just simply based upon the
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.480]   way he was dressed.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.280]   And it seemed to me, "You're trying way too hard.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   Why don't you give the people here an opportunity to aspire to be like you?"
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.680]   Here where I live in West Palm Beach, it seems like the mothers want to dress more like their
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:06.160]   16-year-old than that they want to give their 16-year-old a way to dress.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:11.000]   I'm sharing this simply because that's something I was convicted on recently and I thought
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.120]   to myself, "Am I giving my children an example of the way an adult dresses and the way an
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.040]   adult behaves?"
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:26.480]   So consider the example that you're setting for your children and recognize that if you
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:33.940]   want to get your boomerang kid out of the house, it's going to be as simple as you systematically
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.920]   starting to put the pressure and the responsibility on them.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.000]   And you'll either be able to get them out of the house in the way that they say, "Hey,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.040]   this is too much and I'm going to leave," or my preferred way, you get them out of the
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.320]   house in the sense that they're no longer a leech but now they're a valuable part of
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.680]   your community.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.640]   Bring them into your herd, the herd that is going somewhere.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.480]   Help them to become an active contributing member of the community.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.400]   Now they'll matriculate out at a different time.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.000]   When they marry, they'll matriculate out and they'll begin a new household.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.320]   That's the appropriate order.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.360]   That's the appropriate model.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:18.120]   The Bible teaches in Genesis 2, it says, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.320]   be joined to his wife."
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   There's got to be a leaving.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.080]   It should be an establishment of a new household.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.160]   Just because your adult child is living at home doesn't mean they have to be a leech.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.400]   Thank you for listening to the show today.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   Hope these thoughts and these ideas are useful to you.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.600]   I just want to encourage you that if you are a parent of a boomerang child, it's not hopeless.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:41.640]   The world is different than it was when you were in your child's situation, but it's not
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.960]   harder or easier, this New York Times article notwithstanding.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   It's different.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.320]   The point is that there's a different value system and it's your responsibility as the
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:57.920]   parent to be the parent.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.640]   That means starting with your own example and then actually behaving and acting like
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   a parent.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.320]   And if you are a parent of younger children, work to build your children up, to help them
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:13.180]   to be responsible members of your household and to develop a common vision for your family
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.880]   so that you don't have this angst that so many have.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.320]   Thank you for listening.
