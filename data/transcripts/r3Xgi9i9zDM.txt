[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   This thing that we call happiness has at least three levels or layers that we filter it through
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.320]   when we ask ourselves, "Are we happy?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.600]   How do I be happier?"
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   This element of contrast with negative experiences seems to be a repeating theme, momenta mori
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.720]   being a negative sort of dark cloud from which we're supposed to see the light and act in
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.800]   the light.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.280]   Happiness exists in religious narratives, philosophical narratives, and scientific reality.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.000]   I can imagine three layers.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.400]   The first is sensory experience.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.320]   The reason to take a cold shower, folks, in addition to the fact that it'll save you on
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.440]   your heating bill, is that the warm shower that follows, in fact, that's how I do it,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   feels so good.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.400]   10 times better than it would if you had just gotten into the warm shower, I promise.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.480]   Same thing about getting out of the cold plunge.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.340]   There's a lot of debate about these things, but this is just pure sensory experience and
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.140]   contrast of the sort that we're talking about today.
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.720]   Hunger and then eating a delicious piece of food or eating a not so delicious piece of
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.840]   food, but you're hungry and so it's that much more delicious, okay?
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.080]   Million examples we could spiral towards.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.720]   So there's sensory experience, there's raw sensory perception and experience from which
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.080]   the contrast creates this thing that we like feel better, aka happiness sort of.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.000]   Then there's story, like, "God, last year was a tough year.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.620]   This year was better."
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.480]   There's also, and I've seen this before, like, "We were killing it for two years and then
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.080]   this year was kind of a meh year."
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.240]   This is not the case, by the way, but I'm very fortunate that the podcast has continued
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.360]   to grow and expand.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.840]   But for some people, they're not as happy with their whatever salary this year because
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.920]   even though it's spectacular by somebody else's standards, by their standard, it's down from
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.080]   previous years.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.760]   So there's the story that we create that has...
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.540]   It's not sensory experience, it's perception based on dopamine and it's perception based
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260]   on reward and punishment, etc.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.840]   And then there's this third layer, which is meaning.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.960]   Like, you said, yeah, you know, spending time with in-laws, like, okay, every moment of
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.040]   it might not be as awesome as you might like, but there's meaning in spending time with
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   people that are extended family, especially when elders and younger are in the same room.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   It's something really...
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.800]   It layers on story to create this sort of other level that we call meaning.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.920]   And so what I'm realizing is that these are three timescales.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.820]   So we have the immediate timescale of happiness, we have the kind of intermediate one where
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.420]   we introduce a story, and then we have meaning, which is kind of like this whole picture.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.520]   So it seems to me that we need to approach happiness from all three levels, that it's
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.120]   not enough to just be like a dog, which are in the sensory experience, presumably, of
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   happiness.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.660]   If they tell stories, they don't tell them to us.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.440]   And if they have meaning, I don't know.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.200]   But they seem to like nail the first level.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   So and there are probably five more.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.120]   And they probably don't have the capacity to do the other two.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.440]   So it's not like they're not doing it and kind of missing out.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.120]   They kind of have brains that don't let them notice they're missing out.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   But we unfortunately have brains that would feel like we were really missing out if we
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.080]   just had the sensory experiences, you know, without the good stories.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   I think you're pointing to this idea that sort of being happy in your life and being
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   happy with your life.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   The "with your life" part has the kind of medium timescale stories, but also the really
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   big ones, right?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   You know, is my life, am I doing anything really meaningful with my life?
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.180]   Am I finding purpose?
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.800]   And so on.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.820]   The funny thing, though, is to get to that big timescale to find a sense of purpose and
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.440]   stuff like that, sometimes it pays to do stuff at the local level, at the medium and shorter
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   term timescale.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   And one of the things researchers have found is that if you're engaging in activities at
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.320]   the short term timescales that kind of fit with your values or what these positive psychologists
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   have often called your strengths, that can be a way to sort of achieve purpose.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   So what are strengths?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.960]   So researchers do this thing where they want to look at like all the valuable things people
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.320]   can do out in the world, right?
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   And so what are the things that you value?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   And folks like Chris Peterson and colleagues have come up with this list of what they call
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   different character strengths.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   And there are things that like, you know, you can actually if you Google online character
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.280]   strengths, you'll get the big list.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.000]   Often people talk about there being 24, but they're just universally good things like
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.480]   being brave, you know, citizenship, humor, like, you know, social intelligence, love
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   of learning, right?
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.560]   You know, kind of empathy, fairness, right?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.740]   These kind of sets of values that we have.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.920]   People differ in how much they value one or the other, you know?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.720]   So I could ask you, Andrew, like, what's better, like bravery or humor?
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.240]   Probably both pretty high for you, I would imagine, but like about prudence versus love
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   of learning, I guess.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   Yeah, I mean, if I had to pick between bravery and humor, I think bravery is probably more
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   important to me.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   I see, more humor, yeah.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.880]   I mean, I love humor, but if I had to pick, it's sort of like, you know, steak and coffee,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880]   I'm going steak.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   Yeah, okay.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   Well, the point is we, there are individual differences in this and there are formal tests
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   you can do online.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.920]   If you Google the VIA character strengths test, you'll see these 24 and you can do one
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.400]   of these very systematic, you know, kind of tests to do it.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   But really just trying to think about like, what are the values that you value?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.160]   And the ones that come to mind as being particularly about you, the ones that you resonate with
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.400]   are what somebody like Chris Peterson would call your signature strengths.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.000]   They're the ones that when you execute them, you kind of feel like things are meaningful
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and purposeful and so on.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.680]   And so the idea is that one recipe for a purposeful life at the local level is trying to engage
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.800]   in behaviors that allow you to use more of these values or strengths.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.000]   And one of my favorite pieces of research that looks at both the power of this and how,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.880]   even though if it seems like that those are hard things to bring in, like you should bring
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.360]   them in more, is some work by this woman, Amy Resninsky, who's a professor at the University
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   of Pennsylvania.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.160]   And she does these studies on what she calls job crafting, which is a practice where you
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.320]   take your normal job description as whatever your job is and figure out ways that you can
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.520]   infuse your signature strengths into them.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.640]   You know, so you as a podcaster, if your signature strength was bravery, you could bring in guests
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.200]   that made me feel a little bit intimidating to you, probably like me, I imagine.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.380]   Or like you could take on topics that are a little bit harder, right, that kind of push
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.680]   you a little bit, right?
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.240]   If your signature strength was humor, you'd add more company or make more jokes.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.000]   If it was love of learning, you'd pick topics that like you didn't know anything about,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.680]   but you kind of dive in, right?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.000]   You take whatever your normal job description is and you find a way to build in your strengths.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.720]   And the reason I love Amy's work so much is that she studies signature strengths not in
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.120]   academics like us who have very flexible jobs or podcasters.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.960]   She studies signature strengths in hospital janitorial staff workers who are, you know,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.520]   these are people who are cleaning the linen in a hospital room or mopping the floors and
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.800]   stuff, not a job where you think there's lots of flexibility or you could build in things
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   like, you know, humor and love of learning and the stuff.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.960]   But she finds interestingly that like around a quarter to a third of these janitorial staff
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.600]   workers say that their job is a calling.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   They love it.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.160]   They get a lot of purpose from it.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.800]   And they're the ones that are naturally building in their signature strengths.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.040]   And she tells in her work, she tells these lovely stories.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.680]   This is a story of a janitorial staff worker who worked in a chemotherapy ward.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.240]   And if you've been unlucky enough to have cancer and had to have chemotherapy or know
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.420]   someone who did, you know that people tend to get really sick because the medicine makes
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.420]   people really nauseous.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.720]   So a big part of this guy's job was like cleaning up vomit basically.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.660]   But he said, you know, my job isn't to clean up vomit.
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.600]   My strengths are like humor and social intelligence.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.160]   And what I do is I make a joke.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.120]   This is somebody who's having a really crappy day and I'm going to do something that's going
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   to make them laugh.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   And if I do that, then I won.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   It's not my paycheck.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   And I guess he had a standard joke, which was like, oh, my God, this is a big pile of
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   vomit.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   Overtime, like for me.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   And like, you know, you're laughing.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   Listener's probably laughing.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   He's like, that's my job.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.080]   I talked to another worker who worked in a coma ward.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.800]   So this individual couldn't talk to the patients because they're in comas.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.160]   But her strength was creativity.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.840]   And so every day she like moved the artwork and the plants around, you know, just kind
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.400]   of created some changes.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.840]   And she thought maybe that would pop people out of their coma.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   I don't know if that's medically plausible.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   Probably not.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.800]   But it doesn't matter to her.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.960]   She felt like she was executing her creativity.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.800]   And so the moral of this job crafting work is no matter what your job is, there's probably
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.560]   some room to building some more purpose.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   If you take some time to think about like what are the strengths, what are the things
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   that get you going?
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.080]   If you need a tip, you can kind of Google these things.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.680]   But then how could I infuse that into my normal job description?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.520]   And there's probably a lot more flexibility than you think.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.600]   You don't need to quit your job and become a podcaster to like get this flexibility.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.480]   Whatever you do, there's some window where you can build that in.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.720]   That's awesome.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.160]   Those are awesome stories.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.120]   I also was just thinking about the janitor cleaning up the vomit, like to like restore
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.320]   some dignity to these people that clearly know they're making a mess and like, you know,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.280]   humor being the ultimate bridge.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.460]   And darn it, why'd you make me have to choose between humor and the other thing?
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.460]   Because humor is so awesome.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.460]   Sorry, now you're like, "Humor's pretty good.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   Humor's pretty good."
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.460]   Now I'm rethinking my answer.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.240]   It's very brave to clean up vomit as well, I think, right?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.720]   I mean, you bring humor to a place where, you know, some people might presume humor's
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.940]   not allowed, but goodness.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.740]   The signature strengths in the list of, you said 24 of them, where can people learn more
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.000]   about these signature strengths?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think this would be a really powerful exercise and we can always find the link and put it
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.800]   in the show note captions, but is there like a place that people can find this stuff?
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.280]   The values in action is the viacharacterstrengths.org.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.120]   So I can share the link and you can stick it in your show notes, but yeah, people can
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.040]   go on there for free and do one of these kind of, you know, formal psychometric tests where
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   you measure your strengths, see what they are.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.920]   And it's a fun website too because you get to kind of – they give you some suggestions
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.120]   because some of these, you know, values are like prudence is one of them.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.960]   It's like, "How do I exercise prudence and love?"
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.840]   You know, these are different things.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   They also make the suggestion – this is a homework assignment I give in my happiness
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.440]   class of suggesting you do this with a good friend or a romantic partner.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.400]   Have each of you do this and find strengths that you share together and then you can go
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.540]   on what researchers call a strength state where, you know, if you both have bravery,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.280]   then that means you guys should do the – I don't know, the obstacle course or do some
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   really scary hike.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.920]   If you both have humor, now you go to a comedy show.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.200]   If you both love learning, now you go to a museum or something.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   So you find the thing that's like your convergent strengths and you do something that exercises
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   them.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.040]   So that means you can use your strengths to get purpose not just in your work but in your
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   leisure too.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.760]   I think this is another spot where we get stuff wrong.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.040]   I think a lot of us have work that tends to use our strengths.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.080]   We tend to gravitate towards careers, many of us, where we can use our strengths.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.320]   A lot of folks aren't that lucky.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.040]   But in our leisure time, we don't often do that so much, right?
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.640]   Often our leisure time is like plop down, watch Netflix where a lot of folks like – if
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.960]   you think about how you can build your strengths into your leisure time, it gets even more
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   exciting.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.000]   So you're talking about working with your hands and doing all this stuff like build
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.960]   the bravery and the humor into that somehow and now you get your leisure time doing double
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:53.420]   duty for giving you a sense of purpose and meaning too.
