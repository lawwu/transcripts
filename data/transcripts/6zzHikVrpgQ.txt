[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.220]   We close out the week with another question
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.080]   on marital intimacy.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.520]   This question is even more frank than yesterday's,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.560]   so obviously it's intended for mature audiences only.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.760]   Steve, a listener, writes in with a common question
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.700]   that we get in the inbox pretty regularly, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.280]   He writes this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.220]   "In episode number 475, you talked about sexual attraction
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.500]   "and argued that it is not essential for marriage.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.300]   "I am married to a gracious woman
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.620]   "who will gladly oblige me if I ask her,
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.040]   "but I find that though I do need sex,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.020]   "I do not desire it when I know she obliges
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.820]   "without any sexual desire for me.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.300]   "If I sense she is getting no enjoyment out of the act,
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.960]   "it makes it feel utterly disgusting to me.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.680]   "What advice would you have for me?"
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.980]   My heart aches for Steve when I hear this.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.040]   I know exactly what he means,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.780]   and I think it's normal and healthy,
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.540]   maybe with the exception of when he said,
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.100]   "I feel disgust at that moment."
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.060]   I'm gonna come back to that and caution him,
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.380]   but I do agree.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.380]   God made sexual relations to be profoundly mutual.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.360]   Mutual in marriage.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.880]   Each gives, each receives, each feels the act
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.080]   as the consummation of a wider and deeper spiritual
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.280]   and personal union for which sex
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.160]   is only one of the capstones, but an important one.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   Each is saying to you and you only do I give in this way
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   and from you and from you only do I receive in this way.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.460]   There's so many levels at which the mutuality
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.100]   of sexual relations is significant.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.100]   So yes to his dismay and sadness at the lack of mutuality.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.300]   Steve's experience in one form or another, alas,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820]   is quite common.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.840]   We need to broaden it out and think about it for a moment.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   Couples seldom have the same level of interest
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   and passion about sexual relations,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.760]   and that relates to frequency, location, timing,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.880]   methods, privacy, kinds of touch.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.680]   No couple has the same comfort level
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.000]   with all these variables.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.360]   So it sounds like Steve is dealing
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   with a particularly difficult example
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.960]   of what is virtually common to every couple,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   how to live sexually when desires in all these areas
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.500]   are often significantly different,
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.240]   or at least in some of them.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.320]   So here's the key passage of Scripture
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.760]   where Paul addresses this pretty directly.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.440]   First Corinthians 7, three through five.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.440]   The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.560]   her marriage rights.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960]   That means sex.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.040]   And likewise, the wife to her husband.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.660]   For the wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.200]   but the husband does.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.520]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.920]   over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.320]   for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   but then come together again so that Satan may not tempt you
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   because of your lack of self-control.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   Now, the most obvious thing in this passage
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.760]   is that Paul commends relatively frequent sexual relations.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.340]   Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.800]   for a limited time, but then come together again
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   so that Satan may not tempt you.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   What's less obvious is that whose desires should govern
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.800]   how this act of sex happens is perplexing.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.940]   What happens if you say,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.680]   wife, accede to your husband's desires.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.340]   Husband, accede to your wife's desires,
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.320]   which is in fact what he says.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.120]   For the wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.740]   but the husband does, so he can do as he pleases.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.440]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.320]   over his own body, but the wife does,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.000]   so she can do as she pleases.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.620]   Well, so she gets to call the shots
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.880]   and he gets to call the shots.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   Now, what do you do if the shots are not the same?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.960]   I don't think Paul slipped up here.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.600]   Oops, contradicted myself.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.900]   That's not very helpful.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.680]   Paul is not that kind of person
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.000]   and he's guided by the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   I think he knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.320]   He knew that he was dealing with one of the deepest,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   most complex emotional moments in human life,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.100]   which means that any simple formula
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.720]   for who gets to do what and when and where and how,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.320]   a simple formula will not fit reality.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   The reality is that in a Christian marriage
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.980]   where the couple are growing in grace,
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.980]   they will figure this out along the lines of Romans 12.10,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.200]   outdo one another in showing honor,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   or you could say grace or mercy or love
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.520]   or kindness or gentleness or whatever.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.680]   It's the most wonderful kind of competition,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.760]   outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.480]   She will want to honor him by giving him what he desires.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.740]   And he will want to honor her
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.420]   by giving her what she desires,
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.800]   which may be less of his desire.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.880]   And they will pray and they will talk and they will struggle
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.000]   and they will grow with much frustration along the way.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.240]   So I want to give a word to Steve's wife
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.280]   and then to him, to his wife.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   Be sure to never stop growing in emotional maturity
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.000]   that can join people in their joy,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.520]   doing things you don't care about doing.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   And you can hear me generalizing here.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.760]   This isn't just sex.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.340]   This is a general growth issue in Christian life
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.680]   for all of us.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.240]   This applies especially to your husband,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.720]   and he should do the same for you.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.240]   He may want you to go fishing or golfing,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.800]   and you may want him to go to your kind of movie
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.200]   or a particular concert.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   And we all know people who say yes to those invitations,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   and then in a dozen ways,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.840]   through their body language and other ways,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.280]   show all during the event, "I don't want to be here.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.880]   I wish I weren't fishing with you.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.760]   I wish I weren't at this stupid movie
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.200]   that you wanted me to go to."
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   That is a mark of profound immaturity and shallow love.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.280]   The need is to grow up and learn to be bathed in grace
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.320]   at this moment.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.020]   And this especially applies in the marriage bed.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.360]   Don't say yes to your husband's desire tonight
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.480]   by complying and then in a half a dozen ways,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.000]   communicating, "I wish I weren't here."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.520]   This may be a revelation to you.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.500]   Let me try it.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.680]   You don't have to have the same kind of pleasure
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.440]   to make him feel loved.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.040]   Take joy, if you're not enjoying
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   the actual physical realities of touch and sexual union,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.600]   take joy in him.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.440]   Take joy in the fact that you can give him pleasure.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.720]   Take joy in the fact that he only wants it from you.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.880]   Take joy in the privilege that he trusts you
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   with his naked, emotional, physical, ridiculous abandon
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.200]   that he would be embarrassed in any other context
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.560]   to display and he trusts you with this.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   Take joy in the grace of God that you have
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.800]   and that you can give yourself to him in these situations.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   In other words, a mature, growing, gracious wife
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.680]   who does not find physical pleasure in sexual relations
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   can find lots of pleasures in the event
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   because of the way God set it up to be.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.040]   There are ways, there are ways that a mature wife
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   can delight in that sexual moment.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.960]   And just a closing word to Steve,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.000]   I would say don't assume the worst about her.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.280]   Assume that even without sexual desires,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.520]   she has other good desires to please you.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   And that is a kind of love that you can receive and enjoy.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.760]   Yes, you wish she were more passionate,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.440]   more there, more engaged.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.600]   Yes, you do, and that's normal, that's good.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   What husband wouldn't want that?
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.080]   Or wife if he's not engaged.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   But don't let your disappointment turn into a growing anger
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.200]   or a disgust, like you used that word.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.400]   Don't let your disappointment and the shortfall
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.160]   turn into a disgust that drives you farther apart.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.240]   Do your best to turn the sexual encounter
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.160]   into something she will enjoy at some level.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.080]   That may mean, that may mean it's what you say to her
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.400]   that makes all the difference.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.640]   She looks forward to those moments
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.160]   just because of your words, if not the event.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.560]   And I'll pray, I really will.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.880]   I'll pray for you, Steve, and your wife,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   that both of you will learn the secret
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.080]   of outdoing one another in showing honor
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.000]   and in showing pleasure.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.720]   Wise counsel, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.920]   And thank you for the follow-up question, Steve.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.320]   Behind this episode was episode number 475,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.960]   is sexual attraction essential for marriage?
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.360]   You can find that in the podcast archive.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.200]   And we addressed a related question yesterday
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.800]   in episode number 516.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.520]   And if you have a question for Pastor John,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.600]   we'd like to hear it.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.400]   Keep it short, keep it to the point,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.080]   and email it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.560]   We're gonna break for the weekend now,
