[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   So what do I want to do today?
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.100]   Well, last episode in episode 268, we looked at some ancient wisdom.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.680]   That we took out of Marcus Aurelius' meditations that seemed relevant to
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.520]   the modern task of trying to build a deeper life in today's deep dive.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:23.340]   I want to look at three unexpected ideas from my own writing over the last 20
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.180]   years that turned out to be surprisingly effective for helping people escape
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.840]   the shallows and moved your life somewhere deeper.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.200]   So these are ideas that are unexpected, not the traditional things you would
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.080]   hear, but over the years I've learned work really well, so we've shifted from
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.600]   ancient ideas from last video and episode to modern ideas today.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.620]   All right.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.100]   So the first idea I want to start with is something I posted
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.320]   on my website in June of 2008.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.880]   So I have this loaded up on the screen for those who are watching.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.500]   The title of this essay from June of 2008, back when I was young and baby
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.680]   faced and a doctoral student at MIT, is titled "Dangerous Ideas.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.180]   Getting Started is Overrated."
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.520]   And I start off by saying, look, attend any talk given by an entrepreneur,
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.840]   and you'll hear some variation of the following.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.580]   The most important thing you can do is get started.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.040]   A little bit later in the article, I say, but here's the problem.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.580]   I completely disagree with this common advice.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.400]   I think an instinct for getting started cripples your
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   chance at long-term success.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.380]   And I suggest that on the contrary, you should develop a rigorous
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.340]   thresholds that any pursuit must overcome before it can induce action.
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.700]   So I get into this a little bit.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.640]   Why should we be wary of getting started?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.220]   And I nod towards survivor bias, noting that, hey, people who did
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.660]   something successful then look backwards or like, well, you know, I'm glad I didn't wait.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.760]   So you should get started as well, because if you're also going to end up
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.100]   doing something as successful as me, why wait, let's just get started.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.440]   So I argue that survivor bias or survivorship bias might be one of the
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900]   reasons why we hear this advice.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.780]   But when I looked at people in real life who seem to have been done
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.920]   impressive things, here's what I noticed.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.240]   And I'm reading from my article again.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.260]   I've noticed that people who succeed in an impressive pursuit are those
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.600]   who established over time, a deep emotional conviction that they want
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.360]   to follow that pursuit and have built an exhaustive understanding of the
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.660]   relevant world, why some succeed and others don't and exactly what type
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.160]   of action is required.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.500]   This takes time.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.380]   Often it requires a long period of saturation in which the person returns
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.980]   again and again to the world, meeting people and reading about it and trying
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.620]   little experiments to get a feel for its reality, this period will be at
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.940]   least a month, it might last years.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.500]   So this is what I had noticed when I got more serious about studying success
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.800]   and impressive accomplishment.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.840]   I noticed that the key was not action.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.780]   And if anything, action seemed to get in the way, because as you launch all
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.540]   these different initiatives, not really understanding the world, not really
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.000]   with a deep conviction of this is what I I'm going to do this, this is worth
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.760]   doing those pursuits trail off.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.340]   They trickle off and they fall apart.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.420]   You do that enough times.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.020]   And what do you get out of all this frenetic motion is, well, you get the
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.900]   smoke from the friction, but no actual noticeable forward progress.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.380]   You're much more likely to get despondency than you are success because you begin to.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.320]   Author this story that says, I don't know.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.140]   I've tried a bunch of stuff.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.240]   Nothing seems to work out.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   I can't imagine myself succeeding.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.180]   Those who do really impressive things often haven't said those two other
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.440]   ingredients, they have a deep conviction that this is something that's worth
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.500]   doing and it's worth taking the time to do, and they really understand how it
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.240]   works and how people who do this actually succeed, they know the world.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.060]   They've read about the world.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.980]   They've met people in the world.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.340]   They've taken little steps in the world.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.200]   They're pretty locked in.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.420]   Okay.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.740]   I understand what's going to happen here.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.100]   You need both of those things.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.220]   If you're going to survive the ups and downs of getting really good.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.460]   And as I argued there, that takes time.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.780]   You have to really come back to something again and again.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.040]   In my own practice, I think of this as the circling period where I'm
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.940]   circling a particular pursuit.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.420]   Maybe I should be doing this.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.700]   Let me back off.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.920]   Okay.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.660]   Let me come back at it again from another angle.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.660]   Let me talk to someone else.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.560]   Let me gather some information.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.500]   Now let me wait three months.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.680]   All right.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.660]   Let me come back to it again.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.260]   And you circle and you circle learning and encountering until
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.780]   either one of two things happens.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.100]   The potential pursuit becomes inevitable and unavoidable.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.640]   And then you launch down that path with your eyes blinkered forward,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.860]   your jaw set with conviction, or your ardor begins to dissipate.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.740]   And you realize, yeah, this probably wasn't the right thing to do.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.580]   This has happened to me again and again.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.020]   It happened to me with book writing.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.460]   Happened to me with academia.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.660]   It happened to me with podcasting.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.300]   And this podcast was launched in 2020.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.980]   2020 was not the first year I had a thought about a podcast.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.860]   I've been doing podcasts at a regular rate since roughly about 2014.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.260]   I've probably been on a couple thousand different podcast episodes.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.180]   I know the field well.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.060]   I circled this for a long time until I really understood it, really
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.700]   understood why it would make sense for me, really understood what it would
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.420]   take to succeed, which direction I would have to go, and that all took time until
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.820]   finally it became inevitable.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.500]   I have to do this.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.260]   There was no real doubt when the time came by the summer of 2020.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.500]   Okay.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.420]   This is something I definitely have to do.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.060]   All of those pieces had come together.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.060]   It took a long time, but that was important because I had that
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.340]   conviction in this particular case study, because I really understood the world.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.740]   I've been interviewing podcasters.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.860]   I've known, I've seen the ups and downs up close.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.140]   I knew the numbers cold.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.020]   I was willing to put in the time required.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.700]   And this does take a lot of time.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.220]   I mean, Jesse will tell us because he's been here as well.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.300]   He's seen this stuff takes time.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.100]   And we were talking about the numbers the other day, the big initial milestone.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.780]   And we crept up to this number.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.980]   We first started signing with an ad agency.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.460]   I could get 15,000 downloads on an episode.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.340]   And that took a while.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.100]   I think it was a whole year before we signed with an ad agency.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.420]   So we could, we could do a two episodes a week and maybe
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.980]   get up to 30,000 downloads.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.540]   Um, we're now pitching 65,000 downloads.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.100]   That took a long time.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.980]   It took a long time to get to 15.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.300]   It took a lot longer to get from 15 to 65.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.020]   It doesn't jump.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.900]   And in fact, it comes back down again.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.820]   Jesse always hears me complain about our downloads graphs because to me and
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.940]   Jesse, you'll, you'll admit this is true, whatever scale I look at these graphs,
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.140]   no matter when I look at these graphs, it looks like our downloads are going down.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.620]   I'm always like, I was like, our downloads are going down.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.980]   And yet when we zoom out, they're up.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.660]   And I don't know when this up is happening, but my point is that it's hard.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.300]   And if it wasn't locked in, I'm willing to spend five years, five years to make
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.420]   this thing that something really big and impressive, if I wasn't willing to do
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.940]   that, it probably wasn't going to happen.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.700]   And that's why it took five years for me to decide to pull the trigger.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.780]   All right.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.660]   So that was my first piece of contrarian advice was be
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.740]   careful about getting started.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.540]   Here's the issue though.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.900]   Of course, won't this lead to procrastination?
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.660]   Maybe you will never get started.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.740]   And I do want to acknowledge that this is an issue.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.700]   Fear of success, perfectionism, procrastination becomes a much
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.460]   heightened issue if you say, I really have to be sure before I get going.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.700]   And I think a lot of people have faced that issue, but my argument is the right
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.780]   solution to that issue is not just get started on everything right away, because
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.460]   that's going to be just as unsuccessful.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.460]   The place where we should be focusing, if we care about the psychology of action,
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.300]   the place we want to be focusing is on how to walk that tightrope, not getting
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.340]   started too early and yet at the same time, not avoiding starting altogether.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.140]   That's a very difficult psychological tightrope to walk successfully, but it's
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.700]   hard and there's no way to avoid that.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.940]   That's what we should be focusing on.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.860]   That's the challenge.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.060]   And we can't get rid of that challenge by saying, don't try.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.740]   And we can't get rid of that challenge by saying, just start right away.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.140]   Neither of those is going to work.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.340]   We can't avoid that psychological complexity.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.220]   This stuff is hard.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.180]   It's hard work.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.780]   You shouldn't start right away, but you should start eventually,
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.180]   but maybe not on this thing.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.500]   And how do you know when it's the right time?
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.140]   You don't really, you just learn and you think, and you build that conviction.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.980]   And it's complicated and it's difficult and we should just admit that, but just
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.700]   getting started on everything, uh, it's not going to get you there.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.220]   There's a famous guy.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.740]   Kaiya sock.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.820]   Do you remember this book, Jesse guy, Kawasaki book, the art of the start.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.700]   No, I never read it.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.300]   It's a good title.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.980]   But I think, uh, at some point I wrote a book or a post call, like the art of not
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.020]   getting started or something like that, because I don't know.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.460]   Um, that was definitely in the, definitely in the air at the time.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.020]   All right, let's do another unexpected idea that proved in surprisingly effective
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.260]   in helping people cultivate depth.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.100]   This idea I'm going to, I wrote about this.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:09.180]   I believe I ended up writing about this in deep work, but this is where this idea
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.580]   first emerged because this post is now from 2010, July, 2010.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.420]   So two years after the getting started post also in the summer, maybe the
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.820]   summer is when I have my best ideas.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:26.620]   The title of this article from 2010, treat your mind as you would a private garden.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.140]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.340]   I just wanted to mention.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.300]   If you want to have help taking action on the type of ideas we talk about in this
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   show, sign up for my email newsletter.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.620]   The link is right here below in the description, two to four times a month.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.780]   I send out detailed articles about the types of ideas we discuss here.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.060]   It's the best way to stay connected to me and my audience's
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.300]   quest to live a deeper life.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.100]   So sign up below.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   Well, this is interesting.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.380]   Where did this notion come from?
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.580]   Uh, it's not mine.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.300]   It comes from a book that I read around this time that was influential to me.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.620]   And that was Winifred Gallagher's 2009 ode to focus wrapped.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.020]   R a P T.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.460]   Now here's the thing about this book Gallagher who does fantastic science
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.860]   writing begins her book talking about her own cancer diagnosis to quote her here.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:26.220]   Not just cancer, but a particularly nasty, fairly advanced kind.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.900]   Now I'm going to read from my post here for a second.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.500]   She realizes that this disease wants to claim her attention and that this was no
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.740]   way to live with what may be the last moments of her life.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.180]   So she launches an experiment to reclaim her attention, relentlessly redirecting
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.020]   it towards the things that matter most.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.780]   Quote big ones like family and friends, spiritual life and work and smaller ones
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.460]   like movies, walks, and a 6 30 PM martini.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.380]   Gallagher comes away from the experiment with a good prognosis for a disease and a
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.100]   visceral appreciation of a surprising fact.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.660]   Quote, life is the sum total of what you focus on.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:07.660]   Yet most people expend little effort cultivating this focus.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.940]   She goes on to suggest that you should treat your mind like
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.140]   you would a private garden.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.460]   Carefully tending what you allow to grow in there and
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.980]   keeping out things you don't want.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.980]   This idea was very influential to me, and I think it is more relevant today to our
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.460]   culture writ large than it was back in 2010 when I was first writing this article.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.980]   Let's start with why this idea is important.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:37.780]   There's a, almost a epistemological philosophical truth embedded in here
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.260]   where Gallagher is saying there is not just an objective world out there that
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.020]   you are observing and, and noticing things about.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.540]   It's not, here's the world and either you're seeing it or you're not.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.340]   Your experience of the world is constructed inside your mind.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.580]   It's based off of in general, the types of things that you are paying attention to.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.740]   Right.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.300]   It's just like if you are the victim of a crime, let's say you're
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.860]   mugged on the subway for a while.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.580]   Your view of the world is when you go on the subway again, is very much going to be
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.620]   one of, of anxiety and tension and fear and seeing everyone around you as someone
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.460]   who's like potentially going to cause trouble because it's the same people that
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.060]   you might've seen the day before you got mugged, but the way in what you pay
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.660]   attention to can really change the way you experience your world.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.700]   And Gallagher saying writ large, this is true that even with all this terrible,
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.100]   objectively terrible stuff happening in her life with a cancer diagnosis, by
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.980]   focusing relentlessly on stuff that was good and important, it made her happy,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.060]   made the world she was in seem much better, even though these bad
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.900]   things were happening in it.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.180]   What you pay attention to really affects your subjective experience of life.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.900]   So why is this very relevant today?
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.660]   More so than it was even when Gallagher's book came out
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.580]   because of phones and social media.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:13:00.180]   So now we are seeing this effect significantly amplified because of our
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.300]   phones and social media, because of the engagement cues of algorithmic curation
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.020]   and the push towards trying to attract attention as long as possible on these
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:15.620]   devices, you can really be thrown into a world that is constructed algorithmically.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.620]   Every five or six minutes, you're checking your phone and seeing news and social
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.020]   media posts and newsletters that are coming from this engagement ecosystem
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.380]   that can incredibly color your experience of the world.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.940]   Think about people, you know, who are very online.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.820]   They tend, for example, to be very cataclysmic.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:42.420]   They think the world is, you know, a day or two away from a major civil war.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.660]   And really the only thing that's going to get in the way is before that can even
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.380]   happen, there's going to be a climate apocalypse that's going to fuel an even
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.540]   worse strain of COVID that turned people into zombies that are going to steal
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.940]   election results as a way to try to keep certain books out of the libraries or
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.460]   something, right?
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.340]   I mean, if you're online all the time, you're like, my God, the world is falling
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.180]   apart. It's what you pay attention to.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.580]   Colors your experience of everything in the world.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.500]   Anything you see, innocent conversation you're having with a parent at your kid's
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.540]   school, a play, everything suddenly is colored by this.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.300]   We should treat our minds like a private garden and say, I don't want to see the
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:28.780]   world as being a few days away from, you know, the, the civil war climate pandemic
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.380]   apocalypse, and we're all about the die.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:36.620]   I like Winifred Gallagher, enjoy my six 30 martini friends going to see the movies.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.020]   So this is something I think that has proven to be really effective as care,
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.260]   what you pay attention to, how much news you read, when do you read it?
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.020]   Why do you read it?
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.260]   What engagement sites you allow yourself to turn your attention towards?
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.780]   How much of your time and attention do you want Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk to
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.380]   monetize?
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.860]   I mean, at what goals you say?
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.380]   I think they have enough money.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.340]   I have better things to do than to be involved with that.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:07.380]   Why are you watching sort of YouTube videos of people crashing into things when
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.420]   you could be reading a book like Winifred Gallagher's book or reading a classic,
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.100]   trying to like put yourself into the mindset of a great thinker from times past
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.860]   to push yourself instead of again, watching though they're entertaining, you know,
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.740]   videos of people falling in the fountains because they're reading their phone.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.860]   I mean, what if you were going back and watching great films and reading
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.100]   secondary sources on them?
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.860]   So you're prepared.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.940]   Let me try to pull this apart.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.220]   Understand why this movie is good.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.380]   There's so much stuff you could be paying attention to that points out the good in
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.140]   the world that gives you appreciation for quality that makes the world seem like a
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.020]   place where the miraculous can happen and people are divine.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.780]   And there's really interesting things are always around each corner.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.820]   What you pay attention to matters for how you think about your world.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.660]   And never have we had to think about that more than in an age in which there are
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.740]   plenty of companies that can reach us through that little piece of glowing glass
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.820]   in our hand and control every ounce of what we focus on.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.420]   So we need an independence from that.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.700]   We need to treat our minds like a private garden.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.420]   The effect can be phenomenal.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.940]   You say it all the time too, with like books and how long they take to curate
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.100]   those ideas and how long it takes them to write it as opposed to a post or
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.820]   something that may have taken somebody a few hours.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.140]   Well, even a post is old fashioned.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.100]   A tweet.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.660]   A tweet.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:29.180]   Or a comment on a tweet that you then obsessively check to see if that got
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.780]   engagement.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.020]   I mean, here's the thing about a book as someone who's written eight of them now,
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.260]   you spend a long time thinking about those ideas and a lot of people work on
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.340]   them with you and like, are you saying this just right?
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.660]   And that's not even a great sentence.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.540]   And let's go back and rethink the order of it.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.820]   By the time you get to the book, you're seeing a sort of crystallized form of
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.980]   human thinking push to a level of consideration that you're not going to see
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.500]   online.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.820]   So even that can just give you hope for the complexity of human thinking.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.620]   All right.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.300]   One more idea.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.220]   Third idea.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.860]   This is from 2014.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.020]   So we're marching forward.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.140]   We started in 2008 with the 2010, we're up to 2014.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.380]   This is September.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.300]   So it's not the summer.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300]   So we'll break that trend.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.020]   Now the title of this, of this article doesn't give a lot away.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.260]   It's called, should you work like Maya Angelo or Eric Schmidt?
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.500]   But the, the quote I want to use for the title of this idea is the following and
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.620]   is buried in this article.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.420]   Think like an artist, but work like an accountant.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.020]   All right.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.900]   So this came from a David Brooks column that I had read back in 2014.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.180]   And as I say here, uh, in the top of this article, I wrote about Brooks's column.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.860]   Ultimately Brooks's column was about geopolitics, but he began it by riffing
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.100]   on Mason Curry's book, daily rituals, which really was a phenomenon.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.780]   I've quoted that book quite a lot in a lot of my own work.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.220]   And this was a book where Curry went through the lives of famous creatives,
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.500]   scoured their memoirs and biographies and letters, and just point extracted
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.060]   everything he could find about their rituals for work.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.220]   So people love this book.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.220]   And so Brooks was just looking for an excuse to write about it.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.780]   Now, however, what was cool about his summary was a couple of points he made.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.260]   So let me, let me read from my article, which will in turn quote Brooks.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:24.780]   To summarize these observations, Brooks quotes Henry Miller, quote, I know that
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.540]   to sustain these true moments of insight, one has to be highly disciplined,
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.420]   lead a disciplined life.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.780]   He then offers his own more bluntly accurate summary, quote, great creative
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:42.660]   minds think like artists, but work like accountants or to put it in study
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.340]   hacks, lingo, deep insight requires a disciplined commitment to deep work.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.660]   So what was I getting at here?
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.100]   An idea that I think has pervaded my thinking about what we do here on this
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.220]   podcast and in my writing in the years since, which is there is a paradox at the
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.020]   core of organizational productivity, right?
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.060]   So that's the term I'm going to use here for productivity that is focused on
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   organizing the obligations in your life so that you have more intentional
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.660]   control over how you spend your time.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.540]   I'm trying to separate this from outcome-based productivity, which has
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.620]   more to do with maximizing output per each unit of input.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.900]   Right?
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.820]   So for organizational productivity, there's this paradoxical observation.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:30.220]   That the better you are at that, the more free, creative and relaxed you can be.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.780]   And this goes contrary to a lot of people's instincts.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.900]   People think, wait a second to be organized is in some sense
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.820]   where creativity goes to die.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.140]   I'm going to have my planners and my systems and it's so rigid and there's
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.820]   no room for me to be creative.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.540]   There's no room for me to just go on a flight of fancy and the following idea
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.940]   or to go into the field with my fields note notebook and have that big insight.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.220]   If I structure my life, I'm going to be a boring executive.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.540]   I'm a creative type.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.700]   I don't do that, but what Brooks is pointing out here, his lesson
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.740]   from studying Mason Curry, his lesson that he quoted Henry Miller making
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.740]   is that actually this organization supports creativity, relaxation, and freedom.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.540]   To have your arms around, here's the things on my plate.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.580]   Here's what needs to be done.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.460]   Here's when I'm going to do things on them.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   Here's what I need to take off because this is too much.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.660]   That gives you the breathing room needed to relax.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:33.060]   That gives you the breathing room needed to be creative because when you can trust,
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.580]   okay, I have things captured.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.220]   One of the things you can do is like, great, I'm going to spend all day today,
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.620]   just working on this creative pursuit.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.140]   And you can do so without distraction or guilt because you're not just.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.540]   Randomly pushing stuff to the side and hoping nothing bad happens when you can
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.220]   control your times and obligations.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.740]   You can realize with precision, the impact of everything you've said yes to.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.340]   And have the courage to pull back.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.300]   When you realize exactly what happens with your time and how long things take,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.420]   you're much more realistic when you say yes and no.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.900]   You say, no, no, no.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.780]   I know how this story ends.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.420]   If I say yes to this, this, and this, that's going to put this many things on my schedule.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.700]   I've seen that before because I have a pretty good sense of my time.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.620]   That's going to be too crowded.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.300]   I know I need to pull that way back.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.420]   I need to stop doing this.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.780]   No longer do these gigs, leave this position, rechange this.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:21.500]   It gives you this type of autonomy over how your time actually unfolds.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.060]   So I like the way Brooks put it, think like an artist, but work like an accountant.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.540]   So when you're thinking, be creative, be deep, be free, but when structuring your
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.620]   work, be much more structured, like an accountant, and you'll be able then to
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.420]   get more out of your time.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:45.660]   If you do things like a multi-scale planning, you have a quarterly, weekly,
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.660]   daily plan, time block plan makes a big difference combined with full capture.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.100]   When you're making a plan for your time, as opposed to reacting, when you have
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.780]   sequentiality, when you have heuristics and quotas for how much, when you say yes
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.940]   and how much work of each type you let on, when you're able to see clearly how long
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.860]   things took and then go back and make decisions about what to do going forward.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.540]   All of this actually frees up more creativity and more relaxation.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.460]   It leads you to the possibility of a freer life.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.300]   And if you really want to significantly simplify your life, there's really no
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.540]   better way to start on that path than to get control over everything.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.740]   So that like a surgeon, you can start incising and scapling off all sorts of
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.060]   different things that have the biggest footprints and make sure the things that
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.500]   remain get done at the highest level.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.300]   That's an unexpected idea, but it's one that has proven unexpectedly, I think,
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.900]   effective in thinking about living a deeper life.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.180]   Think like an artist, but work like an accountant.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.180]   So obviously there's a lot of more classic ideas I talk a lot about on the
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.020]   show, but I thought it'd be cool again, to go back and look at the other
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.060]   ones that seemed to hold the test of time.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.500]   So let's just summarize all three.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.620]   Getting started is overrated.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.900]   Treat your mind like a private garden.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.860]   Think like an artist, but work like an accountant.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.780]   All of these are a decade old or more, but I think they hold up.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.860]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.060]   That's old flame throwing Cal and his blogging days, just
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.580]   throwing ideas out there.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.300]   That book, um, that Brooks reference sounds pretty cool.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.060]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.580]   Mason Curry, the daily rituals.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.340]   That book was a phenomenon.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.700]   It was so cool.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.300]   It was just, here's a lot of famous creative minds from history.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.140]   Here's how they work.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.220]   And just went through it.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.700]   Everyone was writing about that at the time.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.980]   I talked about it in digital minimalism.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.740]   I think I cite some stuff from it in slow productivity as well.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.380]   Mason Curry was a cool idea for a book.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.780]   It was actually a blog, like everything was back then.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.300]   It was a blog that he turned into a book.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.100]   Um, really cool project.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.700]   All right.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.380]   So I want to move on and do some questions roughly on these, this
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.060]   general topic of sort of escaping the mediocre life and finding depth.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.860]   Before we do, I want to mention real quick, a sponsor that
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.300]   helps make this show possible.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.420]   And that is our friends at Mosh.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.460]   No, I got to tell you this.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.740]   So, so, so, uh, Mosh bars come in six delicious flavors.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.380]   Let's give you the, I'm gonna give you the foundation of
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.780]   right, tell you a story for my life about these Mosh bars come in six
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.460]   delicious flavors, each has 12 grams of protein and are made with
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.900]   ingredients that support brain health.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:24.420]   Like ashwagandha, lion's mane and collagen and omega threes at 160
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.660]   calories, only one gram of sugar.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.460]   Mosh protein bars are a guilt-free snack.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.700]   Your brain and body will crave.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.060]   I can tell you from experience, uh, they will.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.220]   It was just a few days ago that I got a whole box of these.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.380]   That box is empty.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.740]   Because they taste really good.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.340]   They've got a great texture where it's soft, but with
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.740]   crunchiness inside of them.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.980]   They barely have any sugar in them.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.260]   We're talking one gram of sugar.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.420]   They have a lot of protein.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.740]   So when you just need, I'm a little, I'm having a hard long day.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.700]   Thing after thing after thing, you just want a little bit of energy input.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.900]   They taste great.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   And they're going to get that to you guilt-free.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   So I just ate the whole box.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.620]   It's a whole box.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.940]   I love the flavors, interesting flavors.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.340]   We're talking banana bread.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:07.980]   That's very good.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   Chocolate, peanut butter.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.500]   I mean, come on, you're not going to go wrong.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.660]   And so like, clearly I'm a mosh, I'm a mosh bar fan.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.820]   You can just tell by looking at the rate at which I actually, uh, empty these boxes.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.820]   Uh, mosh was actually founded by Patrick Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.700]   It's a mission driven brain health and wellness company that donates a portion
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.380]   of all proteins to support women's brain research through the women's Alzheimer's
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.660]   movement at the Cleveland clinic.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.300]   It also has a new line of plant based protein bars.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.020]   And three delicious flavors for those who want all the protein and brain
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.100]   support in the original bar, but now made with plant based ingredients.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.020]   So don't settle for a mediocre snack.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.580]   When you can nourish your body and mind with the fuel it needs to succeed.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.900]   So whether you're at the gym on the go or just living your best life, mosh
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.940]   protein bars will keep your brain and body fit, field, and feeling good.

[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.420]   Speaking about health, hard to find a doctor these days.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.820]   How do you do it?
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.020]   You ask people for recommendations, you know, people like, I don't know.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.060]   How about this guy?
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.700]   You go there, they have no appointments.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   They're not going to be able to get you a prescription.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.060]   You go there, they have no appointments.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.860]   You ask someone else, they're like, I don't know this.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.780]   She's pretty good.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.700]   You go there, they have an appointment, but then it turns out they don't take
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.540]   your insurance and you just wasted your time.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.100]   It really is quite primitive how we find healthcare providers.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.460]   That's why you need ZocDoc.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.540]   ZocDoc is a free app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.180]   online, we're talking about booking appointments with thousands of top rated
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.860]   patient review doctors and specialists.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.500]   And you can filter specifically for ones who take your insurance and are located
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.660]   near you and treat almost any condition that you are searching for.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.580]   It just makes sense, right?
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.580]   I need a doctor, pull out the ZocDoc app, go to ZocDoc.com to get it.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.860]   Let me search near here.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.500]   I need this type of specialty, takes this insurance, has appointments, boom.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.900]   Here's a list.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.140]   Let me read the reviews.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.780]   Hey, people really like this one.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.100]   That seems good.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.860]   Here they say, look, he does pretty good treatments, but also has a tendency
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.340]   towards spontaneous cannibalism.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.420]   So be careful about him.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.580]   So maybe you don't go with him.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.540]   All the information's right there.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.820]   You avoid spontaneous cannibalism.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.980]   You get the good doctor.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.580]   You don't have to find, find out they don't take your insurance.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.820]   It just makes sense.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.340]   And once you find the doc you want, you can book them
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.780]   immediately with just a few taps.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.220]   No more waiting awkwardly on hold with a receptionist.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.100]   So anyways, go ahead.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.620]   Sorry.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.660]   I was thinking, I was thinking Jesse about speaking of cannibalism.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.540]   Sure.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.420]   ZocDoc loves this.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.180]   One of my kids was going on a field trip today.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.340]   He does not get my sense of humor.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.580]   Going on a field trip today to a skyline caverns, the caves.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.340]   Okay.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.380]   And I told him, cause I thought this was good advice.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.140]   So I said, look, if you notice something, uh, something seems to miss, like the,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.860]   the, your tour guide looks nervous.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.220]   Like he might be lost or like some of the lights are going off.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.180]   Your best bet is to start cannibalizing someone right away.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.820]   So like you keep your nutrients up, you know, you can get to like probably the
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.060]   person, it just, just get right to the cannibalizing right away before, you
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.260]   know, uh, there's competition or whatever.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.020]   And he thought about it for a second and was like, dad, I think it's unlikely
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.220]   we're going to get lost in the cave.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:47.260]   So I guess you could probably say the same about if you're worried about your,
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:52.700]   uh, about your doctor, um, being a cannibal.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.140]   ZocDoc will help you avoid that.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.700]   All right.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.460]   Forget cannibalism, good doctors, take your insurance nearby reviews.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.380]   ZocDoc will get you there.

[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.100]   All right, Jess, let's do some questions.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.340]   That kind of got me reminded of a side rant that Mad Dog had last week about,
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.940]   uh, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.340]   Were they, is Taylor Swift involved in a cannibal scandal with
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.700]   Taylor, with a football player?
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.380]   There's just like, there's just this big rant that he went on that was
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.140]   hilarious and it kind of reminded me of the same.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.940]   Speaking of Mad Dog, I was listening to Bill Simmons being interviewed
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.300]   on the Smart List podcast.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.380]   They were talking about why he got in the podcasting and he said his
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.140]   biggest influence was Mike and the Mad Dog.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.740]   Oh yeah.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.460]   They were big.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.300]   They were real big.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.900]   And he's, um, where's Bill Simmons based?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.380]   Has he been in Connecticut?
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.180]   He, I mean, he was from Boston.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.620]   Okay.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.820]   Then he moved to Connecticut after his parents got divorced in high school.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.300]   Okay.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.220]   And now he's, um, based in LA.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:04.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.940]   But he said what he liked about Mike and the Mad Dog was when they would veer
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.020]   from sports to talk about like culture issues.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.300]   They'd have authors on stuff.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.460]   So that still does.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.980]   And that's where Bill Simmons, you know, really adopted this idea, which is his
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.660]   of bringing pop culture and intersecting that with sports.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.180]   So it's not just pure sports.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.180]   It's the pop culture stuff is just as important.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.860]   So there you go.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.500]   A dog.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.060]   All right.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.580]   First question is from Tanya.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   I'm struggling to be social and confident.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.900]   What can I do to speak more articulately and gain confidence
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.300]   and impress more people?
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   Well, Tanya, it's a good question.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.540]   And I can tell you a lot of this is practice, right?
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.980]   The more you're around people in different situations, the more
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.820]   comfortable you get in those situations.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.300]   The more you spend talking about things or explaining yourself or talking to people,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.540]   the more comfortable and articulate you get in those types of conversations.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:03.340]   I mean, I talk pretty, you know, here on this podcast, but in part, because
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.900]   I've been professionally speaking since I was in my young twenties.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.220]   So I'm sort of used to it.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.260]   The cadences of speaking, the pacing, the coming up in your head with
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.020]   what you're going to say next.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.860]   It all just sort of comes with practice.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.460]   So social stuff really can be practiced.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.300]   You can start with very low key social stuff early on stuff that you're
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.580]   already pretty comfortable with.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.540]   I know this person, I don't mind hanging out with them.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   So we go to a restaurant or a bar together or go to a movies
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.020]   together on a fairly regular basis.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.420]   I'm just used to in a comfortable situation, being out in the world with
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.220]   people and talking to them and interacting, but the stakes are low.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.340]   Then you can build that up to bigger things.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:39.620]   Okay.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.620]   I'm going to go to bigger social events or parties at first, you know, small ones.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.220]   Here's my friend, that's their birthday party.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.700]   And you get more confident with that.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.300]   So a lot of this is just practice.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.660]   Now, one of the things I think that is often left out of this
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.380]   conversation is the role of anxiety.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.820]   Anxiety gets really intertwined with socializing in ways that I think it's
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.620]   hard for people who don't feel that same anxiety to understand, they don't
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:11.180]   understand how these really get mixed in together, you really can start to build
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.940]   up a sort of dread or anxiety around different situations.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:19.300]   It's why one of the outcomes of pretty severe anxiety disorders would be an
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.180]   agoraphobia where you don't leave your house anymore.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.740]   It's because often those two things can go together.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.460]   The same circuits that are related to sociality are often the same circuits
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.300]   that are short circuiting when you're suffering from anxiety.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.780]   So if anxiety is a real issue here, Tanya, it's not just, Oh, I'm out of practice.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.260]   What do I do?
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.140]   It's I really feel physically dread and concern and panic
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.340]   when I'm in these situations.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.940]   I would look towards ACT, ACT-based techniques.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.420]   They're very good for exactly this situation.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.180]   So ACT, otherwise known as third wave psychotherapy, stands for
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.700]   acceptance, commitment therapy.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   It's a very effective evidence-based type of psychotherapy that does really
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.740]   well with anxiety, social anxiety, panic type anxiety around other people.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:14.500]   It's really based upon separating feelings from your actual actions.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.940]   It really helps train you to recognize the physical symptoms of something like
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.820]   anxiety and say, yes, but I'm still going to commit to do this thing that I think
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.700]   is valuable, and I can still do that even if this feeling comes and goes.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.900]   It helps you avoid labeling that feeling as this is really important.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.220]   Something really bad is happening.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.740]   It's really bad to be feeling this way.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.980]   It breaks that loop of you labeling your feelings and just seeing them as
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.220]   feelings themselves.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.180]   We talked about this a little bit in last week's episode.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.780]   We read Marcus Aurelius' meditation.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.140]   He had some actually stoic ideas that are connected to modern
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.900]   acceptance, commitment therapy.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.740]   But I just want to point that out there, Tanya, that there is a more serious
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.420]   training you can do with the tools of ACT that are there and available.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.820]   And so if the anxiety is really holding you back, that's not permanent.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.220]   You have to think about that like knee pain.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.540]   You had knee pain.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.780]   The doctor's going to help you fix it.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.740]   Though it might take some PT and a little bit of time.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.020]   Same thing here.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.260]   Look into acceptance, commitment therapy.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.340]   There's some good books on it.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.660]   I think it's the Happiness Trap is one of the famous sort of public
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.780]   facing books on ACT.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.220]   That's a good entry place into it.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.700]   Harris, Russ Harris, maybe.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.140]   Well, you can look that up, Jesse.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.220]   It's the Happiness Trap.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.540]   But I just want to throw that out there because it can be frustrating
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.460]   if you're on the anxiety spectrum.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.420]   I'm on that spectrum.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.220]   It manifests for myself in interesting ways.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.500]   I have to do a lot of training on it.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.500]   Depending if you're on that spectrum, it can be frustrating
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.060]   to just be around someone really social.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.420]   It's like, what's the problem?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.340]   Just like come to the thing, like what could go on?
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.340]   And they don't realize that you're feeling a minced red.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.420]   So there's a lot of things you can do there, Tonya, the train.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.340]   Do the work. It is worth it.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.700]   Sociality is very important.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.540]   Yeah, you got it right.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.740]   It was Russ Harris.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.700]   Russ Harris. OK, the Happiness Trap.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   Yeah. Yeah, it's a good book.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.420]   All right, what we got next?
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.460]   Next question is from Ben.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.500]   In what ways can being ordinary be good in life?
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.100]   This was an interesting question, Ben, I had to think about it a little bit.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.020]   It resonated a little bit because I think what you're getting at here
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.060]   is this interesting trade off when you're thinking about the deep life
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.380]   and how you want to shape it.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.660]   There's one way you can go, of course, is towards exceptionalness.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.180]   I want to do something exceptional.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.660]   I want to be noted for it.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.740]   I want to do something noteworthy, have some fame for this thing
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.060]   that I'm doing that's important.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.060]   That's one particular path for the deep life.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.100]   The other path for the deep life is I want to build a life around my values,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.660]   you know, start with discipline, figure out my values, organize my stuff,
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.380]   sacrifice and be a leader on behalf of others and then find areas of my life
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.340]   to be remarkable.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.660]   And you could sort of have this quiet, deep life
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.700]   where you really matter to a lot of people and you find and extract out of life
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.540]   a lot of joy and appreciation of stuff that's fantastic or great or remarkable,
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.220]   all without having to be I am an exceptional X and people recognize it.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.060]   You have sort of two paths towards depth here.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.420]   That's kind of pros and cons of each,
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.100]   especially when we look at that exceptionality path, right,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.740]   because there's good there and we shouldn't turn down the good.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.900]   Why do people want to try to be great at things?
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.940]   Well, first of all, you do gain more autonomy.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.260]   Right, you do something really well, there's more demand for it,
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.740]   you often gain more financial reward and or more control
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.540]   over how you live your life.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.620]   There are several things I do at a pretty high level,
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.380]   and I do have a lot of flexibility in my life.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.300]   We get to mess around in this playhouse, deep work HQ.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.060]   You know, I go away in the summers.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.100]   I have very high control over my schedule.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.340]   I don't worry about money, really. That's not really an issue.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.420]   So there's like great autonomy that comes from doing some things really well.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.260]   Also, it feels good to be respected in the moment.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.220]   We're wired for that.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.500]   This is the whole tribal leadership thing.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.860]   We tell ourselves it doesn't matter, but there is ego.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.780]   And it's and you do feel if something goes really well,
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.060]   you'll feel good about that for a while.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.780]   There's a reason why people chase it.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.340]   That is the stimulus that is perverted when we see workaholism. Right.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.180]   So with a addiction, there's usually some sort of very powerful
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.780]   stimulus that becomes the driver for the addiction,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.140]   the feeling of intoxication, right?
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.420]   Workaholism is really that feeling of, wow, I did this thing well.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.540]   And and people recognize that.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.620]   And my boss rewarded me.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.700]   That's a very strong stimulus.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.340]   That's why you could build a whole addiction around it.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.980]   On the flip side, though, it can be very stressful and anxiety producing
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.100]   to try to do something exceptionally well, it's hard to do,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.340]   and it puts you in a bigger, more stressful circumstances.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.380]   You have to navigate.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.860]   You get more people perhaps who like want your time
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.060]   than you have nearly enough time to actually give.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.540]   And you have to start saying no to people.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.740]   And people think that you're being, you know, snobby or elitist.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.340]   High stake things are just anxiety producing.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.860]   And you have to figure, is this worth the anxiety, is this one not?
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.940]   Things can fall apart.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.380]   It's hard to do things at a high level.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.820]   So there's negatives that come with it.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.780]   I mean, I constantly have to make these decisions.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.540]   There's things I, you know, television, things I've turned down, for example,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.300]   that may be an isolation, you say, well, that's cool.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.100]   Like I know that show.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.260]   That would be really cool to go on.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.340]   And it's like I can't do all of these things.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.820]   And if I did, it's going to overwhelm me with time constraints.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.020]   The anxiety have to be careful about how I make my path.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.900]   So it's tricky.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.300]   So I think it's a really good question, Ben,
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.100]   if you're going the route of let me just be exceptional,
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.380]   you can build depth around that.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.180]   And there are some real positives you're going to get, but there's also negatives.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.540]   And I say that because I think that then when you get the scale between
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.220]   the quiet, remarkability approach
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.740]   versus the exceptional, notable, famous remarkability approach,
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.940]   when you put the cons with the pros on this ladder, the scales become about balance.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.300]   And so you really, if you're going the quiet, remarkability approach, a life that,
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:59.060]   you know, it's. Lorelei Gilmore and the Gilmore Girls,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.500]   not famous outside of Stars Hollow,
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.420]   not like exceptional at anything, but in that world,
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.980]   you know, is really well known and has built this really interesting life
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.540]   and people really know her and appreciate her and she's involved in people's lives
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.140]   and is having a positive impact on that town.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.740]   But she's not famous outside of that small little town.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.100]   That's quiet, remarkability, not so bad of a path.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.780]   And again, I don't want to say the other path,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.460]   the sort of exceptional remarkability is bad.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.900]   I'm just saying when you have the pros and the cons, it's no longer like,
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.020]   well, this is clearly better if you have the skill, you know, you have the whatever.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.300]   I can shoot a really good jump shot. I could go that way.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.180]   If you have the possibility to go that way, it's not bad,
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.300]   but it's also not a no brainer.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.220]   And if you don't see an obvious way to get to the exceptional remarkability,
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.060]   you shouldn't feel bad about it, because again, these things balance out.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:51.220]   Steph Curry versus Lorelei Gilmore, that old famous comparison like there's
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.460]   there's I don't know, there's plus and minuses to both.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.940]   So neither should be dismissive of the other.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.580]   That's a weird I might be the first person in history
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   to make that particular comparison, probably.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.180]   I mean, I can't imagine it's come up in the locker room.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.340]   The NBA finals, Steph, man, this is your it's your Lorelei moment, buddy.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   This is it. You got to just get out there.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.740]   I want you to man up and Lorelei this. All right.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.380]   I mean, you got to your dribbling should be like the fast speech
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.860]   cadence of Lorelei Gilmore confusing people with as you move back and forth
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.660]   verbally through various things.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.060]   And this is the Kirk of your town.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.060]   But you need to get the ball to Luke.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.300]   I just probably some basketball strategy metaphor.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.700]   The end of that speech would be like, hold on one second.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.660]   Someone's hand me a piece of paper and oh, yeah, I'm fired.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.860]   And then the coach just walks out.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.620]   And so that story ends like, yeah, it makes sense.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.620]   And I was fired. All right. Nonsense. Stop the nonsense.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.180]   Let's move on. What do we got next?
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   All right. Great. Next question is from Samantha.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   How important are having friends in life?
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.820]   If it is important, how would you recommend an introvert go about finding some?
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.820]   Also, can you provide some advice on moving on from certain friendships
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.220]   that could be holding someone back?
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.780]   So it's a good compliment to Tanya's questions
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.780]   about being more social and confident friends, as I mentioned,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.580]   there are critically important.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.060]   And for a friendship to be real, it has to involve non-trivial sacrifice
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.140]   of time and attention.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.620]   Otherwise, your brain doesn't treat it as real.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.420]   So just texting someone all the time doesn't count.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.900]   Commenting on the social media doesn't count.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.620]   Being active in a WhatsApp channel with them also does not count.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.260]   As far as your brain is concerned, they're not a friend
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.540]   until you're going places and doing things with them, doing things
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.340]   you might not otherwise want to do, but you're doing it because they're your friend.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.740]   That's when your brain begins to take the relationship seriously.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   So this should be a regular part of your weekly planning,
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.620]   especially if you're trying to build up friendships as something
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   that's more important than a regular part of your weekly planning should be.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.540]   What am I doing this week to strengthen or develop friendships?
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.020]   You have to be pretty systematic about it.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.500]   Especially if you're sort of getting back in the saddle, so to speak.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.780]   So fortunately, I can point you towards a resource here.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.780]   There was a segment we did a few episodes back
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.220]   on this notion of the friendship recession, this idea that Americans
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.260]   in particular have less friends than ever before.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.420]   The segment where I had my friend Jamie Kilsing come on and talk about
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.660]   what he went through to gain a new group of friends in his 40s
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.380]   as a male, where this is kind of difficult.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.580]   So we got into the weeds in that episode about specific things
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.980]   you can do to actually find and cultivate friends.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.580]   So I won't repeat that all, but I will say find that segment
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.020]   on the friendship recession.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.100]   That was a final segment on a relatively recent episode.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.460]   Maybe Jamie, you can look or Jesse.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.420]   Yeah, Jesse knows whenever Jamie's on, I begin just furiously messing up their names
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.420]   because and as Jesse has pointed out, is maybe it's because
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.580]   Joe Rogan's podcast producer is named Jamie.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.980]   So it's just in the collective conscious of like Jamie is what you call
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   the other person on a microphone when you're podcasting.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.020]   So it doesn't take much to tip me into that.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.260]   He'll look that up.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.020]   But anyways, I think it was 266, 266.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.140]   Take control of your technology habits.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.420]   Right. Episode 266, deep life dot com slash listen.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.620]   You'll find that in the video for it's there as well.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.740]   So look at that discussion with Jamie, because I think this is critically important,
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.340]   especially if you do not have a robust group of friends.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.140]   Think about that like getting in shape.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.820]   It's going to require a lot of work on a regular basis with some tried
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.860]   and true tactics, but it is absolutely, absolutely worth doing.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.700]   All right, Jesse, see, I almost had Jamie there.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.700]   I'm telling you, it's like very difficult once you start thinking about that.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.420]   Jesse, what is our next question?
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.340]   All right, next question is from Evelyn.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.540]   I had been a high school teacher for over a decade
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.340]   and then moved into a non classroom role, still in education.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.780]   Now, a couple of years in, I can confidently say it makes me miserable.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.780]   The work environment suffers from all the symptoms you describe
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.340]   about knowledge, work and from lack of management.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.380]   Ultimately, I decided to return back to the classroom, taking a pay cut.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.580]   But I wanted to radically shift, radically shift how I approached the job.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.300]   I'm curious if you have any advice for re-approaching this type of work
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.380]   in a way that guards against burnout and prioritizes craft,
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.380]   deep work and slow productivity.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.100]   Well, Evelyn, first of all, I like your intention here.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.020]   You're trying to actually craft your life to match the vision,
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.940]   your vision of your ideal lifestyle.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.540]   Let me briefly mention the pay cut piece as well,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.540]   because I think this is something that often leads people astray.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:43.140]   People often do a style of budgeting with their income
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.220]   where they just think about any reduction in that income
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.180]   is having stuff taken away from them.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.620]   When you're doing lifestyle centric career planning,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.060]   you got to go the other way and you have to do zero based budgeting,
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.780]   which is implicitly what Evelyn is doing here.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.620]   What are the things that are important for us to live our life
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.660]   in the way we want to live it?
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.900]   How much of those costs? Good. That's how much money we need.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.540]   And so if this pay cut for Evelyn still keeps them able to, you know,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.300]   we can live where we want to live and do these things and not have undue stress,
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.340]   then they're golden.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.700]   The money becomes just one of the other tools you have to craft your ideal lifestyle.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.260]   It doesn't become the primary metric by which you measure
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   the success of your lifestyle.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.500]   So this is a critical point to make for those who are cultivating a deep life.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.940]   Money has to become a tool.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.900]   It could no longer become the object.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.580]   And this opens up this type of flexibility.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.100]   Evelyn did not like her job.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.060]   And so this job might be better for me.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.300]   I have to lose the money. Who cares?
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   I don't see this losing money.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.340]   I see what is the configuration of my life in this new job?
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.700]   Do we have enough money to afford what we need?
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.260]   Yes. What else matters about this job?
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.620]   And you see the money as one part among others.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.500]   That's a nice little tidbit hidden in this bigger question.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.700]   All right, let's get into the details, though.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.940]   Evelyn is saying now I'm returning to the classroom.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.460]   How do I keep this deep?
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.140]   How do I keep slow productivity at play here?
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.660]   How do I avoid burnout in the classroom?
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.260]   I have a few things to recommend just based off the many teachers
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.580]   I've spoken with over the years and my own experience as a academic teacher myself.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.740]   But first of all, organization systems really matter when fighting off burnout.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.460]   Multiscale planning control over your time matters.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.060]   If you are semester weekly, then daily time block planning,
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.900]   you're making use of the full 40 hours you have every week.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.820]   And when you're making use of the full 40 hours, you can avoid the pile ups.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.900]   You can avoid the oh, my God, I got to work late tonight
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.100]   because I have to prepare for parent teacher conferences and get all these tests
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.460]   graded and all this has to happen by tomorrow.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.700]   That's the the scheduled deadline.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:52.220]   Collision long work hour days is a real source of fuel for burnout.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.940]   Multiscale planning helps you avoid that because now you see, oh, I'm going to start
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.460]   working on the parent teacher conferencing a week early in this Tuesday.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.940]   This block, I'm going to finish it and the test prep can start this day.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.580]   You see the time you have and you can move the proverbial chess pieces around there
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.860]   much easier, so you have to care more about organizational productivity.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:16.180]   Second, tailor your curriculum more to minimize.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.740]   Negative impact of my curriculum here, I don't mean the content,
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.940]   I mean the way in which you deliver and assess material.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.340]   Do we have the students do quizzes every single day?
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.820]   Do they bring things home and I check them and then they go back
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.540]   and they work on them?
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:34.220]   Anything involved in how you actually deliver the content
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.660]   so that the logistical curriculum look at this, among other things,
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.220]   through the lens of what's going to make my life easier.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.300]   And what you do here.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.140]   What you do here is you keep the floor being, well, what's first of all,
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.300]   what's going to work well for the students, but within the realm of the equivalence
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.820]   class of many different ways that you could actually implement
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.100]   the details of your class.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.500]   If you lean towards the things
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.420]   that are going to make your life easier versus harder,
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.500]   there is no difference to the students or the parents.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.100]   They don't know.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.740]   But for your life, it can make a difference.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.900]   This is a real endemic issue with junior professors.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.300]   They come into planning their class and really don't want to think about.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.940]   Easiness for themselves, what's going to be tractable or not, like, no, no, no.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.780]   It's all has to be about what I do, I think is best.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.260]   And so we're going to do these interactive exams every single day,
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.300]   and then they're going to comment on the class blog
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.260]   and I'm going to come in and comment on their comments.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.540]   And then we'll have a scribe and the scribe is going to take notes
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.180]   each week on the comments, on the comments,
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.820]   and then the scribe is going to give it to me to review so we can post it.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.220]   But I'm going to do a video wrap where I go to I go to give the best highlights
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.300]   there, but I got to film each one on a different high point
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.540]   from a different U.S. state because there's a metaphor there.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.060]   You have all these ideas like I just got to do the best ideas
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.940]   and your life is incredibly difficult.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.060]   Or actually, the students would get the same pedagogical effect if it was
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.540]   we have these problems that's posted on the board when you come in
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.620]   and you do each of these reaction problems for the first 10 minutes.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.580]   And there's an hour every day on Friday where you go through them
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.220]   and use check plus grading because you don't want to get into the weeds.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.860]   And and it solves the problem, but it's much easier for you.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.100]   I learned this the hard way as a teaching assistant at MIT.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.660]   Oh, my God, the details of how I run this class makes a huge difference
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.620]   on my life and the students could care less.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.820]   They don't know the difference between this or this or that.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.340]   But for me, it can make a big difference.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.540]   So I think teachers don't do that enough.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.500]   They don't consider the impact on their own time and schedule enough.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.180]   But if anything, it is negligent as a teacher
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:34.940]   to design things that overwhelms you because your time and attention,
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.820]   you only have a limited supply.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.540]   And it's sort of part of your responsibility to make better use of that.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.460]   So care about how you tailor the logistics of your curriculum.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.260]   Communication systems matter, especially with parents.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.820]   And one of my kids has a teacher, for example, that runs parent office hours,
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.940]   which is such a good idea.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.380]   These two hours on this day, you can always just call me.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.580]   Any question about your kid or what's going on, just call me.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.620]   I'll tell you about it.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.700]   You know how much back and forth email that solves?
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.340]   The parents don't care. They just want clarity.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.420]   Oh, my God, I worry about this thing with my kid.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.940]   What do I do about it? Oh, Tuesday. Great.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.100]   I'll call them then. Parents just want clarity.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.300]   But by having that good system, this teacher has
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.740]   this context switching footprint has been reduced.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.620]   And then finally, I've heard this from a lot of teachers,
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.140]   especially at like the secondary level.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.420]   Be very wary about the extras.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.780]   Be very wary, especially at first, to say yes to things
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.580]   that you don't necessarily have to, hey, will you help run this thing
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.340]   at the school or do this extra initiative or be the assistant advisor
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.740]   for this new club? Just be really wary about that.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.860]   Like those things have a huge cost
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.220]   and you want to be really wary about making those costs.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.820]   You might even at first feel like I'm not really taking on new things
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.820]   for the whole first year.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.220]   I'm getting the lay of the land here.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.860]   And then I got to choose something I really want to put my energy into extra.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.340]   OK, the theater production.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.260]   And that's kind of my thing.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.860]   And I don't I don't do other things.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.060]   And I'm not particularly apologetic about it.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.740]   And the people who ask me, I say, no, just move on to the next person
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:01.500]   to ask right away.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.940]   I'm not trying to become, I don't know, the teacher rep
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.140]   to the union or the principal.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.300]   I'm just trying to do my job.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.820]   Don't be apologetic about it.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.300]   All of those ideas, by the way, could adjust to many different
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.420]   knowledge worker jobs.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.620]   Being organized, tailoring how you design
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.740]   the work you do to minimize the footprint.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.620]   Being careful about your communication systems
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.740]   and being wary about taking on extras.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.900]   I think that applies to almost any knowledge worker job
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.180]   and can really help reduce overload.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:33.100]   If I'm going to summarize these ideas, I'd use the term slow productivity
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.340]   like my new book, Man on Mars.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.020]   This is a slow productivity mindset.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.180]   All right, let's do one more quick question here.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:39.980]   Jesse.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.980]   All right, next question is from Samir.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.460]   I like the idea of a deep life, and I've replaced passive Internet
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.900]   use with activities that I really care about, such as mathematics, botany
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.140]   and playing guitar.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:55.300]   My problem is that I discovered these hobbies, and he's actually in med school,
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.500]   his medical pursuit through YouTube.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.460]   I follow Andrew Humor and other math channels.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.340]   Is it OK to still use YouTube to get innovative ideas?
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.500]   Always a good chance to review my thoughts on YouTube
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.940]   because it's a complicated platform.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:14.540]   Video and independent produced video, I do strongly believe,
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.340]   is the future of independent content.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:20.740]   For whatever reason, video has a stronger hold over the human psyche
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.220]   than either audio or text.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.780]   And yet it can also be a source of major distraction
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.260]   because of recommendation rabbit holes.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.140]   So my advice is always YouTube is fine if you use it in the right ways.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.660]   And I say you should use it like a television and a library.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.260]   What I mean about that, I see, use it like a television.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.940]   I mean, there's particular shows you like.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.020]   That you might turn on on the TV to watch Seinfeld's on tonight.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:45.700]   I want to watch it.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.020]   That's fine to use YouTube that way.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.180]   Andrew Huberman could be your Seinfeld.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.500]   I like Andrew Huberman.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.980]   It's very high quality content.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.900]   It's interesting.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.780]   It's better than anything I watch on cable.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.020]   He posts the video on, I don't know when he does it,
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.860]   but let's just say for the sake of example, on Monday.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:04.340]   So to load up the YouTube app on your TV on Monday night
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.700]   and say, I'm going to watch Huberman
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.540]   or I'm going to watch him as I eat lunch on Tuesdays
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.180]   is an absolutely fine use of YouTube.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.460]   It's like a television where you have very niche channels
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.620]   that have shows on that you really like.
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.740]   Use it like a library is also fine.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.220]   I have this hobby now, botany, like you mentioned,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.420]   and I want to look up how to take care
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.740]   of a particular type of orchid.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.300]   Look up a video of that on YouTube.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.260]   Could be a fantastic way to learn how to do it.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.340]   Visual is better than text.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.300]   There's a lot of great how-to stuff on YouTube.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.340]   Use it like a library.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.180]   What you don't want to do is use it
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.900]   as a default source of distraction.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.300]   So you don't want to use it as I'm bored.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.140]   Let me go to YouTube to be entertained.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.780]   That's where the danger is.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.380]   You start following these weird videos
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.620]   until eventually it's like someone in a weird costume
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.180]   opening a box as they fall into a fountain
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.580]   that gets full of money from Mr. Beast or something.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.260]   I don't know, things get weird
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.260]   when you go down the just maximizing engagement rabbit hole.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.900]   So use it to watch particular things you like.
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.380]   Maybe you like my show, you like Huberman's show, great.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.860]   Think of it like you're watching a show on CNN or NBC.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.140]   It's just an internet delivery channel, fine.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.500]   Looking up stuff, how do I do this, how do I do that?
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.340]   Use YouTube, fine.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.700]   Just don't use it as a default source of distraction.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.580]   That's not so hard if it's on your TV,
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.020]   if you're using the app on your TV,
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.540]   because there you're just searching for a particular thing.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.580]   The recommendations, what's next is not as,
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.900]   that UI is not as powerful on TV.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.140]   If you're using it on your computer to look something up,
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.740]   just get one of those common plugins
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.580]   that can wipe the recommendations off the side.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.620]   So you can look something up in the search bar,
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.260]   click on something to watch, and that's all you see.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.020]   You don't see those rabbit hole recommendations.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.020]   Do that and YouTube can actually be a plus to your life
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.500]   and not a negative.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.140]   So it's this weird thing that could go either way,
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.540]   depending on how you use it.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.020]   TV and a library.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.900]   All right, well, we got a final segment we wanna get to.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.340]   I wanna read some of my own readers' reactions to my ideas.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.900]   First, however, I wanna mention another sponsor
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.980]   that makes this show possible.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.900]   That is our friends at Hinson Shaving.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:11.460]   Hinson makes this beautiful precision-milled aluminum razor.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   Hinson's other business, the other thing they do
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.900]   is they make precise parts for the aerospace industry.
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:21.540]   So they have these mills that can exactly mill metal
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.780]   to exactly precise precision.
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.020]   So you get this beautiful piece
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.380]   of precisely milled aluminum.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.860]   And because it's so precise, you can put a 50 cent, 10 cent,
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.300]   whatever these costs are cheap,
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.460]   little safety blade in there, screw it in.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.220]   And it has just the width of a human hair,
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.660]   edge of the blade extend beyond the edge of the razor body,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.900]   which gives you a very stable platform to shave.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.100]   There's no diving board effects with nicks and cuts,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.260]   and you get a very smooth shave from a cheap blade
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.180]   using this beautifully manufactured razor.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.300]   That's a true story.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.220]   I don't wanna speak ill of other competitors.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.580]   I won't use particular names, Jesse, but this is true.
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.860]   I was traveling recently, had disposable with me.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   I don't even know if it was a disposable.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.140]   I think it was from a subscription service.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   I don't know, but it's a plastic
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.980]   with 70 different blades in it.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   And because I threw it in the bag to travel
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.100]   because my Hinson's on this beautiful stand
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.980]   in my bathroom or whatever, nicked me right off the bat.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.940]   Nicked me.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.540]   - Just before you're about to go on stage?
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.300]   - Basically, it wasn't, but might as well have been.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.620]   - Yeah. - Nicked me.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.580]   Not gonna have that with the Hinson
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.780]   because it's precisely milled.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.620]   So you have no diving board effect, no nicks.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.260]   Anyways, I love really well-made technology
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.220]   that's durable and you can just use it forever.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.180]   And it's just a much more, I don't know,
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.460]   reasonable way to engage with tools.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.820]   And so what'll happen with the Hinson
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.780]   is you pay more upfront for the beautiful razor,
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.620]   but because you're using these 10 cent blades,
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.140]   it does not take long before the upkeep cost of this thing
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.940]   is so much cheaper than a subscription service,
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.100]   so much cheaper than going to the drugstore
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.460]   to get the disposable razors.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.100]   It's just a nice, beautifully crafted way
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.300]   to get a good shave.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.780]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.700]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.940]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.140]   and use code CAL and you will get two years' worth
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.900]   of blades for free with your razor.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.500]   Just make sure you add them to the cart,
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.460]   the two-year supply, and then when you enter the code CAL
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.140]   later, the price will drop to zero.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:22.140]   That's 100 free blades when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:29.460]   and use the code CAL.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:34.140]   I also wanna talk about our friends at My Body Tutor,
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.740]   run by Adam Gilbert, who I've known forever.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.060]   Used to be the fitness advice guy on my study hacks blog.
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.740]   His company, My Body Tutor, is a 100% online coaching program
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.620]   that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.420]   which is lack of consistency.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:51.580]   The way this works is that you're matched up
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.860]   with an online coach who helps you come up with a plan.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.780]   Here's what we're doing with your nutrition.
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.580]   Here's what you're doing with your physical activity
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.180]   and training, and then you check in with this coach online
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.820]   every single day.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.900]   Here's what I ate, here's my exercise,
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.820]   here's what's going well, here's what's not going well.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.860]   There's a problem, they say, great, let's rethink this.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.700]   Let's change this.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.660]   Oh, you're going on a trip.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.340]   Here's what you're gonna do in the hotel.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.300]   So you have someone following you every day,
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.540]   every step of the way.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.420]   Now, because it's done online,
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.180]   you're communicating through the internet and not in person,
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.060]   you're getting this trainer experience
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.540]   without the expense of having a sort of live-in,
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.420]   Hemsworth becoming Thor-style personal trainer,
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.860]   but you can get that same benefit
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   but using the efficiencies of the internet
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:37.740]   to do it more affordable.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.140]   It's just a fantastic idea.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.100]   My Body Tutor's been around forever.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.620]   It's been going like gangbusters because it just works.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.340]   I've got a coach, they help me and I can afford it.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.180]   So I'm a big believer.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.340]   You're trying to turn around your health,
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.900]   trying to turn around your health and fitness.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.540]   Don't just go out doing things randomly.
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.380]   Sign up for My Body Tutor.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.900]   When you do mention deep questions,
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.580]   and they will give you $50 off your first month.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.660]   So you just say, hey, I heard about this on Cal's podcast,
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.660]   and Adam and his team over there will give you $50 off.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.020]   Just go to mybodytutor.com.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.700]   That's mybodytutor, T-U-T-O-R.com,
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.580]   and mention deep questions to get $50 off.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.300]   All right, we're on our way now to the final segment.
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.020]   I wanna try something kind of new.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.780]   I call it Readers React.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.820]   So I'm gonna load up on my screen here
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.260]   a recent essay I wrote for my newsletter,
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.220]   which you can sign up for at calnewport.com.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.980]   You can also read all my essays at calnewport.com.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.260]   Just click on the essays link.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:40.300]   So on September 29th, I published a short essay
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:44.260]   called "On Tire Pressure and Productivity."
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:50.060]   It was based off of a small but important event
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.820]   or encounter that I had with my car.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.060]   So earlier that day,
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   I had these low tire pressure warning lights on in my car,
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.420]   and I knew my tires weren't flat,
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   'cause I checked them out.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.980]   It was probably a cold snap.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.220]   You know, you lose pressure somehow, the air compresses.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.060]   I don't know how that works,
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.460]   but this happens as the fall goes on.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.660]   Your pressure drops down, you get that indicator light on.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.620]   And it stresses me out because, you know,
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.580]   when I see that low pressure indicator,
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.540]   I now start imagining every time I turn
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.100]   that the car is slipping and sliding
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.340]   and that I'm losing whatever traction on the road.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.700]   So I don't like it.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.540]   And I was late.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.660]   I was going to see a movie.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.060]   I went to see "The Creator" actually.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.140]   AI dystopian movie.
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.660]   I have thoughts.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.180]   Mixed review, but a story for another day.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.540]   By the way, I was going to a movie
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.860]   in the middle of the day because I told my wife,
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.300]   I write about AI sometimes.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.140]   So I have to go see this movie 'cause it's about AI.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.940]   I don't know if she bought it or not, but.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.980]   - But you do that normally, like,
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.260]   it's preemptible time to see movies,
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.220]   like, throughout the month, right?
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.060]   - I try to, yeah.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.900]   I mean, usually at home.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.380]   It's more rare for me to actually,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.900]   usually for me to go see a movie
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.220]   at a theater during the day.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.020]   Usually December I'll do that.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.180]   So after the semester ends,
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.500]   but while my kids are still in school.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.620]   And then in May I'll do that as well.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.580]   When the semester ends,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.820]   but like my kids are still in school.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.660]   I'll always pick a day at the end of each semester.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.940]   I'll go buy a book and then go, go see a movie.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.780]   But I digress.
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.460]   The point of the story is, I was like,
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.500]   you know what, I'm just going to do this.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.820]   And I got out my tire pump and I pumped up the tires.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.260]   And one of them was pretty low.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.460]   Dry off to see the movie and the indicator light goes off.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.300]   And I noticed, like,
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.420]   I felt this really non-trivial sense of accomplishment.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.580]   This thing was broken and I did something physical
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.740]   and this thing here went away.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.540]   And I'm, it's better.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.500]   And I felt good.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.260]   And I told that story to emphasize a fact that we forget,
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.180]   but I think it's important,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.220]   that we are wired to get non-trivial satisfaction
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.980]   out of setting a plan for something,
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.300]   doing physical activity,
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.700]   making our intentions manifest concretely in the world,
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.460]   to quote Matthew Crawford,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.580]   and to then see the result,
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.180]   we get satisfaction out of that.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.220]   Well, this is known, right?
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.860]   This is the planning execution loop
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.060]   in the human psychology.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.900]   We know about this.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.180]   It's probably part of the drive
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.580]   that humans have to be more innovative.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.540]   A lot of animals don't have this drive.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.460]   A cat is perfectly happy, as I always say,
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.020]   to lay in the sun until hunger makes it get up
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.180]   to go get some food.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.260]   But humans get antsy because we get that high out of,
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.580]   you know what, I'm gonna change this rock into a hand ax.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.940]   And I can use that hand ax to actually
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.420]   cure this caribou hide.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.100]   Why would we bother doing that?
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.540]   What's the drive is we feel good when we do that.
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.780]   So we do have this drive towards actual accomplishment.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.740]   So I was talking about slow productivity
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.900]   in this post a little bit and saying,
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.420]   you know, it's complicated.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.900]   Productivity is complicated.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.700]   So I'm gonna read here briefly.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.940]   Let's go back here.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.020]   Okay.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.260]   "I've been thinking a lot recently
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.580]   about how both the promises and perils of productivity.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.660]   It's easy to dismiss interest in this topic
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.540]   as pure artifice propped up by an exploitative hustle culture
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.540]   orchestrated by the logics of late stage capitalism.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.060]   Such sentiments, of course, are not entirely unwarranted
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.980]   as there are subtle but urgent truths
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.460]   buried within these general analytical broadsides.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.220]   But my experience with my tire pressure
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.100]   complicates the discussion.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.820]   Our brains find deep satisfaction in seeing a problem,
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:15.100]   devising a plan, then witnessing its successful completion.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.180]   We're wired, in other words, to enjoy getting things done,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.140]   to flee this impulse is to alienate ourselves
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.060]   from our basic nature."
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.420]   So where does this leave us?
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.740]   The right question regarding productivity
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.700]   is not whether it's good or bad,
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.700]   as it's both a reflection of our humanity
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.820]   and a target for exploitation.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.900]   The better query is how we can more fully reclaim it.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.180]   All right, let's see what the readers thought.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.220]   There's a couple comments down here.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.540]   All right, so Carl,
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.780]   in the comment I have up on the screen here,
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.660]   quotes where I said, "We're wired, in other words,
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.240]   to get things done."
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.500]   And he said, "I also am addicted to functioning
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.640]   and getting things done.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.060]   But while I don't believe in the need to flee this impulse,
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.780]   I'm not so sure that this is our basic nature.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.700]   Perhaps we're only hypnotized into believing this."
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.880]   I think there's a similar sentiment below.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.740]   Close that, sign up.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.820]   I'm already signed up for this, Ease Mail.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.700]   There's a response here from Adrian to Carl
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.620]   that says, "We have a tendency to rationalize
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.260]   anything we do and usually do it subconsciously.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.240]   And the claim that this would be our basic nature
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.480]   may very well be one such attempt."
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.520]   I got revolt here.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.740]   Brian says, "You raise a good point
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.140]   about what is basic to our nature.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.020]   I would argue, however, that Carl would likely respond
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.980]   in two ways, just based on his podcast.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.220]   First, the notion of doing things is certainly drawn
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.900]   from a much richer philosophical account of agency,
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.100]   one that can be found in the work
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.260]   of the philosopher, motorcycle mechanic, Matt Crawford."
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.660]   Ooh, Brian knows me well.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.380]   I just quoted Matt Crawford.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.180]   "Doing things puts us into a relationship with the world,
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.000]   not our own making,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.940]   and that we should submit to as what'sness."
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.020]   Let me skip here a little bit.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.860]   "Second, there's the question posed by Joseph Piper
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.740]   in his book, 'Leisure and the Basis of Culture.'
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.900]   And the question is this,
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.380]   what will we do when all else is done?
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.860]   What happens when there's nothing left to do?
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.680]   Then what?
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.220]   Certainly Aristotle's notion of completion
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.460]   plays a significant role in Carl's response."
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.520]   All right, so what do we get here?
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.340]   We have two readers who right off the bat
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.380]   are suspicious of the idea
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.340]   that we have a sort of instinctual wiring
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.220]   to find satisfaction in accomplishment.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.660]   And then we had a third reader come in and say,
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.500]   "I don't know.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.140]   I think this point actually has some merit.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.180]   It's complicated,
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.940]   but the whole discussion of agency and purpose
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.340]   requires or involves somehow actually doing things,
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.000]   and this is a bigger discussion."
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.340]   All right, that's interesting.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.220]   I think it's interesting, the skepticism,
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.480]   because I do encounter it quite a bit.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.080]   And so here's the real question.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.800]   What is the actual thing
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.740]   that's being constructed from discourse?
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.380]   It's one or two things here.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.140]   Is it the idea that there's something natural
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.740]   in a attraction to productivity?
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.380]   Is that just entirely artifice?
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.260]   Or is it the idea that
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.220]   productivity is completely non-natural
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.180]   and that anything that is productivity is artifice?
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.460]   Right, there's two ideas here,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.900]   that the drive to do things
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.600]   is entirely constructed by discourses and is fake.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   And then there's something else that says,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.500]   "No, no, there's something real to this
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.660]   that just can get us out of control
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.580]   if we're not careful about it."
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.900]   So we kind of have these two,
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.860]   the readers are pointing out
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.700]   we have these two different alternative interpretations.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.500]   I'm still leaning towards the first.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.740]   And the reason why is because this idea that,
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.780]   no, I think the critical theory approach
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.120]   and the sort of classical, like new school,
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.820]   early 20th century critical theory approach
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.460]   that says any drive towards productivity
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.620]   is really just part of a sort of superstructure
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:40.380]   meant to help reinforce the exploitative logics
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.860]   of capitalism, that's a really new idea.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.580]   And a lot of ideas that came through
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.000]   this sort of brainiac post-Marxism,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.820]   brainiac extension of Marxism,
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.420]   a lot of these ideas are very smart and intricate
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.580]   and a lot of them don't work.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.460]   Whereas this other notion,
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.540]   man, there's some satisfaction in doing something hard,
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.460]   seeing it done.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.180]   This has been with the human experience
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.940]   for a really long time.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.300]   And it's been with the human experience
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.460]   well before we had sort of the
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.020]   modern industrialized capitalism.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.380]   I mean, we see it, God, in the book of Genesis.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.640]   We see it in the way farmers think about things.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.940]   We see it in the transcendentalist writing,
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.060]   the 19th century and rural Concord.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.660]   I mean, this idea really seems to pervade
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.340]   the whole human experience.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.620]   If I lean towards, there's probably something there.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.620]   Also, I think the evolutionary story is strong.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.280]   I mean, humans do need a drive towards
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.460]   having their complex ideas made
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.020]   manifest concretely in the world.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.020]   Otherwise, we don't take advantage of our brain.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.180]   We build all sorts of things
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.220]   and invent all sorts of things.
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.380]   Something has to drive that.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.780]   Other animals don't do that.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.700]   Whales have big brains,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.740]   but they don't build complex mechanisms.
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.060]   So there's gotta be some sort of drive there.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.820]   So there is an interesting evolutionary story there as well.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.420]   And it just matches our experience.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.460]   I don't know.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.220]   I don't know that I've been tricked
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.980]   into thinking the tire pressure indicator
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.940]   going off was good.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.900]   It just feels that way.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.160]   Why is it on campouts?
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.740]   Okay, here's another piece of evidence.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.620]   Getting the fire to work.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.180]   Why is that like the most satisfying thing
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.300]   you can ever do in your life?
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.560]   Is it because like that's gonna help Exxon Mobil
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.400]   or something?
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.820]   No, because it's like this primitive,
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.740]   we made fire where there wasn't fire before.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.620]   We're wired for it.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.580]   That doesn't let us off the hook though, of course.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.780]   So if I'm right about this,
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.220]   it does not let us off the hook
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.020]   because we have many examples of base human instincts
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.500]   that in the modern world get completely corrupted.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.780]   Like we don't doubt that hunger is real.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.260]   That's not a artifice of cultural construction.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:37.780]   We get hungry because our body needs food
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.500]   that can also be exploited and make us very unhealthy
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.940]   to help benefit other people.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.580]   Same thing can happen, of course,
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.380]   with this drive for, I like the fire to be started.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.420]   Hey, I made the fire happen, yay.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.660]   An employer can completely exploit that
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.820]   to try to create a culture that gets you working
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.960]   double the time your salary really says
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.900]   you should have to work.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.540]   And say, it's your passion, you should just do it.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.140]   There's all sorts of opportunities here for exploitation,
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.740]   but we don't need the drive to accomplishment
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.340]   to be entirely artifice for us to be wary of
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.320]   and point out the exploitation of an instinct.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.380]   I think if anything, recognizing that
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.700]   there's a deep human instinct here
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.820]   makes us more wary about how we think
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.500]   about work and production.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.780]   Knowing that we're playing with a fundamental human instinct
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.300]   means we're playing with fire.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:26.840]   You can do much more damage with fundamental human instincts
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.400]   than you can with stuff you have to construct from scratch.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.780]   Why do you think the attention economy
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.620]   is delivered through our phones is so successful?
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.380]   Well, in part because boredom
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.940]   is an incredibly strong instinct.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.180]   We don't like it.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.900]   And the promise of we can get rid of boredom right away
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:44.900]   is in part why META is worth $800 billion in its market cap.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.320]   That's really valuable.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.680]   So I think these comments are great.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.180]   There is a cool debate here.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.720]   And I'm still falling on one side of this debate,
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.760]   but I like that my readers are also sticking up
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.160]   for the other side of the debate.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.800]   This is the type of conversations
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.160]   we should be having about productivity.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.860]   What are the instincts at play here?
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.760]   What is construction?
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.600]   What is biological?
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.100]   How is the biological being exploited?
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.120]   I think the more complex view of this we have,
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.240]   the better, we've ignored this too long.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.820]   We've simplified productivity too long.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.820]   So I'll keep writing and talking about it.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.820]   I hope you, my readers and listeners keep arguing about it.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.240]   And we have a ongoing good debate.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.080]   I always say, Jesse,
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.980]   I've got the smartest readers on the internet.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.820]   - Yeah, baby.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.940]   - I love the comments on my blog.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.940]   We got a little world here.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.220]   It's not huge.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.100]   We don't got the trolls.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.900]   We don't got the weirdos.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.760]   We don't got the yes posters.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.340]   It's people that have been with me for a long time.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.940]   We got the smartest commenters on the internet
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.340]   over here at calnewport.com.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.240]   So. - That was cool
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.460]   how you responded to their comments.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.560]   - But I recognize these names too.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.720]   They comment a lot.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   So it's cool.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.480]   So I'm glad to be able to throw that in there.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.160]   Hey, if you just listened to this podcast
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.680]   and you wanna be a part of that discussion,
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.040]   calnewport.com, you can sign up
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.240]   to get these essays sent to your inbox.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.140]   What a lot of people do, like these commenters here,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.500]   here's what I've learned.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.320]   They wait till they get the essay in their inbox
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.720]   and then they click over to the website
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.040]   to see the comments.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.660]   And I know this because when we switched email providers
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:07.760]   a couple of years ago,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.980]   the format of the messages changed
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.480]   and it had the title of the essay at the top.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.980]   But in the old email provider,
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.140]   that title was linked to the blog post.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.700]   And in the new one, it was not automatically linked.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.220]   And I heard it from a lot of readers.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.380]   'Cause they said, no, no, no, I love the comments.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.320]   So after I read your essays in my inbox,
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.180]   I wanna go to your website to see what people are saying.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.020]   Where's the link?
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.840]   Where's the link?
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.820]   So we had to change it.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.260]   And figure out how to change the templates
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.300]   that the title was linked.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.380]   And by the way, how we changed the template,
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   quote unquote, is I just do it manually.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.940]   Because it was that important.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.120]   People wanted to see the comments.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.700]   So you can sign up there at calnewber.com
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.700]   and become a part of this conversation.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.160]   All right, well, that's all the time we have.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.360]   Thank you for listening.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.420]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.260]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.340]   Hey, so if you liked this discussion today
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:01.280]   about some modern ideas to cure your mediocre life,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.140]   then I think you'll also like episode 268,
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.540]   in which we look at some ancient ideas
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.620]   taken from Stoicism to help you accomplish the same goal.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.460]   I want to go through the ideas
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.100]   from this classic Stoic treatise
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.540]   and point out those that I think
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.980]   are most relevant to our goal here.
