[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.400]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.560]   My name is Joshua, and today is Tuesday, July 16, 2024.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.960]   News over the last few days has been saturated with coverage of the assassination attempt
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and with good reason.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.640]   I'm extremely grateful that the sniper who attempted to shoot him in the head missed
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.240]   and only succeeded in shooting him in the ear, because things could have and would have
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.600]   changed very quickly in the United States had the sniper's bullet succeeded.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400]   After any kind of event like this, I always ask, what can I learn?
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600]   What would I like to learn from the situation at hand?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600]   And there's certainly a lot to say.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.000]   I have a significant level of frustration with Mr. Trump.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.520]   I'm a politically homeless guy who really gets very frustrated by any discussion of
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.960]   politics these days.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.360]   But I like to learn from a situation.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.880]   And yesterday, I recorded a podcast related to the event, decided to scrap it, wasn't
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.920]   happy with it.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.320]   And I thought, today, let me give another crack at it.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.480]   And what I want to talk with you today about are some of the things that I admire about
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.120]   Donald Trump, specifically as to how he has continued his career into his elderly years.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   And I think there's some lessons there that you and I can learn from.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.320]   And I want to use him as a very public example of some things to which I aspire, and I think
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.280]   that you should aspire, while also pointing out some of the things that I think are potentially
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   problematic.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   First, just a couple of quick thoughts on the shooting itself.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920]   I am enormously grateful that the shooter bullet missed.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880]   Seems entirely providential to me that he did miss.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.360]   But I'm grateful that Mr. Trump is still alive.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.640]   I'm honestly surprised that this kind of thing doesn't happen more frequently, especially
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.920]   in the United States.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.160]   The United States is an extremely violent country, an extremely violent culture.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.440]   We Americans, we were birthed in violence, and we have engaged in violence at every turn
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.720]   of our history.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.120]   And yet, over the last 40 years or so, there's been not too much political violence.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   Obviously, the last attempted shooting was of President Reagan when he was shot while
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.720]   he was in office.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.040]   So that was another shooting of a president.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.560]   But the time before the 1980s, I mean, the United States was just rocked with thousands
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.880]   of bombing attempts all across the country and huge amounts of political violence.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.440]   And if you go back into the annals of history before that, political violence for unions
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.160]   and political parties has just been a constant theme in American history.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   And yet, over the last several decades, there hasn't been all that much political violence,
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.360]   a significant uptick a few years ago.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.200]   But on the whole, not very much.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.080]   And honestly, it's surprising because the tools of violence are generally pretty readily
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   available to Americans.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:48.320]   The strangest thing about the shooting was, number one, how close the building was, how
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.800]   the shooter got on the roof and was allowed to take a shot.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.840]   It's pretty astonishing.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.320]   Either it's just got to be complete and total incompetence.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.440]   Obviously, conspiracy theories are forming left, right, and center by everybody, but
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.920]   just seems pretty broadly incompetent at this point in time.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.960]   But what is interesting is you can see anybody who's ever held a rifle and shot a rifle
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.800]   understands how relatively easy political violence is to execute.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.760]   And you can see, I think that you think because of the intense protection that's in place
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.520]   for the current president of the United States, and because of how effective that protection
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.920]   is, people often extrapolate the idea to other politicians that all politicians are protected
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.840]   like the current president of the United States is.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.040]   But that's simply not true.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.360]   Most politicians, their protection details are very, very minimal.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.760]   And in a country like the United States, just about any politician, just about any of us,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   we are subject to being taken out by a long-range rifle shot pretty much at any time.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   And in any city in the United States, any town in the United States, there are thousands
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.640]   of thousands of people who are fully capable with the skills and the knowledge and the
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.440]   practice, as well as the tools of violence, who could pretty much reach out and kill just
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   about any politician.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   So it's a good sobering reminder of that.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.040]   I'm not sure it's a bad thing.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.960]   I'm grateful, of course, that President Trump survived, but it's probably a good thing that
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.640]   politicians recognize that, hey, if things go at the end of the day, a lot of people
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.400]   could kill me if they wanted to.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.080]   And ideally, that allows us to keep a lid on our political rhetoric, trying to keep
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.440]   things tamped down.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.880]   I'm also amazed it doesn't happen more often just because of how big the United States
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.040]   is.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.320]   You have 300 and I don't know what we're approaching, 350 million people.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.680]   I don't remember the current statistics on the population of the US, but let's just
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.560]   call it 350.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.360]   Out of 350 million people, even if the percentage of wackos in the society is relatively small,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   you're still left with thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of potential wackos
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.040]   that can be touched off with just a few words.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.880]   And so we really need to work hard to keep our political rhetoric moderate, modest and
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.640]   pointed rather than moving over into the world of violence, because the entire country could
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.800]   explode into violence without too much difficulty.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.840]   And so my hope is that we will be more responsible with our words and we'll seek to focus on
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.040]   debating one another with ideas and civil debate rather than name-calling, partisanship
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.520]   â€“ and by partisanship I actually mean basically tribal identity, us versus them communication
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.360]   versus sitting down and working on things.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.400]   Some of the things I would love to see us do more of in the United States, I'd love
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.920]   to see us debate more.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.120]   I'd love to see us actually engage in debate about ideas.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.440]   One of the saddest things to me is that the whole concept of debate in our modern age
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.960]   has basically fallen apart, and that we debate for sound clips and things that appear in
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   gotchas and getchas rather than meaningful policy debates.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.760]   That's very frustrating to me.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.280]   I'd like to see us engage in more discussion of ideas that we disagree with, and I'd
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.800]   like to see us do that without demonizing our opponent.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   One of the things that you can always do, that I try to do, is remember that this man
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.520]   that I disagree with, he's not my enemy, he's my opponent.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   And we may disagree on an issue, but we can still be good friends, even though we may
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   disagree on many issues.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.840]   And so I hope that we can build in the future more skill with debate, build more public
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   fora for debate on important ideas, and we've got a lot of work to do.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.880]   I think that it would be really positive to me if we could learn some lessons from the
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.680]   most recent assassination attempt, and we could implement that more and more in our
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.720]   society.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.640]   Alas, I'm not too hopeful of that happening, but I'm doing my best in whatever way I have
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.680]   the opportunity to simply lead by example and try to facilitate that, which I always
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.480]   encourage and facilitate discussion and debate here on this podcast, and I hope that you'll
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.160]   do that in your life too.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.760]   Again, I don't think that I'm going to be able to affect the direction of the country,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   but I hope that I can, in my corner of the world, make some small difference, because
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.880]   this kind of stuff can save lives, really can.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.000]   I think also just related to the current events, it's important to consider what could have
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.240]   happened if things had gone the other way.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.320]   What could have happened if Mr. Trump were dead right now?
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.600]   What could have happened?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   It could have been terrible.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.360]   It could still be terrible.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.280]   Out there right now, there's some crackpot wacko who would love to take out President
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.160]   Biden.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.240]   Political violence is always available.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.920]   And by the way, one more comment on political violence.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   Back to what I said about, I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often in the United
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.080]   States.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.840]   Some months ago, I was looking after theâ€”was it weeks or months?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.960]   Recently, after the most recent Mexican set of elections, I was reviewing a list of people
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.880]   who were assassinated during the presidentialâ€”sorry, during the elections, the general elections
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.400]   all across Mexico, and I was astonished at how extensive the list was.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.920]   I forget the exact number.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.000]   I think it was somewhere between 30 and 40, and some people there were estimates as high
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.200]   as 60.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.520]   But something like 30 to 40 politicians were assassinated during the most recent round
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.880]   of Mexican elections.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.840]   And so this is a decent example.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   It wouldn't be that hard for that kind of thing to happen in the United States again.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.120]   Again, the Americans are much better equipped for that kind of thing than the Mexicans.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.760]   It's just that we don't currently have the culture in which that's a normal and
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.160]   accepted thing for those who wish to destroy the political process.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.680]   And so I think we should be actively working to do everything we can to minimize the risk
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:10.400]   of violence and constantly working to create public fora and the skills within people so
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   that they can debate ideas without demonizing their opponents.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.280]   So I would like to see us to do more with that.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   Now, more on topic for a personal finance podcast.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.800]   I've thought a lot about Donald Trump over the years.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.400]   When I was in college, he was very prominent with The Apprentice Show, and my friends and
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.680]   I, we would host watch parties because we enjoyed it so much.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.520]   And so we would get out, everyone get together and have apprentice watch shows.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.480]   So I became fond of him.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.960]   And after that time, I started reading his books.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.040]   Lost track of him for a long time until he became a candidate.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:54.640]   And it's always been hard with Trump because the web of statements is very hard to pierce
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.960]   and figure out what's true, what's false, what's marketing, what's gimmicky, all of
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   that stuff.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.800]   And his lifestyle and his life, he's never shied away from attention whatsoever.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.520]   But one of the things that I've thought about him many times is how inspiring it is for
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:17.920]   him to keep on going at his age and doing something that he seems to really care about.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:26.240]   As much as I can tell, it seems to me that Donald Trump really seems to care about the
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.480]   political work that he is doing.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.240]   When he first ran for office, I thought, "Well, he doesn't actually want to win.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.520]   He's just doing this on a gimmick.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.760]   He's just doing this as a publicity campaign."
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.880]   I was not a Trump believer or a Trump fan.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.600]   Then he got the nomination.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.760]   Then he ran for president, and I didn't believe anything he said at all.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   And then he got elected.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.600]   And I thought, "Wow, maybe this guy could do it.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.800]   Maybe he could do something."
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.400]   And for me, the most kind of heart-sickening years were those first two years of his first
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:09.040]   presidential term where he had been handed a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.320]   and a Republican President.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.880]   And I vividly remember the day that John McCain gave his famous thumbs-down vote on the floor
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.560]   of the U.S. Senate, and I said, "That's it.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.080]   Republicans are done.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.640]   This whole thing is a waste of time."
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.960]   And it was just an extremely sad moment for me.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.720]   So watching Trump then continue through his first term was rather interesting.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.160]   And then he lost.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.880]   And then he lost.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.960]   And then President Biden won.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   And then Trump didn't give up, didn't quit.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.800]   And I've thought so many times, what a great example of somebody who achieves material
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.560]   success, has enough money that he could live in comfort for the rest of his life, and yet
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.080]   continues to spend his life fighting for something that he really cares about.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:06.400]   And I can't see how somebody who doesn't care could continue to do what that man continues
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.320]   to do and what he continues to fight for.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.960]   And so I've become a great admirer of that instinct of his to keep on pressing through.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.080]   And one of the things that's always very difficult to me to figure out, and I don't
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:24.480]   know that anyone knows, is to try to figure out, is this man actually skillful, or is
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.760]   this just total blind luck?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.480]   You go back and you read all the criticisms of Trump and all of the arguments about how
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   much more wealthy he could be if he had never gone into real estate, and about how incompetent
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.160]   he is, and yet on the flip side, he expresses competence.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.000]   And the lessons that I've taken, let me just sum them up for you in a few things.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.960]   Number one is the way that you are perceived in many cases is more important than who you
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.840]   actually are.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.480]   And so Trump has always been a master of image.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.440]   He's always been extremely conscious of perception.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.920]   And perception is reality to many people.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   And I've been amazed again and again about how he's been able to consistently harness
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.440]   that knowledge and consistently press forward when I sure would have given up.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.800]   And so being aware of how you are perceived and doing your best to present yourself in
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.760]   the way that you want to be perceived is amazing to me.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.000]   I've also been amazed at his ability to use words to change the course of history.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.520]   I remember watching when he was in his first presidential campaign, and he started talking
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   about issues on the border.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.040]   He started making these ludicrous claims that we're going to build a wall across the southern
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.800]   border and Mexico is going to pay for it.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.440]   Completely and totally ludicrous.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.040]   Any person with a few brain cells knew that this is impossible and absurd.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   And yet, by holding the vision forth, he was able to change things.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.360]   And systematically, things started to change.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.840]   People literally started to build walls.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.040]   And I was amazed at the power of words, that we should always pay attention to the power
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.680]   of our words.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.560]   Be careful, of course, with the words that we say, and yet use words for good, to call
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.440]   attention to things that really make a difference.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.000]   So that's something that I came to admire about him, is his ability to use simple speech
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.880]   to literally call things into existence.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.960]   Another thing that I really came to admire about Mr. Trump was how he had succeeded in
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.000]   building a family integrated organization.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.080]   His family is not my idea of a dream family.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:49.760]   I am so astonished at, I can't even imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes with
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.880]   three wives, and who knows how many mistresses, and who knows how many affairs, and all these
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.600]   children from all these different situations.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.920]   And yet, somehow, he's able to pool his family together in something of a family working
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.400]   together.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   And during his first term as president, during his only term as president, when he was a
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.920]   president, I was amazed to see how all of these family members were able to work together
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.320]   and potentially make progress.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.160]   And it certainly was never smooth, and it was never, you know, there were ups and downs,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.800]   but it was inspiring to see a family that was able to work together and have that sense
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.320]   of family identity.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.640]   And in the future, I hope that I can build something like that, where I can have adult
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.000]   sons and daughters who are able to work together, who probably are going to have a whole set
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.440]   of problems, but yet can be committed to loyalty to the family and us doing something important
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.240]   together.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.640]   And so that's something I came to admire about him.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.320]   Then when he left office â€“ well, actually, one more before we get to that â€“ I was also
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.680]   amazed at how he rose to a challenge.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:07.280]   I think the most dramatic video that I used to watch was when then-President Obama appeared
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.440]   on one of the late-night comedy things.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.080]   And he went on and on about, you know, President Trump never going to win.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.720]   And you go back and you watch the White House Correspondents Dinner, where President Trump
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.120]   was basically being roasted from the â€“ excuse me â€“ Trump was being roasted from the stage.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.040]   And you saw kind of the man make a decision.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.480]   And he made a decision, "I'm going to change this, and I'm going to win."
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.760]   And then, against all odds, wins.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:42.000]   Just an astonishing example of somebody pressing forward and being so committed to a path,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.880]   and then things opening up before him.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.960]   And just that indomitable spirit that he has consistently expressed is something that I
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.320]   really admire.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.400]   And then the biggest thing has just been the fact that as old as he is now â€“ I think
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.320]   78, if my understanding is correct â€“ as old as he is now, he has not wasted his 60s
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.440]   and 70s.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:12.160]   He has done something significant with those years of his life, and he's on track to
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.680]   continue to do something significant with his life.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.760]   I've often wondered what a younger Trump would say about the activities that he's
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.680]   undertaken during these years.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.040]   Seems like if you go back in history, maybe it was just because he grew up with all that
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.280]   stuff.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:36.000]   But it seems like what most people aspire to is they aspire to a life of hedonism and
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.680]   consumption, and dream, "Oh, okay, I'm going to make it big and earn a lot of money,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.040]   and I'm going to just go and consume and fly around the world on my yacht.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.920]   After all, what's the point of being a billionaire if you can't enjoy the money?"
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.240]   And just nonstop, never-ending consumption.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:57.840]   And yet, Trump, at a time in his life when he could have gone and lived that way, made
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.720]   a different choice.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.160]   Now, perhaps it was just all personal pride, and he didn't like being the butt of all
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.800]   the jokes, and he said, "I'm going to show them."
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.480]   Perhaps it was kind of a good desire to do good in the world and to change things that
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.200]   he wanted to do.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.040]   Motivation probably in the end really doesn't matter, and nor could I ever know it.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   But the point is, he has made his 60s and his 70s count, and he's going into his ninth
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.360]   decade making his life count.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.040]   And to me, that's something that is extremely inspiring, and that's something that I think
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   we need more of, especially from the baby boom generation.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:45.040]   And I would love us to look at the example of Mr. Trump and learn from that, and try
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.120]   to be committed to doing the same thing.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.480]   If you've achieved material success in your life, do you just want your legacy of your
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.560]   life to be that he sat around and consumed his money?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.480]   Is that the legacy that you want?
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.640]   Or do you want a chance to improve things in a positive direction?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.360]   Do you want a chance to leave your mark on something?
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.240]   And while I would dearly wish that Trump had never gotten involved with presidential politics
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.680]   and the Republican Party and things that I used to care about, I have to concede that
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.400]   he has fundamentally transformed them.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:32.880]   He has used his influence and power to completely transform the political system, to completely
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.720]   transform the Republican Party.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.880]   And that's something that is worthy of respect.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.520]   To see a man who doesn't have to do that go and do that is something that's worthy of
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.400]   respect.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.960]   And so I really appreciate his example in that.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   And I think that's something we should pay attention to.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.280]   Let's make our lives count.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.120]   Let's make our lives...
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.440]   Let's not just wander off and say, "Look, I can travel around the world on my yacht."
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:20:59.920]   Fine.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.080]   Do that for a couple years, take a break.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.280]   But make your life count, especially when you've accumulated power and influence and
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.780]   money.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.920]   Make your life count.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.360]   Do something useful.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.800]   Do something good.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.640]   And just repeating myself, make your life count.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.000]   When I think about Trump and I think about what he could have done with the last 10 years
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.760]   of his life and what instead he chose to do, I got to imagine him lying on his deathbed
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.560]   someday in the future and reflecting.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   And I got to imagine that he would be pretty happy with the decisions that he has made.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.840]   And though those decisions were never easy for him, facing lawsuits and legal problems
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:50.320]   and financial things and all kinds of never-ending setbacks, when the man's lying on his deathbed
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.200]   in the future, I got to imagine he'll have a sense of satisfaction about living his life
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.960]   with focus and determination.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.240]   And I think that's worth paying attention to.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.760]   There are many other men that you can see who have done this.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.960]   I've thought I could create a similar podcast on President Biden and the things that I admire
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.520]   about Biden.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.320]   I probably won't, but I'll just say here.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.960]   Some of the things I admire about President Biden is that he also had that sense of dogged
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   persistence.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.480]   I can't remember, was this the third time he ran for president?
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.320]   And he had a goal for 50 years to become president of the United States and it took him a long
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   time and yet he ultimately was able to accomplish it.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.440]   I have less respect for professional politicians than I do for people who do something else
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.360]   and then turn to politics.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.960]   So it's more difficult for me to really focus on that.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.680]   But I do really respect Biden for his same kind of dogged determination.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:23:03.200]   And I find it interesting that in our society we have these two aged men who both are setting
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.000]   the example for us of basically not giving up.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.880]   There's decent argument to be made that there should be a point in time in which you give
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.360]   up.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.040]   And I think that's also something that we should factor in.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   If you're critical of Donald Trump or if you're critical of President Biden and you think
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.240]   they should be given up, then because of their age and because of the diminished capacity
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.920]   of reaching a certain age, then you should be thinking about that in your own context.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:37.280]   But let's make that 70 whatever it is, 78, rather than focusing on doing that at 58.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.960]   Don't waste your 50s and 60s and 70s.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.320]   It's a time that you can make a difference if you're able to.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.600]   And that's something that we should focus on and gain.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.720]   So those are just some lessons that I have drawn from current events and everything associated
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.440]   with the current world.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.600]   Try to go through the world and make a list of people that you admire and things that
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.800]   you admire about them.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:08.240]   And if you can create that list while looking at the world, then you'll have a lens to then
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:14.880]   turn on to your own life and look at your own life and say, "Here's something that I
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.120]   can learn from this person, and here's how I may be applied in my own life."
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.880]   I don't think that for most of us, going into politics is a fruitful endeavor.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:30.160]   It is something that I have watched many men do, and I respect them for their effort.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   And it may be a fruitful endeavor for some of us.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.280]   So I'm not trying to encourage people to go into politics, though I think that that pathway
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:44.880]   to go and be a man of business or medicine or engage in some kind of important career
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.000]   and then to turn your mind towards statementship, that's something that's worthy of respect.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.680]   But the political game is difficult to actually make a difference in.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:01.120]   But recognize, though, that you can still take the lessons that you gain from a politician
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.200]   and then apply them in another area that may perhaps be much more fruitful.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.800]   That's it for today's show.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.480]   Let's be grateful for a life that was spared.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.880]   Let's learn some lessons from it, and let's press on together.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.960]   Innovative materials.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.480]   Unexpected colorways.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   And fresh, clean styles that rise above trends.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.680]   That's how our friends at MVMT design their California Modern watches.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.160]   And to celebrate their 11-year anniversary, they're having a huge sale with up to 60%
