[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about solving the happiness money conundrum in five moves or less
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.480]   So if you live in America or you live in Canada or developed European country or Hong Kong Singapore, Australia
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.720]   you got more money than the large majority of the world's population and
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.480]   Yet you might not be very happy
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   And I think the reason why you might not be very happy is because you're spending too much time
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400]   Focusing on money power and prestige and not enough time on everything else
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.800]   So I don't think money makes up more than 40% of what makes us happy
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.960]   The other stuff is just much more important, but we neglect that other stuff
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   Which I'm going to talk about in this episode and I think these are the things that will really make us happy
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.240]   So after a tense 14 to 12 softball victory, I'm in this weekly law league softball
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.600]   League and it's funny because I'm not a lawyer. I just decided to play because someone invited me
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.200]   The six of us went to a nearby brewery for some beers
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.400]   oysters burgers and so forth and we were just elated because the team was really really good and we got some clutch hits and
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.320]   I ended up sitting next to this guy really big guy six feet five inches tall
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.000]   Crushes the ball 300 plus feet and he's our cleanup hitter and let's call him Biff and in high school
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   Biff said he was a pretty popular guy. He played varsity baseball
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   varsity basketball
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.880]   But he also admitted he was a little bit cruel
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.800]   cruel to the smaller kids most kids were smaller than him and then cruel to the exchange students and
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.720]   I asked him why was he so cruel and he said well I was
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.760]   Because I was immature and because I could and he told me he wasn't proud of his actions
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.880]   And he wished he could apologize to them today
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   and I see a lot of
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.440]   Biffs nowadays in the real world and in the online world where you know
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.080]   They were just kind of cruel and bullies when they're in school and they turned out to be bullied
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.600]   Bullies and really really kind of nasty people as adults
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.920]   So anyway after the financial crisis hit in 2008 Biff fell into a deep depression
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.140]   The house he had bought when he was 27 years old ended up losing half its value
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.120]   He was told he couldn't lose and that real estate was the surefire way to riches
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.320]   Not only had he lost all his equity, but he also owed more than the house was worth in just one year
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.840]   So Biff proceeded to gain over a hundred pounds as he literally locked himself within his rapidly depreciating prison at age 30
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   He was morbidly obese
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.800]   broke and
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.200]   Girlfriendless life had no more meaning to him and he definitely contemplated suicide
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.000]   But good thing he didn't because one day out of the blue the state of Florida threw him a lifeline by offering him a free
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.640]   $75,000 to pay off some of his mortgage if he promised to keep up with the regular payments
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.320]   he took advantage of the taxpayers money and fulfilled his side of the deal and
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.680]   Despite feeling a little bit guilty for taking the bailout money
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   Biff started gaining positive momentum in his life again over the ensuing two years. He lost about 70 pounds
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.080]   he got a promotion at work and
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.400]   Finally at the age of 32 found a girlfriend
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.200]   He also very importantly
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   Stopped hating on anybody and everybody who seemed to be doing better than him because he was finally in a better place himself
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.640]   The first step to him feeling happy was to make sure his finances were no longer going in reverse. They had stabilized and
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.320]   Once they had stabilized Biff's happiness grew because he found someone who loved him despite all his flaws
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:02.040]   Today, they're married and they have a daughter and he's happy being rich didn't matter any more to Biff
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.580]   Making progress did oh and being able to win a softball game by crushing it over the fence
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.520]   300 plus feet
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.000]   Makes him really really happy and I tell you the story because I truly believe that money is not the primary driver to happiness
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.400]   At most 40% in my opinion if you look at the post on the polls
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.160]   50% is at most according to about 700 votes if you look at the annual world happiness report
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.200]   So the latest one comes out
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.240]   Came out recently and Finland Norway and Denmark are in the top three
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.600]   and the the reality is that these countries are always in the top five to top ten and
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.240]   The report highlighted six significant factors which contributed to happiness
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.840]   GDP per capita social support life expectancy freedom to make life choices
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   Generosity and corruption levels and if you look at the United States, it's ranked 18
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.240]   So it's kind of weird because we have by far the largest
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.920]   GDP in the world, you know, but being 18 there's kind of some kind of disconnect and
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.680]   It's just such a conundrum that I think and the report attributed several reasons as to why Americans are not happier
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   They include wealth and inequality
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.840]   obesity right like my friend Biff substance abuse and
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   Depression and all of these things seem to kind of go hand in hand together
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.080]   The United States on a GDP per capita basis ranks only about 19. So that's pretty much in line with the happiness ranking
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.520]   however
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.480]   GDP per capita alone doesn't neatly explain why more of the wealthiest countries aren't in the top ten
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:48.040]   For example, Singapore has a GDP per capita of about ninety four thousand and that is number seven
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.800]   but yet it's ranked only 34th in the world for happiness and
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   My my hypothesis is that's just too damn hot and humid out there in Singapore
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   So I used to live in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for four years, but gotta say food in Singapore is top three in the world
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.240]   So I wanted to figure out
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.920]   What are the things we should spend more of our time on?
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.760]   To make us more happy and I want to do some reflection because I think this is really important ultimately financial samurai is
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.720]   A site to help get your finances, right? So you're no longer going in reverse
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.880]   You've stabilized you're going forward and you can spend the majority of your time not worrying about money
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.360]   Really because the money is making money for you and it's going to be there for you, but you can spend more of your time
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.280]   Optimizing for the other things that hopefully will make your life more meaningful
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   So there are five things that I think are really important. The first one is independence
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.680]   Independence grows over time the first taste of independence usually comes when you're able to live on your own without parental assistance
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.000]   Perhaps it's going away to school or landing your first job
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.480]   Independence continues to grow once you start gaining respect and mastery at your job the better you are at your job
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.700]   Generally the more leeway you're gonna be given to do what you want
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.520]   You might eventually get promoted to run a team or a department giving you even more independence
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.780]   You finally gain maximum independence when you no longer have to report to anybody
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.880]   Most think retirement is the ultimate goal, but based on my experience
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.200]   After being away from the workforce for seven years
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.280]   Retirement isn't a cure-all for happiness. There's plenty of negatives. You got to deal with as well, which again means money is not
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:37.880]   Money is not the main point for making people happy. Some people believe that entrepreneurship leads to maximum independence
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.120]   Instead entrepreneurship can lead to tremendous dependence if you hire workers and take in investors
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:52.320]   What people really want is a profitable bootstrapped solo business or the financial independence to do whatever without caring about money
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.680]   In my case, I was pretty happy to have a job right out of college, even though they worked me like a dog
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.660]   But after about I don't know three to six months that happiness really begin that began to fade
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.120]   Because it's just too stressful and too arduous. So my happiness level is probably around a six
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   It was only until I moved to San Francisco and got some more
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.840]   Independence covering West Coast clowns and feeling like I was in a more entrepreneurial
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.440]   Office environment did my happiness take a tick up?
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.200]   But then the financial crisis hit and then I was feeling a little bit miserable again
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.640]   and so it was only after I negotiated a severance in 2012 did my happiness level creep up to about an eight out of ten and
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:38.480]   Has remained at roughly this level with temporary spikes to ten and then obviously temporary spikes to like five or six
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.920]   So for those of you who want happiness
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:49.040]   Try your best to figure out an occupation or something that will give you as much independence as possible
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.560]   Independence has been I think the most important factor in consistently keeping me
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.700]   Happier at a higher level. So to
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.800]   Family no matter how much of a knucklehead you are most family members will provide unconditional love and forgiveness
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   They will support you no matter what it is estimated that average friendship lasts only seven years
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:18.720]   Because life gets in the way maybe a job relocate someone you just maybe you lose interest or you have a family
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Whatever it is while friends come and go family members last for much much longer
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.640]   We must make an effort to regularly keep in touch with our parents and siblings
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.680]   in my situation
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.560]   I messed up a lot in high school and in grade school gotten you know suspensions because of fights
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.280]   Did some other bad things and I think in retrospect man. I think I gave my parents a lot of
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.880]   Headache and anxiety so sorry guys
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.240]   I'm gonna try to do better. Well, it's actually too late
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.200]   So I'm gonna try to teach my kids to do a little bit better
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.280]   But they've always been supportive whether you know when I got suspended from school or when I decided to change jobs
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.560]   They're like no the money's probably not gonna be worth their misery going to New York City
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:09.640]   And when I decided to leave work for good in 2012 at 34, they never had any pushback. They were just like well
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:16.360]   That's interesting. Let's talk about the pros and cons and what you want to do just really supportive and even when I
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.240]   Decided to get married. They were also so welcoming to my wife
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.400]   So I really really appreciate my parental support and I would say I'd give them eight out of ten
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   They've always been there
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.040]   They haven't been like super lovey-dovey like you see in the movies and stuff, but they've always picked up my calls and been supportive
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.240]   three
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   Your own family. I think this is pretty important for happiness as well
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.440]   If you're lucky enough to find a life partner, there's nobody you will love more in this world
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.560]   If you want to have children, and if you do have children the amount of joy you will experience is beyond anything you can ever imagine
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.840]   I
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.320]   Understand that not everybody wants children. In fact about 10 11 percent of you in my survey of over a thousand
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.640]   Said you do not want children and that's absolutely fine
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.280]   Having a family made up of just you and your soulmate is incredibly powerful
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.920]   So much freedom so much joy make it your mission to find someone who loves you as much as you love them
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.840]   In my situation, I got really really lucky. I met my wife when I was a senior in college and she was a freshman
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.880]   Because I met my wife so early. I've always had this minimum elevated level of contentment
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   I knew that worst case if I could only make minimum wage working at McDonald's
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.600]   At least I'd have her in my life and we'd make things work and she felt the same way
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.760]   It didn't really matter how much money we had
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.320]   You know what we did is just like well we have each other
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.520]   So we'll figure it out and when you have some partner that will always support you and allow you to figure things out as you go
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.800]   Along, it's incredibly incredibly powerful. And when we finally had our boy in 2017 my happiness
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.960]   Temporarily rocketed to a 10 10 plus. I don't know maybe a 15 is it was like unlocking a feeling
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.000]   I had never known before and nobody really kind of tells you that for some reason
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.800]   But I'm telling you guys who want kids or thinking about kids. There's this unlocked feeling that you have when you have your own
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:20.200]   But as many first-time stay-at-home parents know taking care of a kid is tremendously difficult
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.920]   Some more than others right? I have a boy. He's very strong-willed. He knows what he wants. Like us what he wants
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   Maybe he's kind of like me pretty
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   Spool-headed and his temper tantrums are out of control at 26 months old
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.480]   And so that kind of doesn't make me happy that kind of makes me miserable sometimes
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   But I wouldn't trade it for the world
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.480]   for
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.960]   The ability to stand up for yourself
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.280]   I don't hear about this much, but I think this is very very important
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.480]   One of the worst feelings is getting bullied and not being able to do anything about it in school
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.280]   You might get picked on by a bigger kid. You want to fight back, but you're afraid of getting your face punched in
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.400]   So you rationalize? Okay better to give him my lunch money and starve than face his wrath
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.800]   At work, you might get tormented by a senior colleague
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.120]   You want to tell her stop look just leave me alone. Why are you always making fun of me in public?
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.440]   Why are you making me look bad? Why are you throwing me under the bus?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.760]   But you're afraid of standing up for yourself because you might afraid you might get a bad review from her
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.040]   You need the money
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960]   Because I don't know you're raising a family. You bought a house. You bought a car, whatever it is
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.080]   online
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   You're afraid to say what you truly think out of fear of getting ridiculed
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   As a result you keep quiet and you might even join a mob that bullies others for thinking differently
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:50.560]   The fear of standing up for yourself and others is one of the reasons why bad things stay bad for a very very long time
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:58.920]   It's amazing how people aren't willing to step up and stand up for what they believe in or defend someone
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:05.000]   Who's you know being bullied or whatever because they're afraid of getting bullied or mobbed themselves. It's kind of sad
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.040]   so my situation ever since
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   Elementary school for some reason must be DNA. I've had the courage to fight back and stand up for myself. I
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   Hated bullies and I never never let them push me around or call me names and if they did
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.320]   They would feel my fist of fury and this was me as an elementary school kid
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.560]   And what I learned since I was a kid while standing up for yourself is that even if you take a few blows
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.760]   The bullies eventually stop some start respecting you some may even apologize
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.120]   The repercussions were plenty frankly
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.640]   Suspensions multiple trips to the principal's office and a few bruises
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.880]   But it always felt great to defend my honor. So I've been going through this since at least five years old
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.600]   I can remember so many altercations from five years old
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   through college frankly
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.880]   I've carried this attitude of standing up for myself my entire adult life when there was BS happening at work
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.460]   I spoke up often to my own detriment
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.800]   I didn't appreciate nepotism and nepotism is very very strong in the corporate workplace
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.660]   The higher you go the higher you ascend in the ranks the more it's about who you know
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.300]   And not what you do and I often challenge senior employees whom I did not respect
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.000]   And this is terrible terrible career strategy
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Don't do what I do if you want to send the corporate ranks and get like that network of support
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.880]   Because when my big bosses who are in my corner were eventually pushed out
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:40.560]   I was left with few backers and this caused me not to be able to ascend to managing director
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.200]   Among other things right financial crisis and having to relocate to a headquarter office yada yada yada
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.160]   But for me, I knew my career was over at this firm. I had made too many enemies or just ruffled too many feathers
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.360]   It's because I didn't it's just I just called out so much BS. It was just whatever and
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.980]   Then online financial samurai has grown large enough to attract
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.900]   Unfortunately some hateful comments every week from people like the old Biff
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:14.000]   We're talking racist comments just really offensive comments and you know tons and tons of spam is just kind of crazy
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   you guys have no idea and
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.200]   Even if only 0.1 percent of the people hate your guts
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.560]   however, that's
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:29.520]   1,000 people a month if you receive 1 million visitors a month and that's what financial samurai receives about 1 million visitors a month
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   And actually it's not point 1% It's probably more like point
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:40.200]   001 percent but still even if you have like 10 haters every single month leaving you nasty stuff
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.120]   It's kind of annoying and kind of perturbing
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.480]   I generally delete 99% but if someone is stupid enough to try to come at me
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.520]   someone who doesn't rely on money to live who doesn't have a job to live and
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.880]   If you're stupid enough to still come after someone in this situation and you yourself need a job
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.440]   Well, there's probably something bad's gonna happen to you because I'm gonna stand up for myself
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.920]   Too many people too many people kind of ruin their their careers frankly
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:18.560]   Because they do something stupid online social media or whatever. So just really think twice or thrice if you need money to survive
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.840]   Before you write anything nasty or you come to someone's house and hate on them. It's just not worth it
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.160]   So this is really one of the biggest benefits of being unemployed is not being able to get fired
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.840]   So standing up for yourself can feel initially scary
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.320]   but the more you practice I promise you the easier it'll get and
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:45.840]   Then finally the final thing that I think will make people happy or happier is doing work that is helpful to others
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:53.400]   One of the reasons why 70% of people are disengaged at work is because they know what they do is probably not very helpful to society
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.880]   Think about the workers who work at PepsiCo
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:03.280]   Their entire goal is to sell sugary drinks and process foods that get people addicted and fat and sick
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.280]   That can't feel very good and then imagine working at Juul
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:14.520]   Their goal is to get adults and teenagers hooked on vaporized nicotine. I mean, how do you feel good about that?
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   How do you feel good about getting people addicted and hooked to something that's poisonous? It's just beyond me
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.600]   It doesn't feel good. And I think deep down
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.920]   Every single employee knows this and that's why again 70% of people are disengaged
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:36.240]   But if you create or do something that's helpful to others, you will feel extremely extremely wealthy talk to veteran nurses
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.840]   Teachers firefighters and social workers really listen to them
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.680]   You will hear many of them glow about their rewarding careers
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:52.760]   Sure, they'll have issues just like everybody else pay office politics and so forth, but it's really a big difference
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.680]   In my situation before 9/11 happened. It felt great working in finance in New York City
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.280]   After 9/11, I felt a tremendous amount of sadness
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.480]   Deep sadness suddenly nothing I did at work mattered anymore compared to what the brave
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.040]   First responders did to try and rescue the people trapped in the World Trade Centers
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:18.280]   I wanted to join the US Foreign Service to actually serve my country and do something more productive like my parents
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.640]   But I was neither smart enough or motivated enough to pass those exams
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.300]   It took at least three years to get over my disillusionment of working in finance
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.200]   During this time. I went to business school part-time
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.040]   Partly to see if I could gain some knowledge to do something else just kind of explore
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.160]   That's what you do when you go to business school
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:45.720]   but part of the deal of having my tuition paid for was to continue working at my firm for at least two years after graduation and
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.560]   During this time, unfortunately, the financial crisis had hit in 2008 and there was nowhere I could go
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.360]   The best I could do was hold on tight for my employment life as I had just taken out a 1.1
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.200]   Million dollar mortgage in 2006 when I was 28 years old
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.280]   I mean that was everything I had after the town payment and that's scary stuff
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.000]   so it wasn't until about
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.600]   2011
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.640]   That I decided that my biggest joy was writing and helping people get their finances straight
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.840]   I started financial samurai in 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis and
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.980]   That was a period where I had to really reassess what I wanted to do with my life and by 2012
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.480]   2011 all I could think about was financial samurai. So
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   That's what I did. I finally said goodbye to my employer then and the thing that has kept me going for so long
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.280]   I mean 10 years. It's just kind of crazy
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.520]   Three to four times a week of writing something commenting
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.600]   producing things
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.740]   It's man. It's just tiring thinking about it
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.080]   But what has kept me going for so long has been the consistent positive feedback that I get from readers that outnumber the negative feedback
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.600]   Probably 200 to 1
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:06.560]   Over the past 10 years. I've witnessed readers eradicate their debt fix their spending habits buy their first homes
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:14.120]   Leave toxic work environments negotiate amazing severances create thriving side hustles build substantial
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.560]   retirement portfolios start families and so much more
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   It's been really a wonderful journey and an honor and a treat to hear from each and every one of you. So, thank you
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:31.880]   Before you reach financial independence, you might get tricked into believing that money is the main reason why people are happy
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.680]   It's easy to lose sight of all the things on your quest for greater wealth
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.800]   However, you can be the richest person in the world
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.520]   but if you have nobody to share your fortune with I
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.460]   Doubt you'll be happier than someone making 40,000 a year in a job in which he or she loves
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.920]   And who has a loving partner and supportive friends in real life
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.560]   For the sake of happiness. I think it's worth staying fit
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.640]   finding people in real life who love you as much as we love them and
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.680]   Doing something that's helpful to others and who knows you might even reach a point where you're so happy
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.400]   That money starts pouring in as a byproduct
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.440]   So I'd love to hear from all of you on what you think the proper percentages are for money family
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.480]   Purpose. I really think we need to focus more much more on everything else besides money
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.140]   Let's get our money, right? Let's keep it from going in reverse. Let's keep it safe
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.440]   Let's keep the money productive so that it can free up
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.040]   Tremendous amount of time to spend on things that truly matter. Thanks so much everyone
