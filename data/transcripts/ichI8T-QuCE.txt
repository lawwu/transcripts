[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   I think Chamath's point is right, though. There is so much more liquidity available through access
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.840]   to retail and international market participants in a public setting than there is in a private
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.240]   setting. And it is because of this liquidity premium and the easy access to putting capital in.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.760]   It's just extraordinary how much, as I've watched close friends and companies and companies I've
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.440]   invested in, and I'm sure you guys have done the same, transition from private to public,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.240]   the valuation jump is extraordinary on a metrics basis. So whatever the metric might be,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.960]   you get public, there is this flurry of market participation. And as a result,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.200]   it drives up. There's a multiple expansion. Wait, wait. I thought...
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.960]   Your BSPR, sorry, can I just say something? That's such an important,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.720]   smart thing that Friedberg said. So Jason, for example, all of us,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   we're all still in the private markets. And I'm not trying to take away from the private markets,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.640]   but what David said is so important. If you used to look at a SaaS deal,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   you'd price that SaaS deal 10 times ARR. Then there's a little bit of inflation,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.840]   the rates go up, the prices that people pay go up. Now all of a sudden we're paying 12 times,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   15 times. Now it's 20 times if you're growing 100% rate over year. So what's happened?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.240]   The market has become more efficient and the excess return is getting eaten up.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.560]   And so you're like, "Okay, well, that's still really good." And you wait four, five,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.160]   six years and you think you're going to get paid. The crazy thing is once that company transitions to
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.200]   the public markets, I mean, all of a sudden, if you actually turn the investor base over and you
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.160]   actually create a float so that public market guys can buy it, they'll pay 30 times.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.040]   That's right.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.960]   35 times, 40 times. So there's a massive multiple expansion. So
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.280]   companies should be going public sooner.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.720]   If you think about this, if I'm trying to raise money for one of my companies,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.000]   I'm going to call on my 10, 20, 30 friends that I know that are investors in private markets and
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.280]   say, "Hey guys, do you want to look at this company?" And maybe I'll get two or three
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.960]   interested parties and maybe we'll kind of agree on what a fair valuation would be.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.200]   If I could take that same company and instantly make it available to a million investors,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   and all I need to do, by the way, is raise $10 million. All I need is some small number of them
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.200]   to write a couple of hundred dollar check. And I'm able to fill that round out. The valuation
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   as a result of the liquidity available in that market is so much higher because everyone's going
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520]   to... There's going to be much more participation in bidding. And so, you know, what I think Chamath
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.160]   has tapped into with the SPAC vehicle and what Robinhood is realizing, and I don't think that we
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.360]   all talk about this enough, but there's this massive, massive, massive market of international
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   investors, of small, of international retail investors who are now rushing into US equities.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.520]   Freeberg, didn't we see that in the ICO craze as well? I think if we took anything from the ICO
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.720]   craze, it was the global appetite for risk and the dot-com boom before that. And I think we have to
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   see that in the market. And I think that's the thing that's really important. And I think that's
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.560]   the thing that's really important. And I think that's the thing that's really important.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.000]   Everybody's copying you down the SPAC path, Chamath. At this point,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720]   I had Desktop Metal as an early angel investment that just SPACed.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.000]   I did the pipe too. I co-led the pipe.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.920]   Thank you. Yeah. And then they told me that. Thank you for the markup. And I've been hearing,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.360]   if I'm getting inbound as an angel investor from... I literally got a cold email from some
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.520]   high-profile people and they're like, "Hey, do you have anything for us to SPAC?" I mean,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.560]   this is like the third or fourth time people are coming down to my dipshit level of, "Hey,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.200]   do you have anything for us to SPAC?" I'm like, "No, we don't." And they're like, "No, we don't."
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.680]   And I'm like, "No, we don't." And they're like, "No, we don't." And I'm like, "No, we don't." And
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.760]   they're like, "No, we don't." And I'm like, "No, we don't." And I'm like, "No, we don't." And I'm like,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.560]   "Can you introduce us to the calm guys? Can you introduce them to Robinhood?" And I'm like,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   "I think you can go direct to them." But what is your take on how many SPACs have been created since
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.680]   you literally single-handedly restarted the SPAC movement, Chamath? I don't think you've ever gone
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.200]   on record about this. I'm really proud of what we did. When we created this thing two years ago,
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   I said I want to basically create a new way of doing IPOs. I called it IPO 2.0. I reserved IPO A
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   through Z on the NYSE. I hope to fulfill that, and I think I will. But taking a step back for a
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.040]   second, in the year 2000, there were 8,000 public companies in America on the American stock
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.560]   exchanges. And in the year 2020, there are 4,000. So we've shrunk in half the number of public
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.720]   companies while we're still doing IPOs. And that's a huge step forward. And I think that's
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.960]   a huge step forward. And I think that's a huge step forward. And I think that's a huge step forward.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   Well, at the same time, we've 10x the amount of capital and the number of people. So we don't
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.560]   have a large enough surface area in the public markets. That's why companies are better off going
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.480]   public because they're going to have a much more receptive audience of people that are dying to own
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   growth of any kind. What's the earliest and the median that people should go public?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.240]   So here's the thing. So if you're one of 30 companies in a venture portfolio that's
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.040]   growing at 50 plus percent, you're one of 30. But when you go public, you're one of one.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.920]   When you're growing 50, 60%, you become very unique all of a sudden. You're a 1% kind of a
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.040]   company. You're an outlier. And so you get treated incredibly well. So that's the backdrop. I think a
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.240]   company should be going public around year five, year six.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.080]   What revenue footprint?
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.760]   About 50 million. At 50 million, when they're doubling, I think that's a huge step forward.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.520]   And then when they're doubling, I think that they should be going up. And it allows them to build
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.600]   capital slowly. It allows them to basically contain control. It minimizes dilution. I think
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.000]   it's a really powerful model. And then on the number of SPACs, what I would say is I think it's
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.520]   really good that the market is getting diversified. I think what's going to happen is the thing with
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.200]   SPACs is it's going to be no different than in some ways the banks that preceded us,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   which is that there's going to be a distribution. You can go to Goldman Sachs, and that'll
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   mean one thing. You can go to Merrill Lynch or B of A or UBS or Jefferies. It'll mean other things.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.000]   You can go to Allen and Company. It'll mean yet another different set of things. And I'm sure
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.400]   there's going to be an organization that is all about cost. Some is going to be all about
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.080]   relationships. So I just think that's going to be the distribution. My personal perspective, it's
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.760]   probably us and maybe one or two other people who really dominate the space. And I'll tell you the
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.800]   only reason why I say that. I think it's going to be a distribution. I think it's going to be a
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.640]   distribution. I think it's going to be a distribution. I think it's going to be a
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.240]   really important when these people try to get these SPACs done, what they're going to realize
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.640]   is it's really hard. And it's hard for a couple of reasons. Number one is you have to marry
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   operational insight and public market sophistication. And the founder will get
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   really smart about being able to figure out whether this person is just a financial arbitrage
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.320]   or if the person has enough operational experience to deeply understand the business. Why?
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   You have to translate it to the public markets well. That's one huge, huge, huge, huge, huge,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.500]   I think that's one huge thing that I think that people will
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.300]   will start, we'll start to hone in on. Anyways, there's a bunch
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.940]   of other things. But are you now competing with the sacks the
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.700]   sacks agree with the 50 million? Yeah, sure. Um, I'm cool with
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.140]   that. You know, I invest well before that. So I'd be I'd be
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.060]   happy for you probably have a bigger portfolio $50 million
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.460]   investments. Yeah, it is. It's great for for for me and Jason,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.400]   and I you know, I think Jumauf deserves a ton of credit one on
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.500]   one. It is I don't know if all the listeners are aware of this,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.920]   but the SPAC things become a huge wave. There's a ton of
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.100]   people creating them. Kevin Hart says a new one Reid Hoffman
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   has a new one. There you're the East Coast hedge fund guys,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.580]   pink us and and then the East Coast hedge funds like Bill
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.080]   Ackman, wherever they're all creating them. So Jumauf has
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.000]   really started a wave here. And I think the appeal of a SPAC to
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.760]   a founder, I'll put in a plug of why I think it's a good idea for
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.560]   a founder consider this is because you essentially what
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.340]   founders are used to is doing, you know, private rounds, right?
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.300]   You agree on a on an amount raised and evaluation, and it's a
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.840]   percent dilution and you're done. That's it. And that's
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.140]   simple, right? And when you IPO and need to raise money, it's
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.600]   not like that you have to then work with an investment bank,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.880]   they'll put together a book you do like a roadshow, you do this
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.600]   whole dog and pony thing, you don't know how much money you're
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.760]   gonna get at the end of that process or what the valuations
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.260]   gonna be. And then on top of that, we know statistically Bill
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.620]   Gurley's published all the stats. And then you have a lot of people
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.360]   who are going to be like, Oh, Bill Gurley's published all the
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.780]   stats, the investment banks are going to rip you off. So you
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.800]   know, so that what a SPAC does is it prices like a late stage
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.420]   private round, you disagree with a SPAC promoter on evaluation and
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.840]   amount raised. And then on top of it, you get kind of a direct
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.200]   listing along with it. Now all of a sudden, you start trading
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   as a public company. And so a SPAC is like a combination
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.980]   direct listing plus private round. And I think that's going
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.680]   to be appealing to a lot of founders, as they start to
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.180]   discover the SPAC.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.060]   It's going to feel more like doing a Series D than it does a
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.300]   roadshow. And I think that comfort level for somebody like
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.580]   Robinhood or Calm or DataStax or Thumbtack or any of these
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.180]   companies that you and I are investors in.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.380]   Every company in your portfolio.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:57.140]   I'm just, listen, I got two IPOs in two years. This is I think
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.780]   this is going to be the new thing for early stage investors
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.500]   is we're not going to count unicorns anymore. We're going to
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.020]   count SPACs. We're going to count public listings, right? And, and
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.020]   I think that's probably better.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.560]   By the way, the other the other thing that I'll say to founders
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.780]   is one is I think you need to you need to think about do these
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.900]   people have the combination of operational and financial acumen
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.460]   in the public markets and investing experience in the
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   public markets and the operational credibility to
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.140]   describe the business and I think you can trade off one for
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.720]   the other if one is so deep, meaning if Warren Buffett was
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.820]   doing his back, you'd say, well, he has no operational
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.540]   experience, but he's so credible in the public markets, then, you
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.700]   know, that's all that matters. But you need to be super, super
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.780]   deep in one or have a really brilliant and thoughtful level
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.020]   of credibility in the public's meaning an early stage investor
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.260]   who isn't married to somebody who can basically say, I know
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.620]   how hedge funds work, I've made them money, and I'm going to
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.580]   make them more money, and mutual funds, etc, is troublesome. The
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.680]   second thing is for founders, you have to really make sure you
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.500]   understand what is in it for the person that's doing this back. I
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.780]   mean,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.660]   in every deal i write a minimum of 100 million dollars personally and that's a lot and so i
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.380]   get in the game i feel very much at risk and so i take a lot of time to make sure these things go
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.060]   well and then the third is that for the spac person what i'll tell them is they are going to find
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.340]   that there's a bunch of landmines and i'm not going to you know say it up front because i
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.260]   think it'll be fun for them to find out themselves along the way but these things are hard the first
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.420]   The first one took me two and a half years.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.260]   They're hard.
