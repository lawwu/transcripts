[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, I am your
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.400]   host, and today it's Friday, and on Fridays I do a live call-in show. Whenever I can arrange
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.800]   the appropriate technology, I do a live call-in show. My favorite shows of the week, I hope
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.160]   they're yours too, I hope you at least enjoy them, because we never know what the phone
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.240]   lines hold.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.240]   Friday shows are where I open up a live phone line to the listeners, and I go to the phone,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600]   and then whatever is waiting there, that's what we deal with. So I hope that you enjoy
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.800]   these shows. Now my life is getting a little bit more stable, my household is getting a
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   little bit more quiet, so that means that my production schedule will be a little bit
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.280]   more consistent with these shows. We begin today, however, with Andy in Indiana. Andy,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   welcome to the show, how can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.880]   Thank you for taking my call. I just had a, I guess, hopefully a quick question about
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:02.040]   the kind of financial protection for a less financially active spouse. So my wife doesn't
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.800]   work outside the home, doesn't earn an income, and is not super interested in finances, so
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.240]   I guess I've seen a tendency in our lives and our relationship that I end up with more
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.440]   things titled in my name and more things building my credit and stuff because I'm the one doing
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.680]   it. I guess I was curious if you thought there was any reason to be concerned about that,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.200]   or specific steps to take to make sure, you know, if I were to pass away or something
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   putting her out on her own, you know, not like handicapping her in the future, if that
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   makes sense.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.340]   Yeah, I think it's a big concern, and definitely it's something that you should be thinking
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.720]   about and you should be planning for. Probably the worst scenario is often the death of a
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.240]   spouse. Very frequently relationships will reflect what you've just described, where
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.280]   there's one spouse that's more interested in money. Sometimes it'll be the spouse who
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.120]   is the income earner, sometimes it'll be a spouse who's not an income earner, but usually
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   there will be, or frequently, there will be a spouse that's more interested in money than
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.880]   the other. And I think that it's probably a good thing that it is that way because I
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.200]   think those of us who are more on the type A, super control, want to have all the control
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.920]   over the budget, want to have beautiful spreadsheets over how everything looks. I think those of
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   us who are in that situation are more likely, we'd probably be pretty frustrated dealing
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.760]   with somebody who is exactly that same way. Maybe we just have to find peace in the household,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   we'd have to have two different sets of budgets put together. And if we had two different
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.080]   sets of budgets, two different spreadsheets, maybe we could find peace. So the situation
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.600]   you're describing is the normal situation where there's one person that is more involved
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.440]   in the money. But it can be a huge problem if one of the spouse, if the person who's
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   involved in the money, leaves for some reason. Sometimes that leaving can be divorce, sometimes
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.200]   death. Death is probably the worst one because there's an immediate severing of the person's
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.480]   input and whatever exists, exists. So I guess my answer to that question, I would cover
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.640]   two basic things. The simple thing that is the more overlooked thing is actually access
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.680]   to information. And for some people, this could be more complex than others. Now if
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.440]   you have one bank account that's a joint checking account that you have at your local
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.720]   community bank and you do your banking in person down at that local community bank,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.920]   then it's fairly simple if you die for your wife to go down to the local branch of that
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.720]   local community bank and while she's there, she can talk to the banker and they can say
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.520]   here's the money and yes, you're on the checking account and they can work it out.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.420]   I doubt any of our financial lives are all that simple. Most of us have more than one
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.640]   bank account. At least I encourage people to have more than one bank account. In addition,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.320]   I encourage people to have a diversified banking structure, not to just have all your banking
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.220]   in one local community. I think most of us should have a couple different banking relationships
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.960]   that are strategically chosen for maximum benefit. A strategically chosen banking relationship
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.680]   is probably unlikely to be in your town. Maybe your main bank account is in your town, but
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.000]   you might have other funds stashed in other towns and other banks. I recommend that some
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.840]   of those banks even be international banks. Now that can be much more complex. As you
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.040]   say, what can often happen is for ease of functioning, your name might wind up on more
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.120]   things. I know my wife and I used to register things like cars together, but then if we
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.280]   were going to sell it or do something, I found it annoying to have both of us have to be
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   there. I came to the point where if a car is registered in a name, it's registered in
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.360]   my name because I would be the one who would go and do it. The same with other assets as
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.840]   well. The same thing can happen with bank accounts. If you're going to go and open up
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.920]   a bank account in the Cayman Islands or in Canada or in Hong Kong or something, are you
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.360]   all going to fly there together and do that or does just one of you go and open the account?
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.320]   A lot of times it's easier for one of you to go, but now here's the problem. How is
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.280]   your wife, if she's not on the account, how is she going to know about that information?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.440]   The first thing I think that needs to be done is you need to have a letter of instruction
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:34.000]   and a clear listing of what we own and where. That document, depending on your level of
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.240]   security and personal paranoia, that document can be stored in a number of different ways.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.400]   The first thing is you can resort to the simple paper method where you have a file drawer
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.960]   with clearly labeled file cabinets. In the file cabinets you would have a section marked
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.000]   bank accounts and you have a manila file folder for each of your bank accounts. Then you put
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   the statements in there so at least then when you're dead she can go to the financial
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   drawer and she can pull it open and find all the information. I think for most people that
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   would be the best way to do it because in general very rarely are many people worried
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   about people having access to their information and this is a good way to have all of it there.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.360]   It's just to have a drawer. I call it, it's kind of a cutesy name, but I call it the
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.320]   love drawer to make sure that you have everything stashed aside there so all the information
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.360]   is there. I would ask you if you do the physical paper method, I would ask you to try to make
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.160]   sure it's secure. Have at the very minimum a locking file cabinet if not putting it into
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.400]   a safe that's a little bit more secure. The risk of identity theft is very significant
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.560]   and when you study identity theft this may be changing now but very frequently the person
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.080]   who steals your identity is somebody who is known to you. It's often a family member or
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.360]   a friend, somebody who's known to you, sometimes a domestic servant that you've hired, a worker
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.280]   that's working on your house. If you have your paperwork, especially your important
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.640]   financial paperwork, easily accessible to somebody I think that's a risk that in my
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.880]   opinion could be easily overcome by simply using a safe and making sure things are stashed
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.320]   in the safe. So in that file cabinet you should make sure that you have information on all
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:21.000]   your bank accounts, information on all of your insurance policies, information on basically
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   where everything is, investment accounts, etc. Deeds to property, titles for vehicles,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.560]   etc. A good way to do it, what I prefer to do is I prefer to keep that actually as a
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:39.560]   mobile, I don't like to have it in a drawer with file folders, I keep it in a mobile kit,
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.920]   just a, you can use a couple different kinds of file wallets or varying, you know, a bag
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.720]   of different kinds. But I keep it as a mobile kit so that if we have to leave the house
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.200]   quickly I can just grab the important documents case out of the safe and we can hit the road
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.720]   and I have everything that I need right there. So that's one thing to consider is if you
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.920]   need to leave the house, if there's a house fire, forest fire, you know, family emergency,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.880]   something like that, can you just grab it and go. It's a little bit less useful to file
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:15.320]   things, but if you bring together having the important documents there with good digitization
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.640]   of things like statements and accounts and things like that, then you can largely minimize
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   the need for filing. You can keep this in a digital format as well. I personally think
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.800]   there's a good argument to be made for keeping multiple copies of basically a list of documents,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.920]   keeping them on, you know, movable flash media, USB thumb drive. I'd like it if those files
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.880]   were kept in an encrypted database, but make sure that your wife has the passwords and
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.200]   knows how to access that. What I do is I keep it on, I keep the data on some mini SD cards,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.240]   and so I have all the data and all the documents digitized in a document tree, and then I keep
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.960]   an encrypted container on an encrypted mini SD card, and then that little tiny thing,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.520]   have a couple backups of those that you update from time to time, and that little tiny thing
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.480]   is easy to grab and go, and it has everything that she would need with instructions of what
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.960]   to do if I die. So that's kind of some technical stuff. I think most people probably, I would
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.100]   like it if everyone were competent enough to do the encrypted digitization. It's probably
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.520]   unnecessary for most people, but for those of us who are more technically competent,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.400]   I think that's a good argument as well. The next thing I think is necessary is good instructions
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.520]   of a basic general layout of what you would do. So for example, I've tried to talk with
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.640]   my wife and say, "Okay, if I'm dead, here's what I recommend. Here's how much money you
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.080]   could expect to have, and here's what I think you should do with it." I try to make sure,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   "Here are people that you should call," and so to give her the people that she would call
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   on for advice. And so if you have a trusted financial planner or a friend who is trustworthy
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.240]   with money, if you have parents or people like that, make sure that she knows how to
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.360]   get good advice. Because if you're dead and your wife is dealing with the trauma of your
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.580]   death, it's unlikely that she's going to be in an emotionally stable situation. So the
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:15.320]   first thing that she needs is to know who to reach out to for counsel, somebody who
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.560]   is a little bit more dispassionate, not so emotionally involved in the stress of your
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.620]   loss, so that they can give her good counsel. Practically speaking, I think the first thing
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:32.120]   to do is to make sure that there is an immediate source of money and funds for your wife so
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:39.080]   that she can defer any kind of important decisions. The basic advice that most financial advisors
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:45.960]   would offer to a newly widowed woman or a newly widowed man is don't make any big decisions
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.840]   quickly. And he's going to need to take some time for you to understand what direction
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.960]   to move. It's going to take time for you to understand where you should go, what you should
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.180]   do. So don't sell the house, don't immediately downsize, all that. There are circumstances
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:06.480]   in which the financial circumstances are so dire that it's, you know, the circumstances
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.440]   can be so dire that things have to happen quickly. You know, the person has to make
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.920]   changes quickly because they just can't afford it. But let's not start there. And so I would
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   say number one, making sure that there's always plenty of money available that's immediately
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.580]   available. So this should refer immediately to emergency funds. Obviously, your wife should
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.640]   be able to get her hands on your family's emergency funds immediately, whether that's
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.240]   physical cash. I recommend that people have substantial amounts of physical cash in a
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.000]   place where it can be obtained fairly readily but securely stored in terms of bank accounts
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.640]   that are just set aside for emergency funds. And then access to lines of credit. I would
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.320]   say the most reliable one being credit cards, having a portfolio of credit cards available
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.480]   with high credit limits that your wife can use for expenditures if she has to pay for
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   bills, if she has to pay for medical expenses, etc. or for funeral costs, things like that.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.920]   Credit cards are going to be the most simple way for her to do that. Now I'm assuming here
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.000]   that you also are going to make sure that she has large amounts of money available because
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.440]   especially if she's not bringing income into the house, she needs to be protected either
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.320]   through your family's investments or through insurance, life insurance. And so as long
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.560]   as you have plenty of that, then it should be no big deal for her to have credit cards
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.900]   to handle the expenses. As long as she's not going to be financially destitute, then because
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.480]   you have insurance policies or because you have significant assets, then I think the
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   credit cards are the best move for her to be able to use that and emergency cash to
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.040]   cover expenses for a while so that she can take time to think and time to breathe. The
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.840]   reason why having the cash and the access to spending power available is because we
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.120]   don't know when you die. Do you die in the midst of a recession when the market is down
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.320]   30%? Did all of a sudden your real estate properties decline in value substantially?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.160]   And so making sure that you have some money so that she can take time to decide what she's
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:07.720]   going to do, take time to decide how to adjust the family's assets portfolio, etc. You need
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.760]   spending money for her to get her through from here to there. So those are some of the
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   practical things that I think of that I think solve many of the problems. I guess the only
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.080]   thing I could think of in addition would be making sure that there's no unresolved conflict,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.760]   making sure that you can die in peace so that without leaving unresolved conflict and hurt
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.200]   feelings and regrets and things like that. But those are my ideas, Andy.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   Great, thank you. Do you have any, is there any concern as far as like watching out for
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.880]   credit scores or other things like that besides, I mean I think you know past shows you've
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.080]   done and some of your courses I think are really good topics on those things, but is
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.040]   there anything besides making sure that there's money available and she knows how to access
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   it?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.520]   Well I think obviously credit, you need to make sure that credit is taken care of, that
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.640]   somebody's credit is protected. The simplest way to do that is just simply to have the
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.240]   credit open, the credit profiles open when you are going through any kind of financial
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.560]   changes that need to be made. If you're getting credit cards, getting mortgages, things like
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.480]   that. But once you pass through that stage of life or that phase of your finances, I
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.640]   think the best thing to do is to have all your credit profiles frozen so that nobody
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.040]   can have access to it. Now of course you need to make sure that you store the appropriate
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.920]   pin codes with your important data, that can't be lost. But it's best to just go ahead and
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   have credit profiles frozen all the time because if your credit profile is frozen, you've largely
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:47.880]   taken care of the need for, well you've largely eliminated the risk of theft as far as how
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.540]   it could impact your credit. Now if there were a more contentious situation, let's say
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:58.720]   that you were dying a slow death of cancer and your family is facing significant medical
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.600]   bills, then we might take a more thoughtful approach to how we structured the family debts,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.840]   the family finances, etc. Trying to think about what dies with you, etc. But in my mind
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.440]   a lot of that stuff is, I mean that's outside the scope of what you're talking about. If
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.360]   your wife is not earning an income that's measured in finance and money, then there's
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.680]   not going to be, the only limitation that's going to do for her is number one, that's
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   going to cause her to not be accumulating things like social security credits, but she
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.140]   can draw off of your social security profile. So that's not, I don't think that's worth
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.760]   it for her to work just to accumulate social security credits. But with regard to her credit,
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.560]   you do want to make sure that her credit score stays high. And so think through that. For
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.280]   example, there are strategic reasons why one of you would be on one debt, one of you would
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.560]   be on another debt, etc. But it's probably a good idea to make sure that her credit score
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.800]   is strong and you can do that regardless of her personal income. That doesn't matter,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   it's just a matter of if it's important to you to build a credit score for you and to
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.720]   maintain a credit score, then do that. Make sure it's the same way for both of you and
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.960]   then make sure that the risk of identity theft is very low. So those are my thoughts, Andy.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.120]   All right. Great. Thank you. Any other follow up questions or comments? I've got time for
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   another one if you got one. I have a totally different question, if you
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.200]   want a different question. Go ahead.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.160]   So the question, I guess, I see a lot of advice, kind of about emergency funds, I see a lot
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.400]   of advice from you and other people to kind of build up 10 to 100 to whatever significant
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.320]   amount of cash savings in a bank under your mattress, whatever, and then have that kind
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.840]   of an opportunity fund. And you make the comment, if you have $100,000, you can move anywhere
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.760]   in the world, you can quit and start a new job, you can make any decision. And I guess
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.840]   I would like to hear your thoughts on kind of how do you go about thinking that? Because
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.880]   if I save up $100,000, which I have not done yet, and then I decide to go make some $50,000
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.080]   change that reduces my income temporarily, I've very much curtailed that opportunity
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.680]   that I built for myself, if that makes sense. So how would you go about kind of deciding
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:28.520]   and not just sitting there and hoarding your money after you've accumulated money?
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.840]   Basically where that came from, from myself. So I was a personal finance aficionado for
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   many years. I always cared about money and I read a lot of personal financial advice.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:48.280]   And I didn't ever hear people talk about the lifestyle stuff. Most financial advice, especially
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:54.960]   at the simplistic level, there are certainly, I mean, I got to be careful because the world
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.480]   of authors is very broad and there are many people who've given excellent advice on all
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.720]   different topics. But the kinds of things that I read when I was first getting interested
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:12.520]   in personal finance focused on what I'll call just the stereotypical pattern of modern American
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:21.400]   life that you're going to get a job and you should save an emergency fund for your personal
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.960]   hospital, in case your car breaks down or you have a medical bill, and then you should
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.080]   fund your retirement account because retirement is the number one goal. That was largely what
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.200]   I consumed. And the challenge was that that was largely, even when I was working as a
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.120]   financial advisor, that was largely what I taught to other people. And looking back on
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.480]   it now, I'm embarrassed of how little hope I gave people about their personal freedom
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.600]   with regard to their saving money. And I could say again and again and again, I would have
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.520]   clients who would come in and sit in my office and they would be clients that would have
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.560]   a six-figure net worth, but most of their net worth was tied up in their 401k or in
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.320]   their house equity or something like that. And they didn't ever really have that spark
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:11.900]   of joy with regard to their wealth. They're in the top handful of percent of global wealth.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.440]   If we measure all the billions of people in the world, these people with a six-figure
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.280]   net worth are in the top handful. I don't know the exact statistic, but I would at least
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.320]   the top 10%, if not the top 5% of everybody in the world. And yet there's no real spark
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.160]   of enjoying that wealth. There's no real spark of freedom. There's no real sense of personal
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.320]   freedom or personal autonomy. So one of the things that was very influential on me was
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   when I finally came across the literature relating to the math of early retirement,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.400]   primarily through, for me, it was the first influence was Jacob Lund Fisker and his book
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.120]   Early Retirement Extreme that opened my eyes to how the math worked. I am a certified financial
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.480]   planner and I didn't know how the math, I couldn't make sense of how the math worked.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.280]   All of a sudden, that spark of freedom became tangible and that changed me because instead
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.360]   of a mindset of, "Oh, I have to work until I'm 65 years old," I realized, "Oh, if I make
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:17.400]   these other changes, I could work for 10 years." But along the way, I had my own unique journeys.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.520]   I got married, I have more children than most people in the personal finance space. I have
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.840]   more of a bent towards entrepreneurship. I'm not one of the models that you frequently
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.480]   hear of, of a single person living on $5,000 a year or a dual income, no kids couple. I
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   have more responsibilities. Yet, what I realized is as I started to accumulate more money,
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.160]   especially money that was outside of retirement accounts, I realized that my life choices
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:52.600]   opened up to me. As a father and a leader of my family, when I first had $100,000 available
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.920]   to me in cash, I realized that I didn't have a dream that I couldn't figure out a way to
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.880]   finance with that amount of money. That was very different than when it was all locked
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.800]   away in retirement accounts and I couldn't touch it, or at least I thought I couldn't
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.920]   touch it because I was drilled with the dogma of don't drain your retirement accounts, don't
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:20.200]   use your retirement accounts. In terms of a personal freedom, I realized, no, I'm not
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:28.000]   financially independent as measured by being able to live off of the income from my investments.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.700]   But I am financially independent in the sense that there's almost nothing I can dream of
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.720]   doing except stopping working and just quitting and not working ever again the rest of my
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.120]   life, which I don't dream of doing. I realized there's almost nothing that I can't dream
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:47.760]   of doing that I can't achieve. It made me protect my cash a lot more than I ever did
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.120]   before. Then in reflection, I realized that it could be achieved with a much lower amount
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.560]   of money. That's where my $1,000, $10,000, $100,000 comes from. They're just round numbers.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.360]   There's nothing scientific about it. Just to recognize that even on as little as $10,000,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.880]   a single person and maybe a married couple, it's hard once you start having the financial
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.400]   responsibility of children, $10,000 feels a little bit light. But of course, there are
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.320]   millions of families that don't have that, that raise their children effectively. But
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.440]   you can change in life. You're no longer worrying about how do I make my first, last and security
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.300]   deposit to rent a new house. You're no longer worrying about can I afford to buy a house
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.740]   because I don't have a down payment. Once you reach that six-figure level of cash, you
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:38.140]   can do those things. Then other examples would be starting a business. There are very few
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.980]   businesses that couldn't be started with $100,000. Now, you might need more money than that,
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.420]   but $100,000 could be your down payment or $100,000 could be your living expenses for
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:54.500]   the first two years until you become profitable. $100,000 in debt-freeness leads you to a place
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:02.340]   of a very, very high level of freedom. And yet that's achievable by almost any person
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.220]   within a very reasonable amount of time, a couple of years, whether that means you sell
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:13.540]   your house and you move into a semi-truck and you live in a semi-truck where you become
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.860]   an over-the-road trucker, that's available to almost anybody without large amounts of
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.680]   education, without large amounts of credentialization. And you could save $100,000 in two years of
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.060]   doing that. Whether it means you and your family, maybe you have a family, you move
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:34.440]   in and you take a job being a superintendent of a 30-unit apartment building and you live
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.140]   on nothing, get your free rent because you're the superintendent and save all your money.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.180]   You can save $50,000, $100,000 in a couple of years. And then you can pivot almost any
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.760]   direction. So what's the best thing to do once you're there? Is the best thing to do
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:55.020]   to just drain your bank account and spend it? No, probably not. In fact, I'm very loathe
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.900]   to ever lose the flexibility. In my credit card course, I even teach this, that one of
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.740]   the worst places to be when you're in credit card debt is to be in credit card debt and
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.860]   have no money. If you have credit card debt but you have money also, credit card debt
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.980]   is not really that big of a deal. In that course, I go through some of the strategies
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:17.020]   where if you have $100,000 in the bank and you have $100,000 of credit card debt, you
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.620]   can pay off the credit card debt any day you want. And then thus raising your credit score,
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.820]   you can apply from, you have options. Now, that would be unusual why anyone would do
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.860]   that. But when you have cash, you have options. You can lower your debt temporarily to enhance
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.460]   your credit profile in some way, and then you can raise it back up and restore your
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.820]   cash. So how you work with it, I mean, I can answer some of the specific questions, but
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.740]   how you work with it is up to you. But that's basically your funding capital, it's your
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.660]   seed corn that you never really want to get rid of. But with that seed corn and a little
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:54.860]   bit of thoughtful, creative approaches, again, give me the business, give me the real estate,
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.580]   give me anything that you're trying to do, and I think with that we can have enough to
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:04.320]   get you there. And along the way, while you're working towards the ultimate expression of
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.980]   financial independence, which of course is being able to live on the income from your
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:14.060]   investments in comfort, we can experience the joy and the freedom of having independence
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.140]   of choice, not being stuck, not being stuck at a job we're not well suited for, not being
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.540]   stuck in a neighborhood that we don't want to live in. So that's my answer to you, Andy.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.460]   If you have a more specific question about how to actually use it, maybe in your situation,
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:34.020]   I can help you with that too. But yes, my experience has been that it has opened up
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.180]   the world to me.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:45.340]   Cool. Yeah, I think maybe I should have phrased that as, do you think that saving $100,000
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:52.820]   cash is a better thing to do before pursuing a business or a lifestyle thing? So in my
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:59.660]   personal example, I haven't had less than $10,000 cash available basically since a few
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.300]   months after I started working full time. And I've fluctuated, but I've never really
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.140]   gone above about $30,000. And then we bought a rental house and sunk a lot of money into
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:16.660]   repairing that. We're right now trying to buy an arm that we want to live on. And it
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:23.620]   comes up, and then we do have that freedom from having cash available. And then we use
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.340]   that to go do something. And I guess I'm curious about the counterfactual. I have not pursued
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:36.420]   that extreme move into a truck and do something kind of extreme for a couple of years to get
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.220]   a bunch of cash and then move on. And just sort of curious, I guess, if you could comment
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:48.500]   on do you think that is a better way or worse way? Or should I prioritize more towards blowing
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:54.860]   up a bunch of cash or just kind of continue making what so far seem to be good and successful
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:00.220]   choices in lifestyle and business?
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:06.380]   Based on what you're saying, no. I don't think there's any reason why you should change what
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.980]   you're doing just to build up $100,000 of cash. And I doubt that there would be any
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:18.260]   one specific thing that would cause you to, that would cause your life to be dramatically
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.660]   different if you did indeed accumulate that level of savings. The person, there are a
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:29.020]   couple of people that I'm trying to reach with my message about even those examples
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:34.920]   that I gave. First, Andy, your experience of never having had less than $10,000 since
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:43.220]   you started working is not the common experience either of anybody in the world or of most
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.140]   US Americans. Most people don't save any money no matter how long they've been working. The
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.180]   few people who do save some money usually don't do so intentionally and there's just
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.460]   a relatively small percentage of the population that actually does have significant savings
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.180]   and you're in that percentage. It's not that hard to do but it's a different mindset than
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.460]   most people have. And so you were blessed from an early age to have a wealth building
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.420]   mindset and that's clearly served you well. But most people aren't there. And so what
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:21.100]   I'm trying to do with my message of save $1,000, save $10,000 is to try to get people who are
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:26.940]   adults earning adult incomes to recognize there's no reason why a half to two-thirds
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.140]   of the US American population shouldn't be able to put their hands, can't put their
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:37.100]   hands on $1,000 if they need it. That's ridiculous. It may not be ridiculous if we're working
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.820]   in Zimbabwe but it's ridiculous in the United States of America. And so by giving a very
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.780]   feasible goal, my hope is to inspire them. Then with $100,000, my hope is to help people
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:54.180]   who are basically working in jobs that they may not have chosen all that intentionally,
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.900]   may not be all that thrilled about, may not be all that well suited to, who are putting
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:03.180]   most of their money into retirement accounts which are viewed as sacrosanct, who are not
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.500]   experiencing the level of personal freedom. They're not experiencing freedom of their
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.420]   choices. They're stressed about money. They often don't feel like they can do anything.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.980]   They don't think they can afford to change jobs. They don't think they can afford to
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.820]   start a business. And my hope is to say, yes, you can. You can do it. You just need to have
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.060]   some money and then work your way through it. Now, if you're already pursuing that,
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.100]   you're buying rental properties, you're moving to a farm, etc., no, I don't see any reason
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:33.000]   for you to stop that because the point of the $100,000 is that it can buy you freedom.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.220]   So should you stop with $30,000 and just never save cash again? No, of course not. You should
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.580]   continue to build up cash. But if you see an opportunity, something that's going to
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:48.180]   be a free choice, something that's going to move you in the direction of your vision for
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.020]   what you think would serve you and your family better, then I think you move on it as quickly
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:58.140]   as you can comfortably do so. What I would do is I would just make sure that I did everything
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.060]   possible to not lose my cash. I would just want to make sure that I didn't get into a
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.100]   bind where my back's up against the wall where I'm going to lose my cash. So if I had $30,000
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.420]   of cash and I wanted to move on to a farm, but I had to use the $30,000 of cash to put
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.460]   as a down payment to buy land, I wouldn't do that. I would lease land because I want
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.220]   the $30,000 in cash so I can get the business going because I'm not going to lose my freedom.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.700]   I'm not going to lose my ability to pivot and change. For me, especially being a father,
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.140]   that has been the number one thing for me is I've recognized that I can start things,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.820]   they can fail. My businesses can fail, my investments can fail, but as long as I keep
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.340]   some cash on hand and as long as I have the ability to work, then I can always provide
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:50.140]   for my family even if my businesses fail and we're not going to be sleeping on the streets.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.340]   That wasn't as important to me a decade ago as it is today. So I guess for me, it's built
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:00.300]   that security. But I wouldn't change and I wouldn't say no to a good opportunity just
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.860]   because I've got to have $100,000 in the bank, but I would just keep working towards healthy
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:14.540]   amounts of cash. My pleasure. Any other questions or comments, Andy?
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.180]   Andy Wertheimer I actually have a whole list of questions
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.740]   I've been building up. I thought I was going to have a full call of callers, but every
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.220]   time a caller jumps on, they just drop off all of a sudden. So right now, it's still
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.460]   you and me. So go ahead.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:38.820]   All right. So this again would be kind of towards your philosophy on wealth building.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.940]   I was listening to your show on, I don't remember the title of it, but when you did a month
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:50.820]   or two ago about not retiring and not needing to retire. And you know, I'm talking about
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:57.260]   it, but you've talked about that idea a lot. And yet still prioritizing building wealth.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:03.340]   And at the same time, I see you from my very limited vantage point, you seem to be pursuing
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:10.380]   a lot of other non-traditional goals, such as having a larger than average family, your
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:16.620]   wife being able to stay home and focus on the children, international travel, things
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:25.100]   like that, that probably reduce your ability to just grow wealthy. And so I kind of come
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.500]   from the aspect of, I guess I want to be wealthy, like who wouldn't want to be wealthy, but
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.740]   I don't feel like necessarily my wife shares that. And it's hard for me to articulate
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:44.380]   if I don't want to ever stop working, why would I be making these choices that pamper
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.780]   today and tomorrow and 10 years from now in order to be wealthy, you know, 20, 30 years
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.340]   from now, instead of just focusing on more, I mean, I have lots of non-traditional interests.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:01.020]   I'm interested in privacy stuff. I'm interested in eco-friendly stuff. I'm interested in parenting
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:07.820]   stuff, like, and all of those to be outside the norm costs money. And I'd like to hear
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.340]   kind of your ideas on how you reconcile those things, if that makes sense of the question.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:23.060]   So in my mind, there are a couple of, here's my personal philosophy on it. So first, I
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:33.300]   think there are a number of significant and serious risks of focusing on wealth and financial
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:40.420]   wealth, being rich, as a primary goal. Now this is driven for me primarily out of my
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   religious ideology that is a controlling influence in my life. But there are a number of very
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:54.660]   serious warnings in the Bible about the desire for wealth. Jesus said, "Woe to those of you
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:04.280]   who are rich in this age, for it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.880]   than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven." There are repeated biblical admonitions
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:19.780]   and warnings against pursuing wealth, against desiring to be rich as a primary thing. There
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:28.540]   are also a lot of biblical instructions about wealth being a virtuous thing. There are many
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:35.220]   proverbs, you know, "A virtuous man leaves an inheritance to his children's children.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.020]   A righteous man leaves an inheritance to his children's children. And the wealth of the
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.900]   sinner is stored up for the righteous." So some people, of course, would say, "Well,
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.980]   these are contradictory. Why should we give any thought to it?" Well, I don't take that
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:55.220]   viewpoint. I say there is something here that maybe it appears self-contradictory in the
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.980]   first moment, but there are truths here. And the way that I've understood those truths
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.820]   and the way that I've reconciled those truths could be encapsulated in the idea that money
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.700]   makes a wonderful servant but a terrible master. So I want to guard my heart against wanting
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   to be rich against all odds. I want to guard my heart against pursuing the allure of wealth,
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:25.620]   because I can recognize and see in my own life and in the lives of many people all around
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:32.700]   us, of course, that when money becomes the number one goal, it has a destructive effect
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:40.280]   on other things. An example of this that comes to me. There's a writer who I like and admire.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.300]   His name is Mark Ford. He wrote for years under the pen name of Michael Masterson. He's
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:50.460]   written a number of books. He's written a number of books, even on finance, that are
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.000]   quite excellent. I'm struggling for the names. I think one was called Wealth for Grads or
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.180]   something like that. But if you look up Michael Masterson, his books on money were pretty
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.620]   good. He wrote one called Seven Years to Seven Figures, which I thought was excellent. I
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.820]   had a domain name registered at that for a long time, because I thought it was so good.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.460]   And he interviewed people who had set out and were able to become millionaires over
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:19.220]   a seven-year period of time. So Michael Masterson reports in his personal writings about his
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:27.000]   own experience. He writes about how he decided at an early age that his number one goal was
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.300]   to become wealthy. He was attending a Dale Carnegie seminar, and the instructor at the
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.700]   Dale Carnegie seminar said, "You've got to decide what your number one goal is." He didn't
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.220]   really know what it should be, but he decided, "I'm going to become wealthy." And so he went
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.820]   on to become very, very wealthy. But in his later years, he has written, I think he's
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.900]   in his late 60s now, something like that. But in his later years, he's written about
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:54.800]   how although he was very successful with that goal, he became very wealthy. He doesn't think
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.820]   at this point that it was good, because it cost him some significant relationships, it
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.940]   cost him a number of trials. There were just things about it that weren't good about that.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:11.180]   So he doesn't write a lot about that. But in that, I'm taking just from his public writing,
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   that sense of regret that when you make money, you're master. When you make money, you're
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:19.220]   number one goal, you miss out. And I think most of us in our lives could see this. For
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:25.980]   example, if I make money my number one goal, and over the past few months, I have been
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:32.580]   more frustrated with my family than I've ever been, because I feel like I can't do the things
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:38.620]   that I want to do that would make my business flourish to the degree it's capable of flourishing,
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.940]   that would allow me to experience the professional success that I would like to experience. It's
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.700]   been tough. Even just finding a time that is quiet enough for me to record a Q&A call
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.380]   has been really tough, really challenging. And I feel constantly hamstrung by the obligations
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:00.740]   of my young children, and it causes me to not be experiencing as much professional success
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:06.020]   as I'm capable of. And I look at that, and I look around, and I think, "Man, this would
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.220]   be a whole lot easier if I were single. This would be a whole lot easier if I didn't have
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:15.980]   children. I just think we could come and go. I would have no problems whatsoever." But
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.420]   it's in those moments that I remind myself that those aren't my goals. That's not my
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.900]   life. That's not what I've set out. I've not set out to pursue wealth and financial independence
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.660]   and professional success as my number one goal. And so because of that, I have damage
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.940]   to my wealth, my financial wealth. I have damage to my professional success because
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.980]   my goals are more encapsulated, broader than that. But when I look at the wealth of my
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:48.340]   children and I look at the lives of older people, I have known a number of very rich,
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:54.560]   very lonely, very miserable, very unfulfilled old people. And I have noticed that there
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:02.260]   is a high correlation between personal satisfaction and happiness, between the quality of one's
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.420]   family as compared to the size of one's bank account. It's not to say that those who are
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:13.040]   childless or who are unmarried can't be happy. Of course not. But when I think about me lying
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.700]   on my deathbed and I reflect back, I don't wish to have the biggest bank account. I wish
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:26.300]   to have a very rich life. So it starts with presuppositional philosophy. Now, I believe
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:34.140]   that wealth is a natural result of a life of integrity and wise decisions. I believe
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:39.940]   that wealth is a natural result of a virtuous life. It's not a guaranteed result. For example,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:45.340]   somebody could come and steal your wealth anytime, whatever the nature of that thief
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:52.340]   is, we don't know. But a virtuous person, I believe, in time should accumulate wealth.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.780]   And the only offsetting factor would be if they consciously chose to give away all of
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.340]   their money along the way, which I have known a number of people that do that. They don't
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.500]   have any money to their name, but they're very people of deep virtue and deep integrity
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.140]   who have simply chosen throughout their life to give away all of their money whenever it
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:16.100]   came into their hands. And the reason I say that is because there are virtues and personal
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:22.660]   character qualities that I think naturally lead to wealth. So things like industriousness,
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.100]   being hardworking, being industrious, for me, that's a biblical character trait. It's
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.060]   something that's mandatory for Christians to be industrious, hardworking people. It
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.220]   embarrasses me when I see people who are not that way, who proclaim the same God that I
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.380]   proclaim, but I want to encourage people to be hardworking and industrious. Well, in a
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:48.260]   free society, in general, people who are hardworking and who are industrious wind up doing more,
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.120]   and they wind up experiencing the benefits of flourishing businesses or of higher wages
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.460]   because of their higher productivity. I think when you bring the concept of being a servant
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:04.700]   into it, then it becomes even clearer in terms of the success that I would expect somebody
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.980]   who was an effective servant to experience. Jesus taught that he who would be greatest
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:16.580]   among you must be the servant of all. And so the basic ethic, one of the basic ethics
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:24.100]   is service. The one who serves the most effectively, the one who serves the best, serves the most,
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:30.020]   is the one who ultimately receives the most rewards. It's not from coming down from the
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.660]   top down trying to extract, trying to force someone and stick a gun in their ribs and
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.780]   say, "Give me, give me, give me, give me your money." You can go out on the street and put
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.060]   your gun in someone's ribs and say, "Give me your money." You'll get a little bit of
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:47.340]   money, but you'll get far more if you go out and say, "Here, how can I serve you so that
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:54.260]   you'll be happy to give me your money?" And so the ethic of service applies in the workplace.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.360]   The person who serves their boss most effectively is the one who is very likely to be promoted.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.580]   And if you're not promoted above your boss, you'll be at least promoted alongside with
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.300]   your boss, so you'll come up through the ranks. The one, if you're in a company, of course,
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.260]   you serve your clients, your customers. And so the company that serves their clients and
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.820]   their customers most effectively is the company that's ultimately going to experience the
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:22.140]   most success, experience the most income. And if you add this income to caring for the
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:27.100]   bottom line and making sure that you're profitable, then you should be ultimately the most effective,
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.140]   the most profitable. The biggest and best companies in the long run are always going
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:37.580]   to be the ones who serve their customers the most effectively and who do it on a broad
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.540]   basis. People will tell others about them. So it's the ethic of service, not the ethic
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:48.020]   of coercion, but service that should guide my thinking. And anything that I do, then
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.620]   if I serve effectively, serve more effectively and serve more people more effectively, then
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   ultimately that should come in with the highest level of compensation, of remuneration. And
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.500]   then of course you could add in other important ethics, like the ethic of stewardship. Now
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.700]   we can talk about stewardship from a financial perspective, but even just stewardship of
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.020]   the resources that you're given. One of the most important Christian ethics is just stewardship
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.700]   over what you've given. So if that's your stewardship over your body, stewardship over
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.420]   your money, stewardship over your house, stewardship over your property. So if you think about
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:26.620]   this, you mentioned farming. So let's use an example of something like farming. It's
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:33.300]   not okay to come in and rape the land and destroy it and strip it of all of its nutrients,
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.740]   everything out of it, just so you can make a quick buck. That might work. You might make
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.380]   a quick buck, but you're not going to achieve lasting wealth the same way as if you come
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:47.580]   in and you steward the land and you take care of it and you build it and you invest into
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:54.420]   it. The farmer who comes in and invests into his land and doesn't destroy it, but who cares
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:01.180]   for it and who cultivates it is going to be established for their long-term, dare I say
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:06.980]   it, financial security for their entire lifetime, if they care for the resources that are there.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:12.300]   So whether that's caring for your land, caring for the animals, caring for the water, whatever
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.740]   it is that you have, you have to demonstrate that ethic of stewardship and care over the
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.940]   resources that you have control over. You can't go and tell someone else what they should
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:25.580]   do with their resources until we first demonstrate that we're being effective with the resources
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:32.020]   that you have. And I think this is reflected in almost anything. I've been convicted in
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.820]   the past about something silly like washing my car. I didn't used to care how dirty my
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:41.660]   car was and I realized, no, this is valuable. This is an important component of my stewardship.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.900]   I need to take care of my car. Yes, I've always taken care of it mechanically, but I need
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.740]   to also just make sure that I care for this car. Does my house reflect the ethic of stewardship?
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.940]   When I first bought a house, I didn't care so much. But now I've realized, no, this is
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:01.540]   a reflection of the kind of steward that I am. Well, what happens if I'm going to go
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.380]   and rent from an apartment? A guy I know, very wealthy guy, rents a lot of apartments.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.780]   The first thing that he does when he has somebody who comes and wants to rent an apartment from
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.820]   him is he goes and he inspects their car and he looks in their car to see how they're caring
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:20.380]   for their car. The second thing that he does is he always manufactures some kind of excuse
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.580]   for him to go and see their house, see them at their current place of address. Oh, some
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:30.260]   paperwork, some signature, et cetera. So that way he can see how is this person caring for
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.380]   their car and for the house that they're currently renting. And if the person is not being a
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.100]   good steward of those resources, he's not going to rent to them. And now he gives good
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.780]   apartments at good rates, et cetera, but he's not going to rent to them because they're
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.940]   not a good steward. So if I'm being a good steward of the resources that I have, I'm
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   caring for my body, I'm caring for my car, I'm caring for my property, it looks like
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:57.060]   I take pride. It doesn't look like a redneck shack. Then that's going to reflect and it's
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:02.260]   going to be reflected throughout my life. Things like that, these ethics matter. And
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:09.220]   I see no reason why in a free society that the people who most model these ethics shouldn't
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:15.540]   be experiencing the most success in its fullest sense of meaning. Now, these are virtues,
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   these are character traits. But let's flip the coin and study the obverse. Now, what's
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:28.780]   the opposite of honesty? Dishonesty. Well, if I cultivate dishonesty, if I cultivate
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:35.060]   a sense of, if I lie to everybody, if I'm known as a charlatan and a fraud, is that
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:41.260]   going to lead to success? Clearly not. Maybe in the short term, again, I can run a Ponzi
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:46.780]   scheme, but in the long term, it doesn't. It prospers for a short time, but in the long
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:53.780]   term it never does. So integrity matters, honesty matters, truthfulness matters. What's
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:48:00.560]   the opposite of industriousness? Laziness. Well, what kind of, who's going to pay a lot
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.140]   of money to somebody who is lazy? Who's going to pay a lot of money to somebody who is,
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.180]   shirks their work, who doesn't just roll in their sleeves and get things done? What's
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:17.100]   the opposite of frugality? Well, profligacy. Does anybody want to hire somebody who's profligate
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:22.660]   with their money? Am I really going to be offered a job as the vice president of a company
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.620]   because I'm known as being bad with my money? The way that I handle my money is going to
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.540]   reflect on how I handle my boss's money. And so frugality is going to be extremely valuable
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:38.900]   as a virtue, but no one's going to promote me or advance me because I'm a spendthrift,
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:45.180]   because I'm wasteful, I'm extravagant. What's the opposite of stewardship? Destruction.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.100]   Should I really be destroying something? Somebody comes by and sees that my car is destroyed,
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.660]   my house is destroyed, my land has been destroyed, I've raped the physical resources that I had
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:01.020]   to start with, I'm obese, I don't care for my body, I don't care for my animals. None
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.260]   of these things are character qualities that are going to lead to success and advancement.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:10.300]   Frugality is a virtue. It's something that is a character trait and a character quality
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.940]   that I wish to cultivate in myself and I wish to cultivate in my children. Well, if you
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:21.480]   combine hardworking, industriousness with frugality, there should be a surplus of money.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.300]   You have income, you have low expenses, so now there should be a surplus of money. What
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.920]   do you do with that? Well, another virtue that I wish to develop in myself and in my
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:36.580]   children and to teach to others is the virtue of looking for how do you invest wisely. There
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.940]   are many, many scriptural instructions, which again is where I draw my ideology from, which
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.580]   we're talking about wise investments. And then things like soliciting counsel, so wise
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:52.940]   investments would involve involving others. So I need to develop a board of advisors,
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.800]   people to help me to make sure that I'm investing money wisely. Well, it makes all the sense
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:03.540]   in the world to me that if somebody is hardworking and industrious and they're frugal, they should
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.660]   have money. And if they're pursuing wise counsel on how to invest their money, they should
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:13.700]   start to make proper investments. And then in time, as that cycle is repeated year after
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:18.100]   year after year, wealth should be the natural result. And there are all kinds of ways where
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.580]   I believe that should be enhanced by the development of personal virtue. Honesty, if you become
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:28.980]   an honest person and are known as somebody who is an honest person, then in time that
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:35.040]   has certain results. You start to be trusted with larger projects. You start to be entrusted
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.860]   with larger sums of money. You start to be trusted with personal information. Generosity,
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:46.340]   becoming a generous person, one who is continually giving to others of your time, of your talents,
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:52.860]   of your money, somebody who is generous generally will tend to develop relationships in their
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.700]   local community and will generally have other people who are looking to help them. And that
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:04.880]   generosity, even under the law of reciprocity, that generosity will usually be returned by
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.340]   other people. So now if you're known as a generous person, other people often tend to
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.520]   reciprocate and be generous towards you. And as you start to work and to labor in the lives
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.400]   of others to help other people succeed, well, many times people want to see you succeed.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.600]   So you might get the phone call about the good job or you might get the phone call about
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.980]   so-and-so is selling his farm, etc. And then by being an honest person, the friction of
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:31.620]   your investment activities can be diminished. If you need money and you're known as an honest
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.340]   person who is not a thief, you can call up somebody who has more money and say, "Listen,
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:40.440]   I've got a deal over here to buy this farm and I need money. Will you please lend me
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:45.460]   money?" And that person will say, "Yes." And you don't have to go through all of the systems
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.760]   that are necessarily built for people to try to figure out who's honest and who's not honest.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.660]   If you've cultivated these personal virtues and characters, then they have a multiplying
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.640]   effect throughout your life. And so now you can say to somebody, "I need money. I can't
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.380]   tell you what it's for." And they'll say, "I trust you. Your word is your bond. You're
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.260]   a man who stands good. You're not a thief. You're a man who will pay back." And that
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:08.940]   person will give you money. It's happened to me. Been there, done that. It happens the
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:14.500]   same thing with employment. When I was in college, when I came back from Central America
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.940]   in college, I dropped out of school and I didn't have a job. I picked up the phone and
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.580]   I started calling former bosses of mine. The first boss I called, I said, "Hey, I need
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:26.020]   a work. Will you hire me?" He said, "Yes." And gave me a job. And to this day, I believe
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:31.400]   that at every single job I've ever had in my life, save one that ended badly, at every
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.140]   single job save one, I could call any of my former bosses and get a job today. Well, that's
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.980]   not... I don't say that to toot my own horn, just to say that that's something I can prove,
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:44.820]   that if you're hardworking, if you're honest, if you're a man of character and virtue, then
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:52.140]   you can develop these strings of benefits and privileges behind you that start to insulate
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:57.060]   you. Now, extrapolate that out over years, wealth should be the natural result. So I
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:05.780]   expect throughout my lifetime to become increasingly wealthy, financially wealthy, wealth in relationships,
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:10.380]   wealthy in experiences, wealth in time, etc. I expect that to continue throughout my entire
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.740]   lifetime. Now, it's possible that a different plan might be ordained for me. It's possible
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:21.540]   that everything will be taken from me. That's happened to many wealthy, virtuous people
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.300]   where everything has been stolen from them. Okay, if that happens, that happens. I'm not
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.620]   going to worry about it. It's possible that I could be called upon to give everything
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.460]   away. That's happened to many people that I've respected who have become very wealthy
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:39.140]   and the Lord has told them, "Give it all away." Fine, I'm okay with that. But for those reasons,
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:47.420]   I see that if you develop virtue, if you develop character, and if you develop those qualities
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:54.260]   that lead to successful relationships, etc., then there shouldn't be any reason, barring
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.060]   some of those extenuating circumstances that we can't control, there shouldn't be any reason
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.860]   not to become increasingly wealthy throughout your lifetime. And then if you cultivate the
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:08.140]   next generation of your children, of communities, etc., and you consistently invest in your
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.780]   children, you invest in your community, you invest in your friends, then now there are
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:17.500]   many more opportunities. And so, it doesn't have to be an either/or. It doesn't have to
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:24.000]   be one or the other. It's just in moderation. I'm not going to let my personal hobby consume
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.380]   all my money, because if I spend all my money on my personal hobby, then I'm not going to
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   have these other benefits. But I think in most things, even that you're talking about,
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.300]   there are ways in which you can wisely invest and spend money on the things that are important
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:43.940]   to you, and do it without harming your overall wealth accumulation. So, that's my philosophy.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.300]   Andy, did that answer the question? Any follow-up questions?
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:54.240]   Thanks. I think that's good. I kind of would have guessed that that was about where your
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.080]   philosophy was, but I didn't feel like you'd ever fully lay it out. So, thank you. I appreciate
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:05.000]   that. And I guess as a word of encouragement, I can't speak for any other listeners, but
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.680]   I know for myself, it is evident to me that you are prioritizing things that you value
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:17.480]   more than being rich, as far as family and things, and that that does interfere with
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   business growth, and that you choose to continue focusing on what you value. And that, to me,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:29.000]   is something that I admire about you, and one of the things that makes me want to support
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.600]   you and listen to your advice. So, I don't know if you hear that encouragement often,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.060]   but hopefully you hear that from me at least.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:42.340]   I appreciate it. It's certainly been something that I have wrestled with, because even today,
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:49.940]   I'm sitting here wrestling with… I just think… You look at it and I certainly do
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.580]   struggle with how do I do this. And at the end of the day, the thing that I always look
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:56:00.980]   at is maybe it's not good for my bank account, but I always just think about what am I going
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:07.500]   to be more satisfied with on my deathbed. Am I going to be satisfied because I have
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:13.980]   an extra zero… Sorry, an extra comma or a couple of extra commas on my net worth statement,
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:20.100]   or am I going to be satisfied because of the impact that I was able to have on the lives
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.660]   of a few people that I love and the lives of a few people in my local community. And
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:33.860]   to me, when we start with the end in mind and we recognize that at the end of our life,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:38.180]   when we reflect back from that place on our deathbed, you read the books. There are a
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:43.220]   lot of interesting sociologists who've gone and who've interviewed old people and people
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:49.800]   in their deathbed, etc. It's crystal clear that money is never the number one thought
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:56.380]   that anybody has. And so why would any of us be so foolish as to prioritize money and
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.540]   personal riches over those other things that are important? And then I imagine myself standing
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:07.740]   before the Lord and saying, "Give an account of yourself." It's very hard for me to,
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:14.660]   in that circumstance, say, "Well, I didn't say what I felt needed to be said because
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:18.740]   I thought it would hurt my wealth," or "I didn't say what I felt needed to be said,"
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.500]   or "I didn't go and love that person or encourage that person or give to this thing
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:28.180]   over here because I wouldn't have enough money." It's very hard for me to want to
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:35.220]   stand before Christ and say that. So I think we can all, I think most of us, regardless
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:40.660]   of if you share my background, I think most of us, when reflecting on it, would recognize
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:46.500]   that to be the case. But in order to be there, it's a lot easier to say that when you have
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.820]   money. There's a proverb that, I can't quote it perfectly, but that I've always
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:58:03.220]   liked, that basically, "Lord, may I neither be poor lest I steal, nor rich lest I forget."
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:08.740]   Anyway, being poor and being very poor and being very rich are both really difficult.
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:13.480]   And so I think most of us are blessed to be in that middle range where we don't want
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:19.140]   for anything, we're not worried about anything, we have no personal concern. If the tire blows
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:23.860]   up, it's not a big deal. And that allows us to have that more long-range perspective.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.420]   It's a lot harder for those who are living on the poverty line to have that long-range
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   perspective.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:36.020]   >> Andy Winkler Yeah, I like that proverb as well. I also
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.580]   can't quote it, but I've always appreciated that one.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.780]   >> Dave All right, I got time for one more. If you
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.080]   got any more, Andy, otherwise I'll wrap it up here. Any other questions or comments to
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   round us out?
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.520]   >> Andy Winkler All right, yep, I'll give you one last one.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.480]   So I have taken your career and income course, which I would definitely recommend to other
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:59:00.000]   listeners. I will admit I have not followed the advice super well yet, but I feel like
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.320]   I've been focusing on other things. One thing that I don't feel like maybe was addressed
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.560]   in there that probably is something specific to me and I've never really heard anybody
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:18.680]   talk about is I don't feel like I personally am a leader, an entrepreneur, not to say that
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:24.320]   I can't do those things, but I don't think that I am the type of person, and there's
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.440]   any evidence in my life, particularly that I'm the sort of person that wants to run out
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:34.160]   and start my own business and be the commanding, in charge, do it this way, start the business
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:41.480]   kind of person. But I do feel like I've seen throughout my life that I am a very good supporter.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:49.800]   If I have a boss that I understand and can get behind and push or even just a small job
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.240]   helping and volunteering something, I feel like I do a much better job as kind of the
[00:59:53.240 --> 01:00:00.680]   number two guy than the number one guy or the number one million guy. And I'm curious
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:11.120]   if you have any thoughts on how to even identify where you could find that sort of job where
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.200]   you're, I guess, the medium fish in a small pond. A lot of the resources I was saying,
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.040]   you're a good example of someone who has gone out and built a business and is not hiring.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.240]   I can't come, "Oh, I'll just go work for Joshua and he'd be the sort of person I'd
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.680]   want to work for," because it seems like most of the people I read about and hear about
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:35.720]   that do that sort of thing are entrepreneurs, want to do their own thing, don't want large
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:43.040]   organizations or medium-sized organizations. Does that make sense?
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:51.000]   It does. I'm not sure that I'm best suited to be in the number one slot either. And I
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.920]   think, I can't remember if I put it into the outline for the career and income course or
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:03.360]   not where I talked about being a number two. But I think being a number two guy is a wonderful
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:11.120]   strategy for success. I think it's a fantastic strategy for success and it can be very rewarding.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:18.040]   It can be much less stressful than being out in front. It can be very remunerative. It's
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.440]   really, really wonderful. I think there are a lot, it's an unsung benefit to being the
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:31.640]   number two guy. And I think that it's something that many of us would be wise to recognize
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:38.160]   and just simply pursue being somebody who is alongside of one of those people who has
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.200]   that kind of push for leadership versus not. I'll tell you just a short story because you
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:54.160]   talk about coming along with supporting a business, etc. There is a well-known, very
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:02.080]   popular personal finance personality who was in this space long before I was, who I really
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:10.760]   like, I respect, and I get along with very well in terms of philosophy of money, etc.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:22.480]   And I didn't really have any personal problems with him. He's free-thinking enough to embrace
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.120]   some of the things that I embrace, etc. And I talked to him even before I started Radical
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.680]   Personal Finance, right at the very beginning. And he offered me a job to work with him as
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.720]   a quasi-partner. We didn't spell out any details of exactly how we were going to work
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.480]   together, but basically he said, "Listen, come and work with me. I've got this large
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.640]   established brand. I've got all this infrastructure in place. I've got all these readers. I've
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.760]   got all these listeners. I've got all these people who are calling me. You and I could
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:03:01.640]   go far together. We have skills that are compatible, etc. And we could go a long way together."
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.960]   And I very, very seriously considered it. And to this day, I'm not sure whether I should
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.920]   have told him no, which was eventually what I told him no. But basically what happened
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:19.080]   is I thought it through and I realized that if I was going to go through the very excruciatingly
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:26.920]   expensive and difficult decision to walk away from the business that I had already built
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:35.000]   that was going to provide me, that was, you know, in order to gain something that was
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.240]   more free, I wasn't going to be content with a halfway level of freedom. And the biggest
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:48.960]   thing for me was having to censor what I thought about certain subjects. When you are working
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.800]   for somebody, you owe your boss a duty to either support them and to censor your own
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.920]   opinions that don't align with the duty of, or with the overall structure of the company,
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:09.160]   or you owe it to them to leave. It's very hard for me to see how it's right for you
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:18.240]   to be disloyal to your boss, to your company, and to publicly say things that would be in
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.480]   contradiction of the company philosophy. And I recognized that that was always the problem.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.160]   When I worked for a company, then I always had a duty and a loyalty to the company, to
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   the industry, etc. And so I had to censor my opinions, censor my thoughts out of respect
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:44.920]   for the company and the industry that I worked in. But yet, to leave that with the, again,
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.400]   the expensive decision and difficult decision to do, and then to not be at that place of
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:55.280]   ultimate freedom where I would either live or die by my own words, to me just wasn't
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.520]   going to work out. I decided not to do it. But to this day, I'm still not sure that was
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:10.920]   the best decision. And even today, I think that there are people in, I think that I would
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.960]   be well served, me personally, by not being at the front of the line. Even today, I have
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   thought many times when I get to my thousandth episode of Radical Personal Finance, do I
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.200]   keep doing Radical Personal Finance or do I do something else? When I started this show,
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:33.360]   I could not go and work for, I couldn't have gone and worked for someone like Dave Ramsey.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.760]   Today, I could go and work for Dave Ramsey. Dave and I don't have to agree on the value
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.640]   of cash value life insurance. I'd happily kiss that goodbye and never talk again about
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:47.880]   cash value life insurance. But when I look at organizations like his in the personal
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:55.400]   finance space and I see how much support they bring to people, someone like me, I have very
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:00.760]   seriously considered reaching out to people like him or to his team or to other, I've
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:06.360]   thought about talking to other radio people, etc. Because when you're on the front line
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.880]   and you're trying to do it all, it's not a good, you can't do it all. You have to specialize.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.400]   And so then you have to build the team yourself. And then the question is, is that one of your
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:21.880]   skills, is building the team one of your skills? And for me, it has not been a skill that I
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.200]   have shown that I'm very good at, to build the team. The very best teams, and you can
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.520]   read about this in some of the entrepreneurial books, but I think the very best, most successful
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:35.080]   opportunity is when you have maybe one person who's the visionary, who's the front line,
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.080]   but you've got to have somebody alongside who can handle the administrative stuff. And
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.500]   what has hurt me in my business activities is I have not found or developed that person
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:51.040]   on the side. And it's, so to your point that yes, I think that being that number two would
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.320]   be great. And if you have skill sets that are complimentary, a lot of times people who
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.680]   are out in front desperately know they need help, but they just don't know how to do it
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.400]   because their skill set is being the visionary or being the loud mouth in my case. And they
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:11.760]   know that they can't do both very well. So yeah, I think it's a good strategy. And to
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.720]   this day, I think I would be much more able today to give up some freedom in order to
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.360]   make a bigger impact than I would have been a number of years ago. So that's my personal
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.640]   story and I think the number two strategy is an excellent one. We lost Andy there at
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.280]   the end, but I think that's enough. Andy, thank you for calling in. I really enjoyed
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.360]   all the good questions. I hope that the audience, I hope that you listen to them. I guess I
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.600]   should say if any of you are, I don't really, I'm not looking for a job today, but if any
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.920]   of you are in the Dave Ramsey organization or other, there are a couple of the media
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.320]   organizations that are large that my brand could fit under, then feel free to reach out
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:53.200]   to me. You never know what a couple of years from now might hold. So here I'll close with
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.440]   reading the proverb that Andy and I alluded to. This comes from the Bible Proverbs chapter
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:05.520]   30 verses seven through nine. Two things I ask of you, deny them not to me before I die.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:13.920]   Remove far from me falsehood and lying. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:20.280]   the food that is needful for me. Lest I be full and deny you and say, who is the Lord?
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:25.880]   Or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God. That's the proverb we were
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.440]   alluding to. Thank you so much for listening to today's show. I hope that you enjoyed it.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.920]   I wish you a very happy Friday and an excellent weekend and I'll be back with you very soon.
