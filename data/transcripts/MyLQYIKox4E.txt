[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Well, if you've read and studied the Gospels, you notice that in the life of Christ, there's
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.800]   not a lot of detail about temple practices, in particular, animal sacrifices.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.940]   We know that Jesus, as a small child, was presented at the temple with an offering of
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.840]   turtle doves or pigeons.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.240]   That's told to us in Luke 2 24.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.280]   This was the offering of a poor mother in lieu of a lamb sacrifice, as permitted in
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   Leviticus 12 8.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.320]   But this is a pretty rare connection between Christ's life and the temple sacrifices.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540]   In fact, later in his ministry, Jesus will forgive sin all by himself, bypassing the
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.380]   whole Jewish sacrificial system altogether.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.400]   And that leads to a question from Karen, a listener to the podcast who wants to know
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   why.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400]   Here's her email.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.400]   My name is Karen and I live in Germany.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.520]   Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.000]   My question concerns the act of forgiveness mentioned in the Bible.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.240]   I have learned that without blood, there is no forgiveness.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.840]   Hence, the sacrifices in the Old Testament and the dying of Jesus in the New Testament.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.040]   I understand that.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.800]   But what I don't understand is the period between the two.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.320]   When Jesus walked on earth, he often addressed people simply by telling them that their sins
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320]   were forgiven.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.760]   He didn't prescribe an offering in the temple and he did not shed his own blood yet.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.880]   So how was that possible under the assumption that blood was still needed for forgiveness?
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.680]   This may sound like a question with limited application or a question of interest to only
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.240]   a tiny number of Christians, but I want to show that it touches on the issue that is
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.400]   at the heart of Christianity.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.320]   And every Christian needs to be aware of it for our own stability and courage and joy.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   So hang on.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   The question starts with a biblical assumption from Hebrews 9.22, which says, "Without the
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.920]   shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins."
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   That's what it says.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.700]   So God instituted in the Old Testament the way, the plan, that there would be animal
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:25.480]   sacrifices and that sinners who look to God and by faith identify with this killed animal
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.320]   would be forgiven for their sins.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.960]   The death of the animal would be counted, so to speak, as the punishment for their sin.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.260]   For example, in Leviticus 4.15, "If the people as a whole have sinned," it says, "the elders
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.860]   of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the Lord, and
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.820]   the bull shall be killed before the Lord."
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.960]   In verse 20, "The priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven."
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.620]   So that's where Karen's question starts.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.180]   God regards sin as so evil and so destructive that in order to set things right, there must
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.660]   be a death, a bloodshedding, in order for sins not to be counted, that is, to be forgiven.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.960]   Then the second premise of Karen's question is that Christ has in fact shed his own blood
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:41.180]   for sinners so that if we are united to Christ by faith, our sins are forgiven for his sake.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.300]   His bloodshedding counts for ours, for us.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.500]   He became a curse for us, Galatians 3.13.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.460]   He bore our condemnation in his flesh, Romans 8.3.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.260]   This is the center and the glory of the gospel.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.420]   So Paul says in Romans 5.9, "We have now been justified by his blood," or Ephesians 1.7,
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.580]   "In him we have redemption through his blood," or Ephesians 2.13, "You who were far off have
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.300]   been brought near by the blood of Christ."
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.900]   So Karen's question is, when Jesus walked the earth, he often addressed people by telling
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.380]   them that their sins are forgiven, but she says, there was no offering in the temple
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.100]   and Jesus had not yet died.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.260]   How is that possible under the assumption that blood is needed in order for the forgiveness
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.300]   of God from all the sins that we do, that take place?
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.420]   Now let's clarify the question, first of all.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:00.340]   Whether or not there were sacrifices being offered in the temple, Jesus pronounced forgiveness
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.540]   on his own authority without any reference to those sacrifices.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:14.780]   For example, in Mark 2.6 and 7, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.900]   And the scribes say, "Why does this man speak like that?
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.620]   He's blaspheming.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.180]   Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.020]   So Karen wonders about this relationship of forgiveness that Jesus pronounced to the God-appointed
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:42.380]   shedding of blood when Jesus hasn't yet shed his blood and he isn't pointing people to
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.260]   the bloodshedding of the animals.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.940]   Here's one of the keys that unlocks this puzzle for Karen.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.900]   In Hebrews 10.4 and 11, the writer says, "It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.140]   to take away sins."
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:10.860]   Verse 11, "Every priest standing daily at his service offering repeatedly the same sacrifices,
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.820]   which can never take away sins."
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:23.220]   So now we get the startling revelation that all those animal sacrifices actually in themselves
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.860]   accomplished nothing.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.140]   Oh, like we're not between two really effective seasons here, Old Testament and New Testament.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:40.460]   The forgiveness that God pronounced on faithful worshipers in the Old Testament was not ultimately
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.300]   owing to animal sacrifices.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.500]   The true saints in the Old Testament, they grasped this.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.100]   They did at some level.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.900]   For example, David said in Psalm 51, "You will not delight in sacrifice or I would give
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   it.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.340]   You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.700]   The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.820]   Oh God, you will not despise."
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:13.120]   And God said in Hosea 6.6, "I desire steadfast love, not sacrifice."
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.300]   The knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.460]   And Jesus quoted that verse, Hosea 6.6, twice to show how badly some of the Jewish leaders
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.780]   were misreading the Old Testament in Matthew 9.13 and 12.7.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:36.940]   So now we can see that Karen's question about forgiveness during Jesus' lifetime really
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.440]   does apply to the entire history of Israel.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.860]   The animal sacrifices were not achieving the forgiveness of sins.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.220]   Not ever.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.100]   So what were they doing?
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:59.020]   The answer is, they were pointing to Jesus, God's final, once-for-all, decisive sacrifice
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020]   for sins.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.820]   They were foreshadowing the bloodshedding of Christ.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:11.560]   So it says in Hebrews 9.12, "Christ entered once for all into the holy places, not by
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.120]   means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus securing an
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.520]   eternal redemption."
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.360]   So the reason all bloodshedding has ceased, animal bloodshedding has ceased, Christ's
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.440]   bloodshedding has ceased once for all, is that Christ's sacrifice was so complete, so
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.080]   glorious, so full, so decisive, that it secured an eternal redemption.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.280]   If you have Christ, you have eternal forgiveness for all sins.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.380]   Now I think Karen knows this, but what she may have overlooked, I don't know, but what
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:58.580]   she may have overlooked is that not only does the sacrifice of Christ extend forward as
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:06.560]   an eternal redemption, but also backward in history as a redemption for all those saints
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.320]   who put their faith in God for his forgiveness through the foreshadowing of the cross in
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   the animal sacrifices.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:19.140]   You know, the cross works effectively backward and forward, and that's what Paul makes clear
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.100]   in Romans 3, 25 and 26.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:30.100]   He says, "God put Christ forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:38.620]   This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.980]   former sins."
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:50.300]   In other words, the reason God was righteous to pass over, that is, forgive, the sins of
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:59.020]   all Old Testament saints and the sins that Jesus forgave during his lifetime was that
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.500]   God was looking to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:14.820]   So just as our sins 2,000 years after Christ are covered by the blood of Christ, so Abraham's
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:23.180]   sins were covered by the cross of Christ 2,000 years before Christ existed.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.660]   And so it was with all the saints in between.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:33.640]   So Karen's question is not of limited significance.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:41.560]   It takes us to the very center of the gospel, indeed the center of reality, and shows us
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:48.520]   that all forgiveness, all of it, and all the benefits that flow from forgiveness through
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.920]   all time, as far back as you can go, as far forward as you can go, all of it, all that
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:05.420]   forgiveness is based on those few hours when the Son of God suffered and bled and died
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.800]   for sinners.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:16.080]   If we grasp how central, how profound, how glorious was that divine moment, that divine
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:24.680]   achievement, our lives will be more stable, more courageous, and more joyful.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   So good.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.320]   Romans 3 25 is precious.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.440]   It reminds me of an APJ we did like eight years ago now.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.220]   I remember it, Pastor John, because you said if somebody put a gun to your head and made
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.720]   you choose the most important verse in the Bible, this is the verse you would choose.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.240]   Romans 3 25.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.760]   You can hear why in APJ 272 for that.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   You can find APJ 272 at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.920]   And of course there you'll find 1,800 or so other episodes to browse, to search.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.640]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.240]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.120]   Have a great weekend.
