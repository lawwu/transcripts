[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   We really struggle to find a single domain of life
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.920]   that is not negatively impacted
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.560]   when our sleep is not working as well as it could.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.320]   When you think about cognition,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   when you think about cardiovascular health,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.480]   when you think about immune health,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   when you think about emotional regulation,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.280]   mental health, et cetera,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   the ripple effects are so vast
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.320]   from a negative side of things
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.480]   when we're not getting the sleep that we require,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.840]   whether in duration, regularity,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.600]   the quality of that sleep.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   But then on the flip side,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.040]   from a more potentially positive spin,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.800]   we struggle to find areas of life
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.780]   that are not positively impacted from a ripple effect
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600]   when we do improve this area of our life.
