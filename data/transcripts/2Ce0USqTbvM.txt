[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980]   As a policy, I'd never charge for a second opinion unless we had to take another x-ray.
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.400]   But if it's just a quick look, it's 15 minutes.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.360]   I did that for the betterment of the profession.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.060]   I wanted patients to do well through the process.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.200]   And it wasn't because I wanted them to stay with me.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.380]   A lot of the time I would send them back and say, you know what?
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.260]   They're right.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.900]   Or it would be a lot of these second opinions are about bad dental work.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.520]   And then I would send, I would give them an option.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.400]   There's a very inexpensive option.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.560]   Instead of hiring a lawyer, there's a peer review system.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   And I would hook them up with that.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200]   Every dental society has a peer review system.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.880]   They go in, they have three dentists look at it.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.020]   If it is bad dental work, then it gets written up.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.940]   And their membership is at risk.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.980]   So they return the money and then they move on.
