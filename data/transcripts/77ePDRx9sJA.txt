[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   [music]
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.080]   Podcast listener John Anders writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.160]   "Pastor John, I've had various physical injuries over the past several years that have drastically
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.000]   and positively impacted my life.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   God has done much through my suffering and sorrows.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.880]   How can I most magnify the gospel through my everyday actions in the midst of a debilitating
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.600]   injury so that others see His glory and come to delight in Christ?"
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.960]   Well the first thing I want to say is that in asking the question this way, John has
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.760]   been his own answer.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   How can I magnify the gospel through my everyday actions in the midst of suffering?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.920]   Whoa.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   I mean he's already done it for me anyway.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.880]   He's caused me to be thankful for God's grace in his life.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:07.000]   My sufferings have drastically and positively, that's an amazingly gracious word, impacted
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.920]   my life.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.400]   So what can I say to him when he has already been his own answer?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.480]   It seems to me like anything I would say here would be building on a very good foundation.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.360]   So let me just draw attention to some biblical things that I'm sure John knows and may just
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.620]   be an encouragement to hear me say.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.680]   How can I magnify the gospel?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.840]   How can I magnify Christ in suffering so that others see Christ's glory and delight in Him?
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   He asks.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.400]   There are two kinds of answer to that question.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.440]   One is how can John maintain his own faith and hope and joy in suffering because without
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.600]   that he would be of no use to others.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.880]   And the other way of answering the question is to think with him about the sorts of things
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   he might do to help others enjoy what he's enjoying.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.600]   So the two halves, how does he maintain his own faith and joy and then maintaining it,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.780]   what kinds of things might he do or say that would help others?
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.000]   So here's my answer to the first half.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.080]   John, recall, this is how to maintain your faith.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.520]   I mean, you're doing obviously a great job of it, but let's do it more and more.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.880]   Recall that Christ, by his gospel work of dying for us and rising again, has secured
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.360]   all the promises of God.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.760]   All of them find their yes in him, 2 Corinthians 1:20.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.640]   Second, learn from Paul's own suffering that God's good purpose in it all is that we will
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.040]   rely on God who raises the dead, 2 Corinthians 1:8.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.200]   We were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.800]   Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.840]   That was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.200]   So every horrible thing that comes into our life is meant to cause us to fall on the Christ
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.920]   who raises the dead and increase in our confidence that we will be raised and we should rely
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.000]   on nothing but him.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.560]   Third, take heart from the biblical assurance that suffering is preparing for us an eternal
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.200]   weight of glory, in 2 Corinthians 4:16.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.240]   We do not lose heart, though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.200]   renewed day by day, for this light momentary affliction, namely lifelong affliction in
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.440]   John's case, is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.280]   So take heart.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Everything we walk through is working and preparing and increasing a weight of glory
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.320]   in the age to come for us.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.200]   And embrace Paul's experience that when he asked the Lord to take away the thorn and
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.160]   doesn't give it, he glories in the all-sufficiency of the grace of Christ, which is what you're
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   doing.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   Three times I pleaded with the Lord that he would take it away from me, and he said, "My
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   grace is sufficient for you.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.600]   My power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.680]   Therefore I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   may rest upon me.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.400]   For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weakness and insults and hardships and
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.640]   persecutions and calamities; for when I am weak, then am I strong."
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.560]   And in those verses, John, we've already moved to the second way of answering the question,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   haven't we?
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   Namely, not just how can you maintain your joy, your hope, your faith, but what sorts
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   of things might you do that would help other people see and enjoy Christ?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   Because Paul just said in those verses, "I boast in my weaknesses.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.440]   I'm content in my weaknesses."
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.680]   And so that's the sorts of things we should do.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.600]   We should exult in Christ in our weaknesses.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.540]   So I would say maybe here's three concrete suggestions, and who am I to talk?
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.920]   You know these.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.500]   The sheer freedom from murmuring.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.560]   So don't murmur against God.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.240]   The sheer freedom of murmuring against God.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.440]   Paul says in Philippians 2:15, "Is a light shining in a dark place."
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.600]   If we don't murmur in our lives when hard things come, we are like lights shining, and
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.200]   that's exactly what John said he wants to be.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.960]   And the second thing is give expressions of praise to the goodness of God.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.520]   There are a few people in my life, I think of one woman in particular, who lives with
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.920]   a chronic pain, chronic disability, and I know no one who's more full of praise than
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   she is, and it is a powerful witness of God in my life every time we're around each other.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.720]   So expressions of praise and attributions of the goodness of God.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.920]   And the third one I would mention is live your life focused on others.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.200]   Don't draw attention to your own injuries or disabilities, but take thought for others.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   This is what Paul said is the very essence of the mind of Christ in Philippians 2.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.940]   Don't just take thought for yourself, but take thought for others, even when everything
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.720]   in you may be crying out, "I hurt.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   Pity me."
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:16.480]   So thank you, John, for already causing me to be more thankful for Christ in your life,
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   and may God grant you great grace.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.960]   As he said, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.960]   May it be so for you and for all of those who suffer.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.160]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   And John, thank you for the question, and thank you for your testimony to all of us.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.840]   And I'm thankful for all of you who joined us again on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.800]   We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   God bless.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   God bless.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   God bless.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   God bless.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   God bless.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   God bless.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   God bless.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   God bless.
