[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Well, on Monday, we opened the week talking about the relationship between Christian hedonism
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.060]   and historic reform theology. And Wednesday, we looked at what Pastor John's fears and
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.360]   hopes for Christian hedonism are after he's gone. And today, we look at the title Desiring
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.220]   God Itself and some alternatives. The question is from Trent in Columbus, Ohio. Pastor John,
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.080]   I was recently celebrating the impact of your ministry with a friend at Chick-fil-A of all
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.760]   places. We were both stumped by a question. It's this, "How did you arrive at the name
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.120]   Desiring God when so much of the ministry is not merely aspirational, but is focused
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.640]   on the actual act of enjoying God Himself in Bible reading and in sermons, for example?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   Why not something more accurate like delighting in God?" Pastor John, what would you say to
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   Trent?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.880]   I like this question. It's a good question. It's an insightful question, and the answer
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.020]   will, I think, be illuminating. Trying to answer it really does reveal a great deal
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:13.120]   about the nature of Christian hedonism and a little bit about me. Maybe a lot about me.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:21.600]   I'll give you six reasons, all right, why the book has the title Desiring God. And some
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.880]   of them are more substantial than others, but they all figure in, I think. Number one,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.240]   back when the book was being written between 1983 and 1987, two books were very influential,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.320]   popular, significant, that I admired very much, Knowing God by J.I. Packer and Loving
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   God by Charles Colson. As an utterly unknown writer, me in those days, I had the wild and
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.240]   crazy dream that maybe my little book could someday be viewed as part of that trajectory
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.920]   by those great men, right? So it seemed like Desiring God would fit with Knowing God and
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   Loving God and Desiring God. Was that vain or what? I don't know. It was a dream. Number
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.720]   two, alternative titles didn't fit my sense of what might be arresting and intriguing
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.060]   and provocative and true, some of my criteria. For example, delighting seemed to be a word
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.440]   very few people use except in more refined settings. Enjoying God and rejoicing in God
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.520]   seemed to me to have the feeling of too much religiosity and not enough ordinariness. Happy
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   can't be made a verb in English, and the phrase being happy in God sounded cheesy. So when
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.260]   it came down to it, Desiring God simply had the right sound and the right connotations
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.560]   for the impact I wanted the title to have. And of course, I could have been wrong. Number
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.120]   three, as I recall in those days, a cluster of texts was having a tremendous effect on
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:28.220]   me for good by awakening in me strong longings for God. Texts like Psalm 73, "You guide me
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.240]   with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.440]   but you, and there's nothing on earth I desire besides you? My flesh and my heart may fail
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.080]   you are the strength of my heart and my portion forever." Or Psalm 42, "As a deer pants for
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   the flowing stream, so my soul pants for you, O God, my soul thirsts for God." Or Psalm
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.280]   63, "O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you, my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.840]   for you." All those texts seemed to point toward the profound importance of having a
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.720]   heart that continually desires—desires God. Pants for God, thirst for God, seeks for God,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   faints for God. So that just seemed like, "Whoa, this is biblical!"
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.960]   Number four, it was clear to me then, and it is even clearer now, how many years later,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   that every experience of delight or joy or satisfaction or happiness or contentment or
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.920]   cherishing or restfulness—every single experience in this present time and world
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   of God's goodness and God's wisdom and God's love, no matter how deep, no matter how sweet,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:59.520]   no matter how transforming, will be a mere taste of what is coming to us on the other
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.320]   side of the grave and in the resurrection. Which means that even when we have experiences
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:17.000]   that are full of real joy in God now, they are dominated by experiences of desire. Because
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.600]   genuine, spiritual, Christ-exalting joy is rooted in an infinite reality, and we are
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.280]   prevented from feeling appropriate, full, all-satisfying responses to that reality by
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.960]   our finitude, and in this life, by our sin. Therefore, the concept of desire as central
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.560]   to the book is because it's central to the Christian life. It's not an arbitrary choice;
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   it's built into our finitude. The very best experiences of joy in this world are incomplete,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   and therefore baked in is desire. Number five, no doubt I was influenced by C.S. Lewis. Nobody
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:17.440]   in my experience captured the utterly crucial dimension of human longing—Zehnsucht, German,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.800]   he used that phrase—longing in this world as evidence of the next world. Desire was
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.120]   the very reality that brought C.S. Lewis to Christ, and desire remained a hallmark of
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.160]   all his experiences of God. And he just had a—I just found everything he wrote on this—well,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   yeah, that's right! Number six, my own experience certainly played a huge role in the choice
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.680]   of desiring God. I don't have the sharpness of mind or the penetrating analytical abilities
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.120]   of a Lewis, or the capacities to observe the world like Lewis does. He's just off the charts
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:06.480]   superior to me. But everything he said about longing of my heart in this finite fallen
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:14.960]   world as ever-reaching, ever-grasping, ever-stretching to something beyond, and never being content
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   with the present experience of ultimate reality, all of it rang true, deeply true to me, and
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:31.320]   does to this day. I am fundamentally a desirer. That's my life. In a sense, all I do—I thought
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.080]   about this sentence, now I'm going to say it—in a sense, all I do in this world is
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:49.520]   direct, intensify, or diminish my desires. That's all I do. That's my life. And it wouldn't
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.840]   be wrong to paraphrase Christian hedonism like this, "God is most glorified in us when
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:06.720]   we cleave to him alone for the ultimate satisfaction of all our desires." As far as I can remember,
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.520]   those are the reasons that I named the book Desiring God.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.040]   Very insightful, helpful look back on the origins of that title. Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.000]   Well there are introverts and there are extroverts, and that's the topic Monday. Specifically,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.700]   how should we think about particular ways God has wired us? Some who are energized by
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.780]   being around others and others who are energized by being away from people. Specifically for
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:56.800]   introverts, how do we guard against social selfishness? That is the question on Monday
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.120]   when we return. I'm looking forward to that one. I'm your host Tony Reike. We'll see you
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.320]   then.
