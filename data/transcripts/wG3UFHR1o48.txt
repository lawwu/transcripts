[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Everybody experiences hiccups from time to time.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.760]   I think most people would agree that one hiccup,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.520]   sort of funny, two hiccups in a row is really funny.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.640]   And three hiccups in a row is where it starts
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.560]   to be concerning in part because hiccups
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.940]   can be kind of painful.
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.440]   There is a technique that can reliably eliminate hiccups.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.640]   And it's a technique that takes advantage
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.040]   of hyper-contracting the phrenic nerve
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   over a short period of time so that it then subsequently
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.640]   relaxes or alleviates the spasming of the phrenic nerve.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.760]   And that simple method is to inhale three times in a row.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.780]   This is a very unusual pattern of breathing,
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.160]   but what it involves is taking a big deep inhale
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.440]   through your nose.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260]   Then before you exhale any air,
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.960]   take a second inhale through the nose,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.480]   however brief that inhale might be.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.220]   And then a third, even micro or millisecond long inhale
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.240]   through your nose to get that third inhale
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.160]   and then hold your breath for about 15 to 20 seconds
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.600]   and then slowly exhale.
