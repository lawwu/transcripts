[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   (Silence)
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.120]   Psalm 8, how majestic is your name.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.680]   For the choir director, according to the Gethsemane, a psalm of David.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.120]   O Yahweh our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.080]   who displays your splendour above the heavens.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.160]   From the mouth of infants and nursing babes you have established strength
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.560]   because of your adversaries to make the enemy
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.240]   and the revengeful cease. When I see your heavens, the work of
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.440]   your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have established,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.120]   what is man that you remember him and the son of man that you care for him?
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.880]   Yet you have made him a little lower than the angels and you crowned him with
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.400]   glory and majesty. You make him to rule over the works of
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.320]   your hands. You've put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.800]   and also the animals of the field, the birds of the heavens
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.320]   and the fish of the sea, whatever passes through
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   the paths of the sea. O Yahweh our Lord, how majestic is your name
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.000]   in all the earth.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
