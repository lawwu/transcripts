[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   - If we could do a top contour survey
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   of the greats of astronomy, where would it start?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.720]   Starting with people who got it wrong and then correct each other.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.520]   If we were going to do a fast sprint through these, where would we start?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.600]   - Well, you'd have to start with like Gog or whatever,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.200]   you know, the first cavemen and women, you know, as I said, the 40,000-
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.920]   - Charting stars on the wall of the cave.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920]   - Exactly.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920]   We don't know who they are.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.720]   The ancestors, like, okay, you know, because those stars are there relative
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.120]   to that ridge or et cetera, days are getting longer, days are getting shorter.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   - That's right.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.460]   - Ergo hunt now, ergo collect stuff to hunker down.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.520]   Maybe even don't reproduce now.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040]   Maybe even behavioral restraint.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.040]   - 100%.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.520]   - Maybe reproduce now.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520]   - Yeah.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.520]   - Yeah.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   - It's going to be much more, you know, optimal time for that.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520]   - Right, right.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   - Exactly.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.400]   So tens of thousands, pre-antiquity, you would say.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.080]   Then the, I would say fast forward, you know, to the maybe Egyptian epoch,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.940]   you know, 5,000 BCE, so to speak, when they had a, also a very zodiological
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.120]   and astrological conception of these objects, but, and yet they would build
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.160]   things, you know, in relation to the positions of stars and constellations.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   - Sundial emerges.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.320]   - Sundial, obelisks, you know, things that were used, primitive things.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.720]   Stonehenge also, I think it's like 20,000 years ago.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   They believe it's related to some astronomical observations.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.560]   They're not entirely certain about that.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.960]   - We have to double-click on Stonehenge.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.300]   How do you think it got there?
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.040]   - You know, it's one of those great mysteries that's, I think it's less
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.920]   controversial Stonehenge than the pyramids.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.660]   The pyramids seem to be like almost, you know, they lead people into thinking
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.120]   about aliens and all sorts of stuff.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.680]   - But what do you think of, is it, I mean, given their mass, given their location,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.720]   given what we knew about populations then, and given what we know about the
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.480]   strength of people and the tools they had at the time, is it reasonable to assume
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.720]   that people built these things?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.520]   - I mean, certainly, I mean, you'd have to convince me that people didn't build
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.760]   them, but exactly how they built it is a great question.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.720]   I mean, so for example, I mentioned this when I was on Joe Rogan's show.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.000]   I said, you know, if you measure the bases of the pyramids, it turns out that
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.720]   they're a ratio of a cubit, which is actually cubits, not quantum bits like
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.800]   you and your dad talked about, but cubits is the length of the pharaoh's forearm.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.640]   It's basically a foot and a half, roughly.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.600]   So back then, if you were like the president, you were also the metric
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.480]   standard for all of civilization.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.980]   - Wild.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.080]   - And it makes...
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.800]   - Sort of like models on Instagram, right?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.480]   Everyone's trying to attain these.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.520]   What's the standard?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.160]   - That's right, exactly, right?
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.280]   - What's the standard?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.600]   Wild.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.400]   So the pharaoh's forearm, and is this about carrying items?
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.800]   - Yeah, well, it was just for length or like a foot.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.440]   We talk about a foot, it was a pharaoh's foot.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.800]   Yeah, that's where we get those from, right?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640]   So there was only kind of one rough standard for calibration, which is
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.680]   incredibly important for removing systematic effects in science in general.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   So you had a calibration standard.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.200]   Now we have like a bar of platinum.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.040]   We've defined, you know, the second in terms of oscillations of a certain atom
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.160]   called cesium and how many times it oscillates per second.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.320]   - Sure, a degree, right?
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.960]   Yeah, a calorie, right?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.240]   - So now we want to define those in terms of physical quantities,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640]   not in terms of people.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.440]   And so doing that has been a great advance forward in science.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.720]   And we've only recently gotten rid of what are called artifacts.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.480]   So it used to be there was a rod that was one meter long.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.760]   And the meter was originally defined as 69,000, I forget,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.920]   of the distance from the North Pole to Paris.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   But that obviously depends on assuming the earth is a perfect sphere,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.720]   which it's not, right?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.040]   - It's kind of chubby around the middle, right?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.560]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.080]   It bulges because it's an oblate sphere, right, exactly.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   And so all these things that were relics, we want to get rid of them and
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.120]   tie them to fundamental properties of, say, a quantum system that's very pure
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.360]   and we can isolate it.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.800]   We don't want to use a pharaoh's foot either.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   So we have to come up with a link standard.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.880]   So now we use the speed of light times the second and we can define things
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.800]   in those terms.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.480]   But back then, yeah, so they didn't know that.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.360]   But I told Joe, as I said, if you measure the base of all the great
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.480]   pyramids at Giza, they're all multiples of a cubit times so
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.360]   many numbers of the number pi.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.920]   So, like, but pi wasn't known to them.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.880]   You know, pi wasn't known to be rational to Greeks and Euclid proved that it was
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.800]   irrational and that, you know, it didn't come from a computational,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.480]   it couldn't easily be obtained from...it had infinite number of digits, right?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.120]   So how did these Egyptians know that?
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.800]   An alien told them, "No."
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.000]   The way they did it is they laid it out, they used a surveyor's tool.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.640]   One of the surveyor's tool is a stick with a wheel on it.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.960]   So the wheel is a circle, so you got so many multiples, they just count it
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   and that's how...so we confuse a lot of things.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.320]   Stumbled into pi.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.280]   Exactly, right?
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.800]   They walked all over it.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.480]   So you don't have to always posit supernatural explanations for things.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.680]   The answer is simply, we don't know, I certainly don't know how Stonehenge was
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   built nor do I know how the pyramids were built, but it's not...you would have to
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.720]   convince me that it was built by some other means other than people and the
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   tools that were available to them.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.600]   Yeah, likewise.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.840]   I'm not convinced it came from extraterrestrial sources.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.520]   Yes, I don't remember how we got on this, but timekeeping, yeah.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.000]   So we were marching through, so we have our ancient ancestors, and then at what
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.600]   point do we get to Copernicus and Galileo?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.360]   Then it was, yeah, then it was Copernicus who had ideas but couldn't prove them,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680]   he had no data to substantiate the Copernican or sun-centered model of the
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.280]   universe, which is also...
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.880]   By the way, almost everything in science is wrong, right?
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.240]   Copernicus is wrong.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.400]   The sun is not the center of the solar system, right?
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.440]   The center of our solar system is inside the sun because the planets orbit around
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   it and they orbit around an elliptical pattern, which has two foci.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.600]   So he believed the orbits were all circles.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.760]   So he's wrong, but he's more right than Aristotle.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   So that's how science progresses, right?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   Newton was right about gravity until he was wrong when Einstein proved him wrong,
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.680]   right?
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.200]   So then you come up to, after him, Kepler discovered the laws of the elliptical
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.400]   motion of planets and their patterns that we still use.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.200]   When you discover an exoplanet, my colleague David Kipping, I want to
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.480]   introduce you to, he's discovered exomoons.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   These are moons around other planets, some of which are in the habitable zone of
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.160]   their host star, and some of them have sun-like stars and are Earth-sized
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.640]   planets.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.520]   It's incredible.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.680]   There could be, as I said, a link between life evolving on Earth due to the moon
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.560]   on our planet, so too on an exoplanet, it could require an exomoon, which he's
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.520]   discovered or thinks he has.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.400]   He's actually very cautious and hasn't said it explicitly.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.760]   So Kepler's laws underpin all those discoveries, even to this day, 400 years
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.400]   later.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.120]   Then Galileo, immediately afterwards with the telescope, phases of Venus that
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.160]   only occur if the Earth is not the center of the solar system.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.120]   The rings of Saturn, he had notions about those.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.000]   He accidentally discovered the planet Neptune.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.360]   It's amazing.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.800]   And then he, of course, the moons of Jupiter falsified the notion that the
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.280]   Earth is the center of the solar system, because these moons are going around
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.480]   Jupiter, not around the Earth.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.200]   So that completely torpedoed the notion of the true nature of the Aristotelian or
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.080]   Ptolemaic Earth-centered cosmology.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.920]   Then soon after that, astronomers measured things like the speed of light
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.960]   using eclipses of the moons of Jupiter.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.120]   They measured distances to Saturn.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.280]   They mapped out the solar system.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.920]   And then from there, using parallax, you can gauge the triangulation and using
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.560]   trigonometry, measure the structure of our galaxy.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.520]   William Herschel and his sister, Caroline Herschel, was the first female
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.440]   astronomer, first female scientist.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.800]   She was the first person to use the scientific method and become a fellow of
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.200]   the Royal Society in Great Britain.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:48.920]   And then later off after that, we come to the era of the last-- the big
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.320]   developments in technology were photographic plates.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.520]   After that, spectrographs, dispersion of light onto photographic material.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.880]   You could preserve your memory.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.280]   You didn't use sketches like Galileo did.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.200]   And then up until Hubble, when Hubble discovered two major things, which was--
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.360]   one was that the Milky Way was a galaxy.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.640]   It wasn't the entire universe.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.320]   There were other galaxies, island universes of billions of stars.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.440]   And then he discovered the expansion of the universe with help from an
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.200]   astronomer who doesn't get a lot of attention.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.960]   A lot of the women in astronomy got really short shrift.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.040]   People discovered how fusion works in the sun.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.840]   Women-- Gaspachin at Harvard.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.800]   And then Henrietta Leavitt, who measured this relationship between the size and
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   brightness of objects called Cepheid variables that Hubble then used to make
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.520]   his law that proved that the universe is expanding.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.400]   And then after that, people like Penzias and Wilson discovering the
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.080]   microwave and radio astronomy.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   Robert Jansky.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.160]   All the way up until, you know, my colleagues today, some of whom I've
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.920]   interviewed, Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt and Barry Barish, who wrote the
