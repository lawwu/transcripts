[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   It is Friday and it's time for another
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.760]   Friday phone call with Don Carson.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.280]   This is a special episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.720]   and it comes to you in partnership with our friends
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.060]   over at the Gospel Coalition.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.840]   Dr. Carson is the co-founder and the president
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.920]   of the Gospel Coalition and he is also the editor
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.000]   of the new NIV Zondervan Study Bible
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.360]   which focuses on biblical theological themes
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   as they develop from Genesis to Revelation
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.840]   all the way through the Bible.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.280]   And that's something of what we're doing on Fridays.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   On Fridays every three weeks or so,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.440]   we pick up one of these themes for discussion
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.220]   and I pick up the phone.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.060]   Don Carson.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.160]   Dr. Carson, Tony Reinke, Desiring God, hello
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740]   and thank you for joining us again.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.640]   Last time you shared a historical overview
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000]   of the entire Bible, the whole thing.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.540]   And today we need to focus in on one of the implications
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.740]   that we touched on last time which is creation,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.120]   those first two chapters of Genesis.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.240]   Can you explain to us a biblical theology of creation?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.060]   Yes.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.720]   All right, take it away.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.280]   Today when Christians talk about the doctrine of creation,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   a lot of the discussion immediately turns
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   to when creation took place, how it relates
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   to claims of evolutionists, old earth, young earth
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.540]   and things of that order.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.740]   And certainly such questions are important
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.960]   but it's not the place where the Bible itself lays
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.520]   the primary emphasis.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.360]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   About 50 years ago, Francis Schaeffer wrote a book
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.120]   called Genesis in Space and Time.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.800]   And in it, he asked a question that I've increasingly come
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.120]   to see as fundamental.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.660]   What is the least, he asks, that we must make
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.520]   of Genesis 1 to 11 in order for the rest
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.600]   of the Bible to be coherent and true?
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.180]   Now he is not asking what is the most that you can draw
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.940]   from Genesis 1 to 11 and Genesis 1 to 3 in particular
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.980]   but what is the least that we must be certain about,
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.180]   clear about for the rest of the Bible
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.360]   to be coherent and true?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.600]   That's a very shrewd question because it's a way of saying
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.260]   those are the things that we must most emphasize
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   and that are least negotiable.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.140]   So let me outline some of those kinds of things.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.420]   This is a mirror survey.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.840]   Each of the points I'm about to mention could easily
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100]   be expanded into an hour's address.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.240]   And instead, I'm gonna go through a handful of them
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.620]   rather quickly.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.400]   Number one, God comes first.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.140]   This is such an elementary point but it needs
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.260]   to be articulated.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.220]   Before anything else was, before there was a universe
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.280]   in the beginning, God, he comes first.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.460]   And that is teased out in other scriptures to show
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.740]   that God in eternity past was not dependent upon us.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.100]   It is not that God needed the universe
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.520]   so he wouldn't be lonely.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.700]   Eventually, the Bible fleshes out the notion of God
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.260]   in all kinds of ways to show that in the past,
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.480]   for example, the father loved the son
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.960]   and the son loved the father.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   So there was a perfection of love in eternity past.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.560]   That's very different from, for example,
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.140]   the vision of Islam where Islam is slow to speak of God
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.740]   being a God of love because that assumes the importance
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.900]   of other and in their insistence on God's uniqueness
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   and sovereignty and separateness,
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.540]   they can stress God's bigness and greatness
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.060]   but it is hard for them to stress God's love.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.360]   The Quran rarely speaks in those terms.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.380]   But the Bible as a whole insists that God is love
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.740]   because in the one God, miraculously, strangely,
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.620]   God is also other.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.100]   In the oneness of God, there is a complexity
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.700]   such that God loves the son.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.620]   The son loves the father, even in eternity past
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.660]   and he doesn't need the universe.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.100]   Number two, God speaks.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.340]   He is a talking God.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.960]   The first thing said of him in scripture
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.060]   that he does is he speaks.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.860]   And by his powerful word,
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.380]   he calls the universe into existence.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.180]   Now, that becomes paradigmatic of God disclosing himself
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.740]   in word right through the whole Bible.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.160]   God is a talking God and he dares to speak in words
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.340]   that human beings can understand.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.780]   Number three, God made everything.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.400]   That, of course, is against pantheism
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.220]   in which everything in the universe is God.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.560]   God and the universe cannot be distinguished.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.300]   It is also against panentheism
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.820]   in which everything in the universe is God
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.900]   but God is not everything in the universe.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.820]   There is more to God than the universe,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.700]   a little bit of God left over, as it were,
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.860]   apart from everything that is made in the universe.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.500]   But here in the scripture,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.260]   there is a distinction between God
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.100]   who exists before everything in the universe
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.680]   and the created order.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.900]   It is against any sort of ontological dualism
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.800]   that is a kind of dualism in which there is a good force
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.380]   and a bad force or one force with a good side
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.500]   and a bad side.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   The Bible is not concocting a world akin to Star Wars.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.600]   Number four, there is one God who is good
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.700]   and he made everything good.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.360]   And so the origin of evil is not intrinsically
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.060]   some combination of a good principle and a bad principle
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.760]   that are in competition.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.440]   Even when the serpent is introduced,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.460]   he is introduced as the most subtle of the creatures
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   that God made.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.660]   And thus there never is any hint of dualism
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.740]   or anything of that sort.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.220]   There is one sovereign God over the whole.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.240]   Of course, that raises all kinds of questions.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.740]   How does God stand behind good and evil?
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.900]   Well, on the long haul, the Bible lays a lot of emphasis
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.640]   on God standing behind good and evil asymmetrically.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.900]   That is, he stands behind good and evil in different ways.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.720]   He stands behind good in such a way
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.660]   that the good is always creditable to him.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.180]   And the evil is always creditable to secondary causalities,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.180]   like the serpent, even though it can't stand
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.380]   outside the sweep of God's sovereignty.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.780]   So when Paul finds himself evangelizing pagans
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.440]   in Acts 17 in the great city of Athens,
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.800]   one of the things that he stresses is that God is so sovereign
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.500]   and other, the creator of all things,
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.660]   that he doesn't need anything.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.820]   The pagan gods are finite.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.800]   They have their needs and their fears,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.020]   their psychological lusts, their joys, their sorrows,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.700]   their triumphs, and so on.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.900]   So a lot of pagan religion is just an attempt
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.220]   to make the gods happy.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.820]   A lot of pagan religion is, you scratch my back,
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.980]   I scratch your back.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.100]   You offer the right sacrifices to the gods
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.060]   and you end up with a fat, healthy baby.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.020]   That is what religion is in a pagan world.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.780]   It is arranged in terms of swaps.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.980]   But if God made everything and needs nothing,
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.300]   how on earth do you trade with him?
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.940]   So already, the beginning of the necessity
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.980]   for the doctrine of grace is established by the storyline
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.320]   of the doctrine of creation.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.560]   God made everything good.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.960]   And that means, in the fifth place,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.600]   that human beings are accountable to God.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.840]   The grounding of our accountability to God
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.040]   is the doctrine of creation.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.300]   It becomes the source of believers' praise.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.680]   Psalm 33, Revelation 4.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.920]   Repeatedly, it's built into the storyline.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.520]   We owe God praise because we're made by him
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   and for him and accountable to him.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.820]   It's only right and good.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.500]   It's sensible.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.440]   Within this framework, then, when people say today,
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.040]   listen, I don't mind if you have your religion,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.940]   your Jesus, and your Bible, but I'm a spiritual person too.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.060]   I have my own religion.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.880]   I have my own approach to the divine and the spiritual.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.000]   Don't keep cramming your Jesus down my throat.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.080]   Then sooner or later, although it might be the part
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.140]   of wisdom and diplomacy and care and love
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.760]   to back off a little and have a go another day,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.960]   yet sooner or later, the loving Christian
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.880]   is going to have to say, very gently and over coffee,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.440]   and within the framework of trusted relationships,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   the Christian is going to have to say,
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.000]   the one thing I can't do is back off
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.360]   because God made you and therefore you owe him
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.560]   and you will give an account to him.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.500]   So the grounding of our accountability to God,
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.440]   our responsibility to him, and the fact that
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.000]   because he's God, he is the final judge
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   of our reactions to him, are all laid in principle
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.320]   in the opening chapters of the book of Genesis.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.000]   Then in the sixth place, there are hints,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.200]   not more than that, there are hints of God's complexity
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.000]   in an expression like, let us make mankind in our own image.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.040]   Some people have tried to understand that to be a royal we,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.600]   but there's no real hint of that in context,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.760]   or that it's God and the court of heaven
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.200]   or something like that, but there's no real hint
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.800]   of that in context.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.000]   I think that in the book of Genesis,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.420]   chapters one, two, and three, there are many, many themes
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.900]   that are introduced without making them clear.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.240]   That is, they're pregnant expressions.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.200]   They're expressions that are fleshed out.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.960]   It would be wrong to read into, let us make,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   an entire doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.240]   It's not there, the components aren't there,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.360]   but there's a hint of it.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   There's an adumbration that God is not simply one-ish.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.040]   He is one God, and yet there is in God complexity
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.720]   such that there is also other.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.800]   You find those things teased out already
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   in an incipient way in the Old Testament,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.760]   and very clear in the New Testament,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.480]   when you find, oh, let's say a passage like John 5,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   God is determined that all should honor the Son
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.140]   even as the honor of the Father,
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.840]   before, in the beginning, John's Gospel says,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.480]   was the word, and the word was with God,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.600]   God's own fellow, and the word was God, God's own self.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.920]   And so you have more and more and more adumbrations
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   until you get to the kind of formulation
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.460]   that you get in the fourth century AD.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.760]   But although the New Testament is much clearer
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.040]   on such things, you have seedlings planted already
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   in the doctrine of creation.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   And I would argue that you have other seedlings.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.560]   I'll just list three or four of them.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.760]   They'll come up later in this series.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.880]   For example, Christians have long argued
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.280]   whether there is a covenant, a covenant of works,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.660]   it's often called, with Adam in chapters two and three.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.640]   And some have said very strongly yes,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.340]   some have said very strongly no.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.040]   Those who say no point out the fact
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.160]   that the word covenant isn't used.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.320]   It's true that word covenant isn't used.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.760]   But nevertheless, there is a kind of established agreement
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.420]   imposed by a sovereign God that demands obedience
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.000]   with threat of judgment unless there is obedience
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.820]   and so forth.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.920]   Many of the elements of what goes into covenantal thinking
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.540]   are already there in Genesis one, two, and three.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.040]   Or again, you don't get mention of the tabernacle
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.960]   till the time of Moses.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.920]   And then temple, not until the time of David and Solomon.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.840]   And yet many have pointed out that the tabernacle,
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.620]   the temple, is the meeting place
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.960]   between God and his image bearers.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.640]   And now the Garden of Eden is the kind of meeting place
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.040]   between God and his image bearers.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.520]   And so then they start pointing out
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.720]   many, many adumbrations of kind of temple theology
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.280]   that's already beginning to take place in the garden.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.520]   And if you want to, you can point out
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.440]   that the word temple isn't used.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.600]   But nevertheless, the adumbrations,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.880]   the first steps toward this sort of thing
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.960]   are already built right into the Genesis one, two, three
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.800]   account.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.000]   And if I had time, I could show you
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.680]   that there are about a dozen of these themes
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.360]   that are already built right into the structure of things.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.260]   I'll mention one more just in passing.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.760]   The word king is not used.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   God presenting himself as king.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.360]   Yet there's no doubt that he reigns.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.320]   He reigns over that which he has made.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   And so the notion of God as king
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.240]   is built into the storyline.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.720]   Then in the seventh place,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   human beings are introduced made in the image of God.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   That becomes a major theme that runs right
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.400]   through the entire scripture.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.600]   God makes human beings in his own image and likeness.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.560]   So that in some ways, they're very much like
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.940]   the rest of creation made by God out of the dust.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.080]   And in other ways, they're unique.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.480]   And it would be, it would well be worth our while
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   to tease out some of the things that are bound up
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.440]   with this notion of image of God.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.240]   One of the reasons why Christians have such a hard job
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.800]   agreeing on exactly what goes into this notion
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.200]   is because once again,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.520]   I think that it's a pregnant expression.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.320]   It's an expression that adumbrates what will be filled out
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.040]   in much more detail in subsequent chapters,
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.320]   subsequent books that run right through the entire scripture
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.360]   so that human beings are unique creatures.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.920]   On the one hand, we're supposed to reflect God,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.620]   where his image, and on the other hand,
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.960]   we too belong to the dust, we're made from the dust,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.360]   we're part of the created order
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.560]   and not to be confused with God.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   So this sort of created order is extraordinarily important.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.420]   Then in the eighth place,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.200]   there is stewardship over creation.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   In the ninth place, there is, in Genesis 2,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.360]   a kind of ordering and structure.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.000]   In chapter one, verses 26 and 27,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.760]   "Let us make humankind in our image."
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   So men and women are both made equally in the image of God,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.960]   but in a kind of binary way.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.760]   There's a male and a female,
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.120]   and both of them are made in the image of God.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.000]   In chapter two, then the account of creation
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.240]   is teased out in greater detail
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.020]   so that one is made first and the other is made for the one.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.500]   That is, Adam is made first and she is made from him,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.240]   thus part of humankind, and for him,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.760]   in a way that is unique.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.720]   It's not a reciprocal relationship at that point.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   So men and women gets teased out in a variety of ways,
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.400]   and that's part of the setup, likewise,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   for the account of the fall.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.160]   And those sorts of things are teased out
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.920]   in terms of man-woman relationships
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.520]   later on in Scripture, too.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.320]   First Corinthians 11, First Timothy 2, and elsewhere.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.520]   Then, I think we're about the 10th place.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.720]   There is eschatology that is anticipated by all of this.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.480]   It's not for nothing that the prophet Isaiah,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   in the eighth century, anticipates that
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.500]   what God will do at the end for his people
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.720]   is provide a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   And that language is full of anticipation
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.580]   and glory of what is yet to be revealed,
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.400]   and finally it shows up in Revelation 21,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.000]   but it's harking back to the first creation.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.960]   And even when the expression,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.520]   new heaven and new earth does not occur,
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.200]   as it does in Revelation 21 or 2 Peter and so forth,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.740]   yet the theme is bound up with the details
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.060]   of Romans 8, for example.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.780]   The whole created order is subjected to death and decay
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.220]   by God's decree because of sin and rebellion,
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.340]   and it groans, waiting for the adoption of sons.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.100]   That is the culmination of the glorification of believers.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.100]   So that anticipates the Bible storyline in huge ways.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.060]   Two more, the beginning of Sabbath
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.100]   is bound up with God's rest.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.100]   The text does not say that Sabbath is imposed at this point.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.360]   It says that God rests on the seventh day,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   but when the Sabbath is instituted legally in the Decalogue,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.520]   the text self-consciously looks back to creation.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   You are to remember the seventh day and keep it holy
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.780]   for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.220]   and so on, so on, so on.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.420]   So that is picked up likewise,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.580]   even in Revelation 4 to build a whole theology of rest
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.500]   that we can't tease out at this juncture,
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.780]   but it begins in the opening chapters of Genesis.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.700]   And finally, this is not an exhaustive list,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.500]   but an apostolic number will do for us.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.540]   There is a huge emphasis in the rest of the Bible
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.260]   on the greatness of God testified by his creation.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:10.740]   You think of passages like Psalm 8 or Psalm 19
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:16.020]   worth reading at this juncture
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   and meditating quietly on them,
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.020]   or some of the spectacular texts in Isaiah 40 to 45.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.980]   Reading through those chapters reminds us
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.340]   that God is sovereign over creation,
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.260]   knows the end from the beginning,
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.140]   and everything is accountable to him.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.300]   He's the sovereign pottery maker.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.820]   The created order is simply what he makes.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.140]   So texts like Isaiah 40, verse 12,
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.140]   Isaiah 43, 15, chunks of Isaiah 44, verses 2 and 24,
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.980]   Isaiah 45, 11 and 12, and so on.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.920]   These are texts that call us back to worship God
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.640]   because of his greatness and the display
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.700]   of his own glory in creation,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.920]   which is a point that is also found in Romans 1.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.580]   God has not left himself with witness
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.240]   because his existence and glory are already displayed
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.220]   in the created order itself.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.400]   So in other words, Genesis 1, 2, and 3,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   I haven't even mentioned much about the fall,
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.540]   but Genesis 1 and 2 and the focus on creation
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.000]   is itself the seedbed of a vast number
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.620]   of biblical theological themes
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.560]   that tell us a great deal about God,
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.680]   human beings, the structure of the storyline
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.080]   that issues finally in the coming of Christ
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.620]   and in the denouement of all things,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.300]   issuing in the glory that is yet to come
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.880]   in the new heaven and the new earth.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.800]   - Yeah, huge implications indeed.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.080]   Thank you, Dr. Carson.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.480]   - Good, blessings on you, Tony.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.760]   - Our Friday phone call with Dr. Don Carson
