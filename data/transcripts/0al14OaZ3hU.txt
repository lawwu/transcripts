[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   It was meant to be a piece that shone a little bit of light on how Musk operates
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.600]   and his willingness to flout the rules and his reliance on government subsidies,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.600]   despite the fact that he presents himself as this libertarian free market, free
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.760]   marketeer, and his willingness to lie to, to, to, on some level, enrich himself,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.880]   which also runs counter to the Elon Musk narrative that he doesn't care about
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.760]   making money for himself, because the main reason for Tesla to buy SolarCity
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.080]   was that SolarCity had, was that Tesla, was that SolarCity had, that, that
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.400]   Musk and his, and his, and his relatives had extended these loans to SolarCity
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.040]   that were going to go bank, that were going to be, all the money was going to
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.680]   be lost if SolarCity went bankrupt.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.880]   And by having Tesla buy it, Musk was able to bail himself out as, as, as well.
