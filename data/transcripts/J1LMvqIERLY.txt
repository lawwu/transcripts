[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   Why do you pay the CEO so much more than all the next level down?
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.780]   Is he really that much better than the second best guy?
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.280]   And it's like, look, this isn't just incentivizing the CEO, it's incentivizing everyone who's there,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.620]   who could plausibly tell themselves, "Maybe one day, me."
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.880]   So there's that.
