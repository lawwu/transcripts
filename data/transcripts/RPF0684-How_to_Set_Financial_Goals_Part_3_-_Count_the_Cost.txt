[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.240]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.320]   Today in the show we continue our financial goal setting series, how to set financial
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.600]   goals and we're going to talk today about counting the cost.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.360]   Before you start something, you've got to count the cost and don't begin until you count
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.600]   the cost.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.520]   For who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.160]   if there's enough money to finish it?
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   There are two components that I want to talk to you about today, the financial cost and
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.560]   the opportunity cost.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.520]   But basically it works like this.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.240]   When you set a goal for yourself, that goal is going to involve a price tag in order for
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880]   it to be achieved.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.640]   In the first show in the series, I used the quote by oil billionaire H.L. Hunt who famously
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.160]   said that in America you only need the two things to be successful.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.600]   First to decide exactly what you want and then second to determine the price you're
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.400]   going to have to pay to get it and then to resolve to pay that price.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   And goal setting is as simple as that.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.240]   You decide what you want, you determine the price that you'll have to pay to get it and
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.300]   then resolve to pay that price.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.880]   Now that quote as I applied it in the first show in the series is well applied to any
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.200]   goal, even those goals that have only a peripheral connection to finances.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.700]   Something like I want to lower my body fat by an extra 50 pounds.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.240]   You count the cost of what's going to have to be required and you do it.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.840]   And although there may be some financial component to it, perhaps changing the amount of money
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   that you spend on food or perhaps purchasing some kind of coaching or exercise, access
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.660]   to a gym, something like that.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.380]   Those costs are more peripheral.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.240]   But most of our goals involve costs that are more direct.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.820]   Much more direct.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.580]   Our goals could be things like consumption goals.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.900]   Let's say you decide I would really like to buy a different car.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.380]   I'd really like to buy a new car.
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380]   And so you clarify the type of vehicle that you want to buy and then count the cost.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.560]   I would recommend to you that the first thing you should do is trot out and start doing
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.620]   research on the car.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.660]   Go to the dealership if there's one handy to you.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.960]   Sit in the car, look at it, get the brochures and go through them and find out what it costs
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.940]   because then you can know what this thing is going to cost me if I set this as a goal.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.580]   You need to know that.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.700]   And that experience can be useful.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.780]   If you want to buy a house, whether it's a new house to live in of a certain quality
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.260]   or variety or whether it's a rental house of some kind, then you need to go out and
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.620]   start looking at the houses.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.620]   You can do this digitally.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.960]   Look around your county and see what houses cost.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.760]   See what they're going to rent for.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.380]   Go out and drive around and look at some.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.380]   Go to some open houses.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.140]   Tour some homes, etc.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.860]   Knowing what something costs is a basic first step because then by having those numbers
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.900]   in your head, you'll start to understand what's required.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.060]   Now you might find a pleasant surprise.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.300]   One of the things that I find fascinating in some of the work that I do is how many
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.140]   people have big dreams about what they want to do and yet when they start counting the
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.560]   cost of that, actually financially counting the cost because they start to move forward
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.060]   towards that goal achievement, they find out that to achieve that certain thing can be
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.900]   far cheaper than they ever imagined.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.020]   My favorite example here is travel.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.260]   I've heard time and time again from financial planning clients, "When we retire, we want
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   to travel.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.420]   We want to travel the world."
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.860]   Awesome.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.300]   But my experience, the vast majority of people who say they want to do that don't really
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.820]   know how much traveling the world costs.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.980]   Now I'm not saying they don't travel, but they don't understand how much traveling the
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.980]   world actually costs because they're not actively doing it now.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.660]   There's no reason why you have to wait until retirement to travel the world if you really
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.240]   want to travel.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.380]   Day in, day out, you will find today in 2019, 2020, you will find couples traveling the
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.340]   world for less than $30,000 per year between the two of them, individuals less than $20,000
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.340]   per year.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.740]   And that's not hyper budget travel.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.700]   That might not be the most extravagant travel, might not always be staying at a five-star
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.500]   hotel travel, but it's not super budget travel either.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.860]   And so if somebody wants to go and travel the world, it can be as simple as figuring
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.220]   out how to create an income that supports them on the road or simply saving the money.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.500]   If you got a job making $40,000 a year and you can live on 20,000 and save 20,000, well,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.940]   now you can go travel the world for a year.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.180]   Or if you can figure out how to make an income of $55 a day from the road, you can afford
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   to travel the world.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.220]   There are all kinds of things you can do with just some hourly work online for $30 an hour,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.860]   two hours a day of work on the road per day and your budget is met.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.860]   Now you can go and travel the world.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.460]   And so when you count the costs, sometimes you find that things are far cheaper than
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.340]   you ever imagined they would be.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.380]   And that can be wonderful because it can help you to see how to achieve something much faster.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.980]   Let's say my goal is to drive an exotic supercar.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.700]   Well, the price tag might be $400,000 or you might look down and say, "How much does it
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.580]   cost for me to lease one?"
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.420]   Here you can lease a Lamborghini for under $3,000 a month.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.100]   So if that's your thing, you may be able to accomplish it much faster when you start looking
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.420]   at options.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.380]   Which of us hasn't actually experienced how effective the salesman is at trying to show
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.260]   us how we can get into that new car today?
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.100]   You go to count the costs, thinking about buying the new $65,000 SUV and all of a sudden
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.660]   you find out from your $682 a month you can be driving out today.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.220]   Well, it's a lot easier.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.700]   If you really want to drive that SUV, it becomes pretty easy when it's broken down into that
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.860]   monthly payment amount.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   You go and you look at the house and you count the costs and all of a sudden now you realize
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.580]   mortgage payment is $2,200 a month.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.620]   I can afford that.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.980]   So count the cost.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.980]   Now we do need to stop in the middle of our decision making process and carefully use
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.020]   logic and analysis, see what we're giving up, etc. before we take action.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.420]   We don't want to just be emotionally impulsed into doing something because it sounds easy.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   Talk about what you're giving up in a moment.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.180]   But some things are dramatically cheaper to do than you would think and you know that
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.380]   by starting to count the cost.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.820]   The image that just always sticks with me as the very best expression of this is Chris
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.100]   Guillebeau's story of when he sat down and decided to visit every country.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.980]   Oh, I think it was that he wanted to start with 100 countries and he sat down and he
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.300]   was figuring out how much it would cost him to visit 100 countries and his calculations
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.040]   were that it would probably cost him about $33,000 to visit 100 countries.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.540]   So he thought, "Well, that's not unreasonable.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.540]   Lots of people buy $33,000 cars.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.180]   I'd rather just simply visit 100 countries."
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.460]   So when you sit down and start looking at numbers and start pricing things out, start
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.420]   considering scenarios, you may quickly find out that something is far more achievable
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.180]   than you ever thought possible.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.100]   So get that data.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.100]   Look into it.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.100]   Study it.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   Go online.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   Do your internet research.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.220]   See what other people are paying for this goal that you've set.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.600]   And you may be pleasantly surprised to find out that you can achieve a goal far faster
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.140]   than you ever thought.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.060]   Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why it may be important to you to be careful how
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.980]   you set your goals.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.260]   Example, you might set a goal, "I want to drive a new car.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.100]   I want to buy a new car."
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.580]   But if you don't clarify how you want to buy the new car, you might wind up down at the
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.600]   dealership, drive out with the car and that new car could be a chain around your neck
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.900]   for the next six years until you get the payments paid off.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.280]   What I like to do is, when setting goals, think about how I can comfortably afford to
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:09.700]   buy something fun without sacrificing my financial goals, especially my wealth accumulation goals.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.380]   So what I like to do is if I'm going to have an extravagant consumption item, an extravagant
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.620]   consumption purchase, for me those things are usually more experiences rather than stuff,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.740]   then I want to look at it and say, "How can I position this as a reward so I will simultaneously
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.940]   get wealthy and get this thing?"
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:38.740]   So just to get the image in your head, instead of saying, "I want to buy a new car," I would
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:46.060]   say, "I want to buy this specific car with the monthly profit from this new line of business,"
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:53.780]   or "I want to buy this specific car with the monthly profit from my new rental house."
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:00.380]   So my goal is now to buy a new rental house, get it rented out, with enough excess cash
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.540]   flow to pay the car payment for me on this particular car.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.460]   Then while I'm driving the car, I can feel relaxed and enjoy the consumption expense
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.260]   knowing that I haven't sacrificed my wealth goals.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.380]   Because when you start counting the cost of goals, you see that sometimes they interact.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.140]   I want to be financially independent in 10 years, but I also want to drive a Lamborghini.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.660]   Well, financial independence doesn't come from Lamborghinis.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.380]   Lamborghinis might be part of your total financial abundance, but you first got to start with
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.140]   accumulating the money.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.980]   And I would a whole lot rather have the Lamborghini after being financially independent than the
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.640]   Lamborghini first.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.020]   Your mileage may vary, but count the cost and then stop and think and analyze.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.340]   Now on the flip side, when you start looking at things, some things may cost way more to
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.800]   do than you would think.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.980]   And you might just decide, "I'm not interested in this," in which case you can just toss
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.660]   it away.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.180]   Years ago when I was younger, I really wanted to buy a Harley Davidson.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.420]   I enjoyed riding motorcycles.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.060]   I really wanted to buy a Harley Davidson.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.740]   So I set it as a goal.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.420]   By this date, I will own a black Harley Davidson.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.700]   I specified it all out.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   I can't remember at this point.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.140]   It was the Road King or something.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.180]   I wanted to be a bagger on the back, but not the top case.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   I liked those.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.180]   I rented one from the Harley Davidson dealership one time.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.420]   I was like, "By this date, I'm going to have a Harley Davidson."
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.120]   Then I went, I counted the cost on it, and I opened the savings account with the name
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.980]   on the account, Harley Davidson.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.500]   I started funding it.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.940]   Over time, I just realized, "You know what?
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.700]   I don't actually care about this goal.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.860]   This is not actually my goal."
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.780]   It was a consumption goal that somebody talked me into setting.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.540]   I was reading some book, and they talked about setting goals.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.500]   I put it as a goal, and I realized, "No, I don't really care about that."
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.020]   So I closed the account and moved the money elsewhere.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.220]   That's really nice, because now you can just give up on a goal because, "That's not actually
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.980]   my goal."
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.180]   A lot better to know that quickly so that you can change quickly than to spend years
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.240]   chasing a goal that's not really yours.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   You might not choose to throw away a goal, but you might choose to modify a goal.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.780]   For example, my Harley Davidson would have been absurdly expensive.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.720]   I can't remember now, but maybe $25,000 for the exact top-of-the-line bike that I wanted.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.180]   But there's no reason to buy a $25,000 bike if your goal is just to have a motorcycle.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.900]   A $2,000 motorcycle would work great in most situations.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.220]   You set the goal and realize, "It's just not worth it to me.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:42.500]   I'm not willing to work and save and experience all the other costs of that $25,000 goal when
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.220]   I could have 80% of the benefit for $2,000."
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.100]   Some things cost way more than you think, and you can figure that out quickly when you
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.160]   start counting the financial cost.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   Count the cost.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.640]   When you set a goal, count the cost.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.820]   We've talked about the financial cost, but financial costs are not the most important
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   costs.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:12.700]   And the reason is because money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.340]   You can always get more money.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.180]   You can always create more money.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.760]   You can almost always earn more money.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.860]   So money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.500]   But there's one other resource that is the ultimate non-renewable resource, and that
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.700]   is time.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.620]   Time is the ultimate non-renewable resource.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:43.700]   And time is usually what's involved in our second area of cost, which is the opportunity
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.660]   cost.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.900]   What is the opportunity cost of your goal that you're setting?
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:56.980]   Opportunity cost is what are you giving up in order for you to pursue or to achieve this
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   goal?
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.780]   What will you be giving up?
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:08.300]   Now these opportunity costs are a little bit harder to quantify, but they are no less real
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.500]   simply because they're harder to quantify.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.080]   The fact that they're harder to figure out and harder to put a specific dollar figure
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.500]   on doesn't make them any less real.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.100]   And as time marches forward, you'll find that you can't do everything equally well, so you're
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.140]   going to have to give something up.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.820]   And as time marches forward, that's the non-renewable resource that you'll never get back.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.980]   So when you set a goal, you've got to be very careful that you really believe in that goal
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:45.460]   and that that goal itself is not going to cost you something very important.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:51.000]   For me, many of the consumption goals that I used to set, I put aside because what I
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.540]   realized I would be giving up was higher goals such as financial freedom or personal freedom
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.620]   or lifestyle freedom.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:06.500]   I valued financial freedom more than I valued achieving the consumption goal.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:13.900]   And frankly, that's basically the core basis of the modern FIRE movement.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.740]   You have people who are basically looking at life and saying, "Well, I could have all
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.900]   these things or I could have all these experiences now.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.620]   I could have these various consumption items.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:37.140]   Or if I don't have these now, I could have financial freedom faster."
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.300]   And so, many people choose to lower their consumption because they want to be financially
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.260]   free faster.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.020]   Now notice the balance here.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.700]   What's the opportunity cost of pursuing financial freedom?
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:16:00.380]   Well, what you give up is you give up experiences now, you give up purchases now in exchange
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.060]   for things later.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.940]   Is that a wise move?
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.860]   Probably depends on the person.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.540]   Probably depends on their goals.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.340]   Probably nobody gets it completely right.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:26.020]   I think if you talk to most hardcore FIRE devotees, I bet you that some of them would
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.700]   look back and say, "I wish I had spent a little bit more here.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:37.140]   I wish I had done that thing 10 years ago or 5 years ago instead of just saving, saving,
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.540]   saving all the time.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.780]   Because now I look back and that's an experience I can't get back.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.620]   Those are years that I can't get back.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.300]   I can't go back and relive that time."
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.740]   But then of course on the flip side, what's much more widespread is you and I at least
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.180]   have probably experienced this and most of our neighbors have, that many people would
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.260]   say, "Oh, I spent lots of money on an experience or lots of money on a thing.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.620]   I wish I could go back and get that back.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:20.220]   I wish I had a little more freedom today by having a little more money in my pocket."
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.820]   I doubt any of us are going to successfully achieve that perfect balance.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.300]   Probably doesn't exist.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:34.560]   But at least by thinking about it carefully and consciously, hopefully we can get a little
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.260]   bit closer toward that ideal balance.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.580]   And the way that you get there is by counting the cost.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.140]   You count the financial cost and you count the opportunity cost.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:52.140]   What will this goal cost me to achieve and what will I give up in order to achieve it?
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.580]   What will I have to stop doing in order to accomplish this goal?
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.300]   What will I have to stop spending money on in order to accumulate the money for this
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.140]   goal?
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:10.700]   What more work will I have to do in order to have the money for this?
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:20.020]   These concepts I'm giving you today are at the core of most of the modern financial conversation,
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.380]   especially the very loud financial conversation that much of this community is involved in
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.180]   relating to financial independence.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.780]   As we sit here at the dawn of a new decade, or I guess the eve of a new decade would be
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:38.220]   more accurate, as we sit here at the eve of a new decade and consider forward 10 years,
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:46.460]   my goal is that this be the decade that you achieve financial freedom.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.580]   That's my goal for you.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:55.620]   So following this formula that I have given to you here, we have to talk about what does
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.180]   freedom mean to you?
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.940]   What does financial freedom mean to you?
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:05.060]   That's what is the financial cost of financial freedom?
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.260]   Your number may be rather modest.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:14.660]   You might recognize that if you can accumulate $10,000, you'll be in the top half of probably
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:20.220]   Western society, at least American society, given that you could lay your hands on $10,000.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.400]   Well, that's a very doable goal.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.620]   Your number might be far higher.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:32.260]   Your number might be $5 million, and your target is to lay your hands on $5 million
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.540]   in order to achieve financial freedom.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.900]   There be numbers far higher, far lower, but sit down and count the cost of what financial
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.060]   freedom means to you.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.060]   But then you have to sit down and think about the opportunity cost.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:56.500]   What will I be giving up to achieve financial freedom?
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:02.140]   Now I'll just give you a little bit from my brain, a little bit from my story, and then
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.940]   you can use it as fodder to achieve whatever you want to achieve.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.300]   And feel free to disagree with me, agree with me, it doesn't really matter.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.580]   Just go through the process for yourself and then hopefully make some intentional decisions
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.980]   for your situation.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.580]   But here's how I tackled this problem.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.760]   For me, my target has always been financial freedom.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.940]   I want to have financial freedom.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.620]   That's the goal.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.780]   Lifestyle freedom.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.180]   Freedom is a big deal for me.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.420]   Freedom in all of its variations and permutations.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.780]   And so when I ask myself the why, why do I want financial freedom?
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:47.340]   Well, some of the things that happen for me, some of the things that are important to me,
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.460]   are things like freedom over my time.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.940]   I like to be in control of my time.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.140]   I like to feel like I don't have to be somewhere at a certain time.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.900]   I like to feel like I don't have to go somewhere at a certain time.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.820]   I like to have control over my time.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.300]   It's always been a dream of mine.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.340]   When I sit down and imagine my perfect day, my perfect day is never involved in the alarm
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.380]   clock going off.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.440]   So control over my time.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.780]   Other things that financial freedom means to me, means control over who I associate
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.240]   with.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:25.480]   In my opinion, freedom of association is one of the most basic of fundamental human rights
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.120]   that most people never think to capture for themselves.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.200]   And yet we all have it.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.380]   Unless you're a slave in chains, you have freedom of association.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.780]   One of the, I'll skip the rant, freedom of association.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.980]   One of the things that's important to me is freedom of speech.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.800]   The ability to say what I want to say and to be accountable for my words.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.320]   Freedom of speech.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:03.280]   So these are different aspects of freedom that for me are important.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.120]   So now we come back to financial freedom.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   Goal, financial freedom.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.240]   I have some numerical targets associated with that.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.400]   But we start counting the cost.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.160]   What is the financial cost of financial freedom?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.620]   Let me use some numbers to put some math on this.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:28.320]   In my opinion, the sweet spot for financial freedom is a starting point for an abundant
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:36.080]   and free financial life is somewhere between $6,000 to $12,000 a month.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.040]   Median income in the United States, something in the $50,000 to $60,000 range.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:47.680]   There's research that indicates that $70,000 is kind of a sweet point of happiness, of
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.160]   earnings, is a sweet point of happiness.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.480]   From some perspective, after taxes, you wind up in that $5,000 or $6,000 a month range.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.120]   I think many people can live comfortably on $5,000 to $6,000 a month.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.640]   What you miss out on in that budget, and this would depend if you're a single person, married
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.480]   couple, married with children, what you miss out on that budget is some of the experiences
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.440]   that are really fun and expensive.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.240]   The weekend trip to New York City to take in a show or two and enjoy the Christmas cheer
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.460]   in New York City.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.960]   Is it totally extravagant?
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.360]   No, it's not that extravagant, but it'll still cost you $6,000.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.320]   The week ski trip, the European vacation, the cruise, those kinds of things.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:37.640]   If your tastes are simpler and they run to reading quietly around the firelight and book
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:44.760]   club discussions in downtown Toronto, etc., then of course you don't need as much money.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.120]   If you have many children as I do, and if you really prefer the idea of time in Europe
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.600]   and Broadway musicals and taking your children on interesting experiences, etc., then of
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.640]   course you increase your budget numbers.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:08.360]   But I think somewhere in that $6,000 to $12,000 a month range is really in many ways an ideal
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   number for many people.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.860]   I've done budget analyses.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.280]   Most people don't ever sit down when counting the cost and talk about what they can actually
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.280]   spend money on.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.920]   Years ago I did a show called Why You Should Probably Lower Your Financial Goals.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.460]   Got a lot of great feedback from that show where I went through different budgets and
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.220]   talked about how when you get to the higher dollar amounts, it's actually really hard
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.680]   to spend money.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.360]   Many people set very high financial goals without ever sitting down and thinking about
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.120]   what to actually spend the money on.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.520]   Let's just say that your number is $8,000 a month as just a plug number here.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.500]   You multiply 8 times 12 and you say, "My goal is to spend $96,000 per year and let's round
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.060]   it up to $100,000 for easy podcast math.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.600]   My goal is $100,000 per year."
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.320]   Then you sit down and you begin with the 4% rule.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.040]   Let's go with the 3% rule for safety.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.800]   You multiply 100,000 times 30 and now you know your number is $3 million.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.040]   Could be $2.5 million, could be $3 million, but you got a range and an expectation of
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.280]   how much money you would need to save to accomplish that particular goal.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.240]   You look at your savings rate and you calculate.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.280]   Maybe you're saving $3,000 a month.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.560]   It's going to take you quite a while to get there at $3,000 a month.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.040]   You start working on variations.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.680]   Now, when I went through this for myself and I thought about what was important, I thought
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   about the extreme savings.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.480]   At the time that I first started working through this stuff, I had a high income, I had a good
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.760]   job, my own business, etc.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.200]   But when I looked it through, I realized that for me, I didn't have to depend on purely
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   finances just to accomplish freedom, but that for me, I could accomplish most of my why,
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.400]   my freedom, by just simply transitioning to a different kind of business.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:04.440]   And that that could be a lot faster way of achieving what I wanted to achieve.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.820]   That may not be the same for you.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.000]   If you sit down and you look at your job and you say, "If I work this job for three more
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.540]   years saving at my current rate, I'll be in a situation where I can achieve my personal
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.940]   financial goals."
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.520]   In which case, a sensible position would be for you to work at your job.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.680]   Now, remember, of course, also we could play with the investment numbers.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.840]   You sit down and you say, "All right, in order for me to generate $8,000 per month, I would
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.760]   probably need in my local area, I probably need six rental houses.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.680]   And if I had six rental houses paid off, then I could achieve that goal."
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.560]   So you start buying rental houses.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.520]   But you calculate the number.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.800]   You think about the why.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.600]   Then you think about what you give up.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.640]   So when I went through the opportunity cost analysis, realized that I could achieve financial
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.360]   freedom in a number of different ways.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.960]   One way was by continuing in the business I was in at that time.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.820]   And it wouldn't have taken that long for financial freedom, but it still would have been a number
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.320]   of years.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.480]   Significant, not insignificant number of years.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.200]   Well, when looking at it, here's the problem.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.480]   Money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.720]   Time is the ultimate non-renewable resource.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.880]   If somebody really doesn't want to work and they want to be free, then of course, you've
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.760]   got to become totally financially free so you can live on the income from your portfolio.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.800]   But if you just want something like I did with freedom, and you like working and you
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.360]   intend to always work, for me, I will always work.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.520]   I'll never retire.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.880]   Because I believe that work is important.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.120]   Some of the most important contributions we make to the world are in our work.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.240]   And so work will always work.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.400]   Now if you work for money, great.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.440]   If you don't want to work for money, don't charge money.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.240]   That's your prerogative.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.720]   But work is something I'll always do.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:06.680]   And so I was able to achieve one level of financial freedom fairly quickly by seeking
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.320]   to build ways to earn an income and support myself through building a different business,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.840]   a business that would allow me freedom.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.240]   And I'm grateful to be able to do that.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.400]   Very blessed.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.440]   Talk with my wife frequently.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.120]   Just last night we were talking about, I was talking to her about going into a different
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.800]   line of business and we were brainstorming it out.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.920]   This other line of business could be extremely profitable.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   Something that I knew well.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.840]   We were talking about opportunities and numbers, etc.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.240]   I just said, "I can't give up the freedom."
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.960]   I cannot imagine a better situation than I have now.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.800]   I'm not willing to give up the freedom.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.320]   With all of the hardship, with all the things that are difficult at the moment, I'm not
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:54.560]   willing to give up the freedom in order to go back into less freedom in the other situation.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.280]   Now don't copy me unless my situation is similar to yours, but do the analysis.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.920]   I've done this type of analysis for people and the answer is, "Well, what I'll do is
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.720]   I'll keep a job as a firefighter or as a teacher or enjoy or work till I get my military pension."
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:19.360]   Because what I get is something valuable that gives me a baseline level of freedom and what
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.920]   I give up is not something that is particularly bad for me to give up.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.540]   The opportunity cost for somebody who wants to be a firefighter, for example, I've always
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.840]   thought it's a pretty cool job, say, "What's the great cost of my being a firefighter?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.080]   I like what I do.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.400]   I like the schedule.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.840]   I feel like it's important.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.520]   I feel like it's a service.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.680]   I enjoy the physical work.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.800]   Gives me a great income now that I have lots of time to enjoy.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   I get a great pension, which really helps my plan for financial independence and financial
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   freedom."
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.240]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   And so I give up a little bit of freedom now.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:00.560]   I give up a little bit of flexibility now, but I get all these other benefits.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.640]   Go for it.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.460]   Do your own analysis.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.160]   But as you work through this process, this is the analytical process that you can apply
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.040]   to your own situation to try to come up with the best solution for you.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.840]   Set a goal.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.880]   Dream a big dream.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.580]   Think about the price you'll have to pay for that dream.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.440]   And the clearer that you can get that goal, the clearer you can get that dream, the easier
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.740]   your plan will be.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.760]   Think about why this is important to you.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.840]   If your why is big enough, I can promise you, you will find a way to achieve it.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   Then think about different how, different levels of how.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   How can you do this?
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.160]   What are the opportunities that you have?
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.680]   How can you do this in a more efficient way?
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.040]   How can you do this now?
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.900]   Get your creative juices going.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.880]   Count the cost carefully.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.680]   Count the financial cost.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.520]   Work through different ways of looking at it.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.640]   Look at the budgets.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.800]   Think about the math.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.820]   And count the opportunity cost.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:08.400]   What will you have to give up by pursuing this goal?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.680]   Then we work towards the next step.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.760]   But that will be in another show.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.360]   As I go today, I want to make an announcement and give you a plug here.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.960]   Over the last couple of weeks since my Black Friday sale, I've been totally inundated with
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.360]   doing consulting work.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.840]   And it has been awesome.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.280]   Really really awesome.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   I forgot how much I enjoyed doing financial planning and consulting.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.200]   With a lot of extensive travel, new children and whatnot, I couldn't keep a calendar.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.920]   And I'd have people reach out to me like, "I'm sorry, I can't even commit to a calendar
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.360]   appointment because everything was just so haywire."
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.960]   But at this point, I've gotten my life back onto a smooth, more disciplined track, etc.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.240]   Things are functioning very smoothly and so now I can keep a calendar.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.980]   And so as I've opened this up, it's been just awesome.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.640]   It's been absolutely awesome.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.520]   And I so enjoy it.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.320]   You are the best listener in the world.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.120]   I've got the coolest listeners.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.040]   I'm frankly intimidated by so many of you.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.680]   And I wonder like, "Why is this person coming to me?"
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   I just want to, you know, I always give one of my pieces of advice is go to people and
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.800]   ask them for advice and ask them what's worked for them.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.160]   And more than half of my consulting clients, my impulse is just to say, "Listen, can I
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.400]   interview for Radical Personal Finance so I can share your story with the world because
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   we want to learn from you.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.440]   I don't have anything to teach.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   Let's just learn from you."
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.460]   It's been so great.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.840]   But it's so energizing to me and motivating to me because I love it.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:54.540]   So one of the decisions that I have made is here in 2020, I'm going to dedicate a significant
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.640]   part of my weekly schedule to doing some consulting work.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.000]   And it's going to be a regular thing.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.120]   And primarily for me, one of the biggest costs, back to opportunity cost, right?
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.240]   This still fits into the content of today's show.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.880]   One of the biggest costs that I have found of leaving a more traditional corporate environment
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.760]   is the solitude.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   I don't want to use the word loneliness because I'm not lonely.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.920]   I have a vibrant social network, a vibrant family life.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.600]   I'm not lonely.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.960]   But it is a form of solitude and I miss the camaraderie of the office environment.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.080]   I miss the, I miss it.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.280]   I miss that sense of being on a team, that sense of purpose.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.060]   Now, of course, I'm leading my own team and seeking to build that.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.640]   But because I've chosen to do what I do virtually, I don't get to enjoy those same benefits
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.180]   of the coffee pot chatter and things like that.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.040]   It's really a big benefit of working.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.720]   My sister, you always used to say that she went to work just to see her friends every
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.040]   day and I thought she was silly for saying that.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.840]   But I understand more now what she was saying that I didn't understand back then.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:16.800]   And so the consulting work has been so encouraging for me to really tap into that same context.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.860]   And on about, I would say, 98%, I've had one or two calls where I went through it and I
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.720]   wasn't able to give some, necessarily anything that I thought was breakthrough, primarily
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.120]   because those clients are just doing really, really well.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.480]   But on the vast majority of the calls, maybe 90%, too much, maybe 95%, I don't know.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.280]   The vast majority of the calls, we've been able to work together and come up with some
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:45.800]   really good ideas to substantially improve the speed of goal achievement.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.880]   And so I love that.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.880]   I feel good.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.960]   And it gives me so much better feedback.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.680]   One of the great challenges of podcasting, due to the way that you're listening to me
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.740]   right now, it makes it hard for you to give me feedback.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.260]   You're listening to me while you drive the car or while you walk the dog or while you
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.800]   run in the treadmill or while you wash the dishes.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.680]   And due to that, it's hard for you to reach out to me.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.560]   Your hands are covered in soapy water.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.800]   You have to dry them and go get the phone and tap out on some dumb little keyboard,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   an email to me.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.160]   And I appreciate it when you do that, but it's hard.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.640]   Whereas when I speak live in person, voice to voice in real time, two-way synchronous
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.560]   communication, it's just so great.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.920]   We can have instant feedback and we can adjust the ideas and everything can change quickly.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.360]   And so that has been really, really awesome.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.960]   So I'm going to do a lot more of it.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.080]   I'm going to do 10 hours a week, no more than that, but I'm going to do 10 hours a week
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   during 2020.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.220]   So I would invite you.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:46.920]   If you would like to engage in a personal consulting call with me, reach out to me and
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.560]   send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:56.280]   And I want to tell you this, here's my biggest disappointment of the consulting calls that
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.200]   I have done over the last couple of weeks.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:09.360]   The vast majority of my consulting clients, I didn't sit down and calculate the numbers,
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.200]   so I'm just going with the gut here, 70 or 80%.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.920]   The vast majority of my consulting clients are already rich.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.280]   I've only had a handful of people who were either in tough situations or who were just
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.040]   getting started, et cetera.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.140]   And friends, it ought not to be that way.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.120]   And yet it is.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.880]   It ought not to be that way.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   And yet it is.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.560]   Even some of the consulting clients who were in that just getting started in a difficult
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.680]   situation or in debt and how do we adjust this, we were able to come up with some really
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.360]   good solutions.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:52.320]   In one case, I think, I don't need to go through, some really good solutions.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.440]   But the vast majority of my consulting clients are already rich.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.120]   I would guess, I don't keep client records, so I'm not going to go through and do that.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.880]   I guard my client's privacy very zealously.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.600]   I shred my notes as soon as I'm done.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:12.000]   But I would guess that the median net worth of the consulting clients of that top 80%
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.500]   is probably about $3 million.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.980]   Don't need my help, but still just looking for, is there a way to optimize?
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.240]   Is there a way to improve?
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.180]   Et cetera.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:32.000]   If you're just getting started, if you are, if you're just getting started, you should
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.640]   start with the information that is the cheapest.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.640]   You should get books and read books.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.760]   You should listen to podcasts that are free.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:46.280]   But you can dramatically speed up your time if you consult an expert.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.440]   You've listened to me for hundreds of hours.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.920]   And in that time, you can assess whether you think I can help you or not.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.960]   If you don't think I can help you, go and find somebody who can and get some help to
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.240]   speed up your results.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:10.360]   If you think I can help you, email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, and I'll help you.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:16.440]   One of the things, by the way, I'm a big proponent of voluntary exchange.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.400]   I have this thing that I tell consulting clients.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.800]   If you don't think I was worth it, don't pay me.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.440]   I don't ever want somebody to not feel like they were worth it.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.920]   Thus far, every consulting client I've ever had has paid me.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   I'm a big believer in stand up and lead with value first.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.320]   But I plead with you.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.040]   My email box should have been filled.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.840]   The deal that I offered for Black Friday was insanely cheap.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.880]   I've raised my prices for next year.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.240]   And I knew, just I was like, "Okay, I'll get back in the rhythm of I'll offer big sale."
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.560]   And I'm so grateful that so many of you responded.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.800]   But my deal that I offered on Black Friday was insanely cheap.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.920]   And it should have been 80% filled with people who are just getting started.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.680]   Because often, you can make, as a consultant and as a coach, you can make the biggest difference
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.300]   with somebody who's just getting started to clarify something, etc.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.160]   And I loved doing the work that I've done over the last couple of weeks, helping very
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   wealthy people.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.960]   But I want to help unwealthy people too.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.040]   I want to speed up your results.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.840]   So remember this.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.640]   Over the years, one of the things that has served me the best, and this is entirely self-serving
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.120]   because I'm talking to you in the context of an ad, it's still true.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.320]   One of the things that has been most helpful for me is to get and pay for the very best
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.160]   advice I can get and pay for.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:48.960]   And that speeds up your results because it saves you time.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.240]   Money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.800]   Time is the ultimate non-renewable resource.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.160]   And we go through phases in life.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.640]   When you're just getting started, you have no money and tons of time.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.320]   And so you value the money more than the time.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   As you get older, you start to value the time far more than the money.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.440]   Only you know where you are in that process.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:14.000]   But one of the best things you can do to improve your performance is seek out the best advice
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.800]   that you can get.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   I think I'll do a...
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.960]   I'm adding this to my list to do before the end of the year, but I'm going to give in
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.640]   the next week after I finish this goal-setting series, I'm going to give you a series on
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.040]   financial goals that I think you should set.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.200]   One of those goals is to choose an amount of your income to invest back into yourself.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:42.000]   It is dumb for you to save 10% of your income into your 401(k) if you're not also investing
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.680]   10% of your income back into yourself.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.680]   Or 5%.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.640]   You just don't know the right number.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.480]   But you've got to invest back into yourself.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.400]   And so when you're earning in the early years, those numbers are small.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.960]   You invest in yourself by buying books.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.440]   You invest in yourself by buying courses.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.400]   You invest in yourself by getting just a little bit of help here and there from somebody.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   And then as it grows, you hire better and better coaches, better and better consultants,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.880]   and you move up and up and up.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.680]   And that's what speeds up your results.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:20.160]   So I just want to tell you, I'm booked for the rest of December, but I'm committing 10
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.280]   hours a week, starting in January, all through 2020, 10 hours a week to doing consulting
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   work.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.120]   If you're interested in that, email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.800]   I'll give you the details.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:40.480]   But you will find it to be one of the most valuable things that you can possibly do if
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.040]   you care about getting results quickly.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.960]   It's important.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   It's important that you invest in yourself.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:56.920]   Because if you invest in yourself and you get somebody who can see your situation dispassionately,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:04.200]   non-emotionally, and help you think creatively, you can dramatically increase the speed of
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.360]   your results.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.120]   And that matters.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.520]   Add over.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.720]   Email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.240]   Don't just dream about paradise.
