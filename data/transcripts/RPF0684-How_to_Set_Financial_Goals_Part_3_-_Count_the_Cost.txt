I would recommend to you that the first thing you should do is, um, trot out and start doing research on the car. Go to the dealership. If there's one handy to you, uh, sit in the car, look at it, uh, get the brochures and go through them and find out what it costs. Cuz then you can know what this thing is going to cost me. If I set this as a goal, you need to know that. And that experience can be useful. If you want to buy a house, there's a new house to live in of a certain quality or variety.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:43.240]  , or whether it's a rental house of some kind, then you need to go out and start looking at the houses. You can do this digitally. Look around your county and see what houses cost. See what they're going to rent for. Go out and drive around and look at some. Go to some open houses, tour some homes, etc. Knowing what something costs is a basic first step. Because then, by having those numbers in your head, you'll start to understand what's required.

[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   So money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   But there's one other resource that is the ultimate non-renewable resource,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   and that is time.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   Time is the ultimate non-renewable resource.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   And time is usually what's involved in our second area of cost, which is

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   What will you be giving up?
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   Now these opportunity costs are a little bit harder to quantify, but they are no less real simply because they're harder to quantify.

[00:23:41.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   need as much money. If you have any children as I do, and if you really prefer the idea of time in Europe and Broadway musicals and taking your children on interesting experiences, et cetera, then of course you increase your budget numbers. So, but I think somewhere in that six to $12,000 a month range is really in many ways, an ideal number, a number for many people. I've done budget analysis. Most people don't ever sit down when counting the cost and talk
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:41.360]   in a budget analysis. Most people don't ever sit down when counting the cost and talk about what they can actually spend money on. Years ago, I did a show called Why you should probably lower your financial goals. Got a lot of great feedback from that show where I went through different budgets and talked about how when you get to the higher dollar amounts, it's actually really hard to spend money. And so many people set very high financial goals without ever sitting down and thinking about what to actually spend the money on. So let's just say that your number is $8,000 a month as a plug number here. And so you multiply 8 times 20.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   That's a $8,000 a month as a plug number here. And so you multiply 8 times 20 times 20,
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:48.120]   my goal is to spend $96,000 per year. And let's round it up to a hundred thousand for easy podcast math.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.440]   So my goal is a hundred thousand dollars per year. Well,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.040]   then you sit down and you begin with the 4% rule.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.000]   Let's go with the 3% rule for safety.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.940]   So you multiply a hundred thousand times 30.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.280]   And now, you know, your number is $3 million.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.920]   Could be two and a half million, could be 3 million,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.780]   but you got to arrange an expectation of how much money you would need to save
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.860]   to accomplish that, that particular goal.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.380]   So,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   I think that's a good number.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   It's a hundred thousand dollars per year.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   Well, then you sit down and you begin with the 4% rule for safety.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   So you multiply a hundred thousand times 30 and now you know your number is 3 million.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   and now you know your number is 3 million.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   So you look at your savings rate and you calculate maybe you're saving $3,000 a month.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   So you multiply a hundred thousand times 30 and now you begin with the 4% rule for safety.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   I didn't have to depend on purely finances just to accomplish freedom,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   I didn't have to depend on purely finances just to accomplish freedom,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   but that for me, I could accomplish most of my why,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   my freedom by just simply transitioning to a different kind of business.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   That could be a lot faster way of achieving what I wanted to achieve.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   That may not be the same for you.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   If you sit down and you look at your job and you say, if I work this job for three more years,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   saving at my current rate, I'll be in a situation where I'm not going to be able to do anything.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   I'll be in a situation where I'm not going to be able to do anything.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   I'll be in a situation where I'm not going to be able to do anything.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:41.440]  ,
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   and I'm going to be able to do everything I want to do to achieve my personal financial goals.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   In which case a sensible position would be for you to work at your job.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   Now remember of course also we could play with the investment numbers.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   You sit down and you say, all right, in order for me to generate eight thousand dollars per month, I would probably need in my local area, I probably need six rental houses and if I had six rental houses paid off, then I could achieve that goal. So you start buying rental houses.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   And if I had six rental houses paid off, then I could achieve that goal. So you start buying rental houses.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   And if I had six rental houses paid off, then I could achieve that goal. So you start buying rental houses.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   I would probably need six rental houses. So you start buying rental houses. So you can do six rental houses.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   You calculate the number.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   You think about the why.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Then you think about what you give up.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   So when I went through the opportunity cost analysis, I realized that I could achieve financial freedom in a number of different ways.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   One way was by continuing in the business I was in at that time.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   It wouldn't have taken that long for financial freedom, but it still would have been a number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Significant, not insignificant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Well, when looking at it,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   it's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Well, when looking at it,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   it's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Well, when looking at it,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   it's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Well, when looking at it,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   it's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Well, when looking at it,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   it's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   It's not a significant number of years.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:41.480]   It's not a significant number of years.

We're talking about I was I was talking to her about going into a different line of business and we were brainstorming it out. This other line of business could be extremely profitable. It's something that I knew well, talking about opportunities and numbers, etc. I just said, can't give up the freedom.

[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.460]   I don't think about different how.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.460]   Different levels of how.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.800]   How can you do this?
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.640]   What are the opportunities that you have?
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.040]   How can you do this in a more efficient way?

[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.980]   Get your creative juices going.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.240]   Count the cost carefully.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.060]   Count the financial cost.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.160]   Work through different ways of looking at it.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.240]   Work through different ways of looking at it.

[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:25.260]  ,
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   Look at the budgets.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   Think about the math and count the opportunity cost.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   What will you have to give up by pursuing this goal?
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   Then we work towards the next step.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   But that will be in another show.
