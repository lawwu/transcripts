[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   and just watching what people connect with
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480]   and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.740]   math seems to come up again and again.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.160]   I'm trying to understand why that is.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.680]   Perhaps you can help give me clues.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.960]   So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320]   but it's also just other folks,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.440]   like with Numberphile, there's a channel,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.160]   where they just chat about things
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.080]   that are extremely complicated, actually.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.120]   People nevertheless connect with them.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760]   What do you think that is?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.000]   - It's wonderful, isn't it?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.680]   I mean, I wasn't really aware of it.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.200]   We're conditioned to think math is hard,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.480]   math is abstract, math is just for a few people,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.800]   but it isn't that way.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.720]   A lot of people quite like math,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   and I get messages from people saying,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.000]   "You know, now I'm retired, I'm gonna learn some more math."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.160]   I get a lot of those, it's really encouraging.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.680]   And I think what people like is that there's some order,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.680]   a lot of order, and things are not obvious, but they're true.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.200]   So it's really cheering to think
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   that so many people really wanna learn more about math, yeah.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   - And in terms of truth, again,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.680]   sorry to slide into philosophy at times,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.680]   but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120]   I mean, that's the whole point of proving things.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.680]   - It is, yeah.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000]   - And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.400]   What do you think about the nature of truth
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.840]   that math reveals?
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.720]   - Oh, wow.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   - Because it is a source of comfort, like you've mentioned.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.760]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.280]   Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.080]   I just like numbers, you know, as a kid.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.360]   This was before you had to go in
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.280]   when you had a filly in your teeth,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   you had to kind of just take it.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   So what I did was think about math,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360]   you know, like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.160]   up until the time the tooth stopped hurting
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.920]   and the dentist said you were through.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   Or counting, yeah.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.880]   So it--
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.960]   - So that was a source of just, source of peace almost.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.800]   - Yeah.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.960]   - What is it about math do you think that brings that?
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.800]   - Yeah.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.640]   - What is that?
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.680]   - Well, you know where you are.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.100]   Yeah, it's symmetry, it's certainty.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.080]   The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.480]   10 times, you get 1,024, period.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.160]   Everybody's gonna get that.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.320]   - Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.000]   - So it's both.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.680]   That's really one of the neat things.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.640]   You can be an artist and like math.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   You can be a engineer and use math.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   - Which are you?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.020]   Which--
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.860]   - Which am I?
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.080]   - What did you connect with most?
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.600]   - Yeah, I'm somewhere between.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.800]   I'm certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.680]   (laughing)
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.880]   Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.480]   because they go for an answer.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.720]   most people enjoy teaching students
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.160]   who get the abstract idea.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.840]   who are looking for a way to find answers, yeah.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
