[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.500]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, live Q&A.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.280]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.160]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680]   I'm your host.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.440]   This is Friday, March 1, 2024, Episode 999 of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.080]   On this Friday, as we do on every Friday in which I can arrange the equipment to record,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.040]   we do live Q&A.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.720]   If this is your first time here with us at Radical Personal Finance, welcome.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.880]   I'm glad that you are here.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.720]   I record these live Friday Q&A shows whenever possible, and I love doing them.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.120]   If you would like to gain access to one of these Friday Q&A shows, you can do it at patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.720]   If this is not your first time here with us, then as you know, we've been doing this quite
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   a while.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.440]   I've got 10 years, 999 episodes, but if I haven't talked to you, then remember, I would
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   love to talk to you.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880]   I always love it when new people join the Patreon, new people call in, talk about interesting
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.440]   new topics, raise questions.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.520]   Remember, your questions can be technical, they can be philosophical, you can talk about
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   anything that you want.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.480]   The mics are open, the calls are open, I don't screen them other than just trying to
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.640]   keep the numbers down with an appropriate, with a slight paid filter, so that I don't
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   have 57 callers each and every day.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.440]   But we begin today with Jeremy in Montana.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.960]   Jeremy, welcome to the show.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.640]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.920]   Yeah, I was curious if you think that having an openness to talk about money is important.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.560]   I was raised where money was like a really taboo topic, even amongst my immediate family,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.160]   and I feel that it kind of maybe stifled or hindered my development coming into adulthood.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   And the reason I ask is, I was listening to your episode with the private money, and obviously,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.920]   I don't want you to rehash that whole episode, I thought it was well done, but it just caught
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.280]   me off guard at times, because I see value in normalizing talking about finance and money
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.880]   and investing, and I think that it's an opportunity to help friends and family realize
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.920]   there can be a better solution to their lives, that if they are living in poverty, that that's
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.360]   not something they have to forever be stuck in.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.960]   And it just seemed like I was a little conflicted, because I understand the liability side, the
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   insurance side, and even like what you were talking about with pro athletes and people
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.160]   not appreciating them giving money and buying meals and stuff, but I just thought that maybe
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.840]   there's like a happy medium or something that could be established between those two.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.520]   There's definitely a tension in that podcast that you're defending, in which I defended
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.380]   the idea of being quite circumspect and private about your money.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.640]   In the latter part of that episode, I tried to work through a little bit of that tension,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.640]   saying, for example, that if you don't talk about money, you may be limiting your impact,
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.360]   you may be limiting your ability to even encourage someone in the way that you're describing.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.720]   For example, if I always lie down about my wealth, and I just don't ever, I just let
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.640]   everyone assume I'm totally broke and have no money, no assets, et cetera, then what
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   if my sharp young nephew or niece doesn't come to me and talk to me, and I could guide
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.320]   my nephews and nieces on a better path?
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.720]   How do I work through that?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.360]   How do I have the kind of impact in my community that I would like to have?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.120]   And it is a balance, and that balance will probably change in different contexts.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   It will also probably be a balance that has different levels.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.160]   So I would like people to, I think each person should make an informed decision based upon
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.640]   the potential benefits and the potential risks of anything that you say or anything that
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.520]   you do, and not forget about those goals that you're describing.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.720]   So I can think of a couple levels or a couple of filters through which we should pass this.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.120]   So the first filter would be, is the person with whom I am speaking or considering speaking
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.320]   about money, is this person trustworthy?
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   Or I have people in my life that are quite close to me with whom I would never speak
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.840]   about my finances in any way, shape, or form, because these are people who I know tend to
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.660]   speak quite openly about other people's secrets.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.760]   So if I'm engaging with somebody who brings consistently private information or personal
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   information to me, at the least, or a gossip at the worst, then I immediately put an enormous
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.900]   red flag on that person, and I say I will never reveal personal or sensitive information
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.760]   to this person, because this person is untrustworthy.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.960]   The ability of a man or woman to understand and protect people's privacy, that is a very
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   important component.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.560]   And I would draw a distinction here between secrecy and privacy.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   And what I mean here is that I don't want – for example, in my life, I don't want
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.320]   to ever do anything that would ever have to be a secret.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.740]   I don't want to keep any secrets.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.480]   I want to live a life that is without secrets.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.580]   But that's not to say that I'm not going to do things that are private.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.960]   And so in the intimacy of my relationship with my wife or my relationship with a good
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.960]   friend, you might speak about things that are private, but we would not want to speak
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.920]   about things that are secret.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.760]   And there's a balance there, because sometimes money could be simply private, sometimes money
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.800]   could be secret.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.840]   And that's another filter, is that if you're going to talk to somebody, you might share
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.880]   in some safe context with people who are circumspect, know how to control their mouth, know how
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.160]   to protect people's privacy, protect people's interests, etc.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   You might share some private details.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.800]   And there may be appropriate areas for that.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   So an example would be, as a financial advisor, I frequently know quite a lot about quite
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.360]   a lot of people's private details of their lives.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.160]   Many people tell me truthfully about their financial position.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   And I have a very privileged source of information because I talk to people about money.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.600]   So I know far more about, not everyone, but I know an enormous amount of personal private
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.940]   information of just about anybody in my life, many friends, many acquaintances, etc.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.360]   People come to me and talk to me about things.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:18.120]   But I am also extremely circumspect, I'm extremely careful, I never, ever reveal other people's
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.480]   information.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.960]   Even on the show, I occasionally will tell stories about friends or clients, but that's
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.440]   why I just never use names.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   I try to use only details that are necessary.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.840]   I speak in generalities, etc., because I have a responsibility to protect people's privacy.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.120]   Now there is an interesting line here that I've spoken about previously.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.700]   I don't have any legal ability to maintain the confidentiality of any information that
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.640]   somebody shares with me.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.520]   Years ago, I did podcasts on this, talking about why it's actually dangerous to talk
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.160]   about your finances with someone who is a financial advisor.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.200]   Let's say that a guy is getting ready to commit some kind of fraud or getting ready to commit
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.480]   some kind of some questionable shady dealing that would approach fraud.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   Maybe it's not outright fraud, but maybe it would approach fraud.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.080]   He's preparing to hide money from his wife in a divorce or hide money as he signs a prenup
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.560]   or something like that.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.580]   Well, if he talks to me as a financial advisor about his money and he shares all these details
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.960]   with me, I'll have all those details and I'll put all those details into my notes.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.040]   Those notes will be in case notes that are filed under his name.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.240]   Everything is there in the files.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.720]   If then an investigator is able to obtain a subpoena or able to subpoena me or obtain
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.120]   a warrant of some kind, then all of the information that the guy has disclosed to me or to his
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:56.080]   accountant or to his insurance agent or etc., all of that can be subpoenaed and I can be
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   obligated to testify in court.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.760]   All of my client case notes and records and that etc. can be disclosed in court.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.520]   So the only person with whom he could protect that personal information would be a lawyer,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.680]   which is why for people who have an intense need for privacy in their lives for some reason,
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.280]   I've recommended that they work with someone who's like a lawyer CPA type where they can
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.040]   actually offer that legal attorney-client confidentiality.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:31.920]   Now, obviously a lawyer can't maintain information confidentially if somebody is planning to
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.440]   commit a crime, but that still matters.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.200]   So as a person, I guess my point is that I've developed a habit of just never ever, I don't
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.240]   ever talk about people's personal details with anybody.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.080]   But that's privacy.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.080]   It's not secrecy.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.740]   There's nothing that I do, for example, in a client conversation that I would ever keep
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.240]   secret from my wife, but I never ever even tell my wife who I talk to, who I work with,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.880]   who hires me etc.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.720]   She has no clue whatsoever who among our friends and family have been clients of mine etc.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.420]   Because it's just simpler not to talk.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.200]   So if you know people who are trustworthy or you're interacting with people who are
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.800]   trustworthy who give you the expression of confidentiality, you know that if I go to
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.920]   this person and I talk about a matter of the heart, can I trust that this person, if I've
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.060]   told this person that I have feelings for this woman over here, that this family member
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.980]   at the next family gathering is not going to start ragging on me in public and betraying
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.500]   my trust, then that would be an appropriate context to then talk about more trustworthy
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.240]   things, talk about money etc.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.360]   In the context of things like family relationships, close family relationships with say parents
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.480]   and children, then I think that it's very important to talk about money and that privacy
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.240]   should not be maintained in those circumstances, as long as we're dealing with normal healthy
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.360]   relationships.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.660]   And so here there's a balance.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.720]   So for example, I do not tell my children at this point in time how much money I control.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.880]   I don't tell my children how much money I earn, because they have no need to know those
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   details.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.800]   But I do talk to them about money.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.160]   I talk to them about the principles of money, the concepts of money etc.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.320]   Why don't I talk to them about how much money I myself have and control?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.140]   Well it's because number one, there's no need to know and more importantly, I don't want
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.200]   them to gain some kind of false impression.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.120]   I don't want them to look down on people who have more money than I have or who have less
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   money than I have.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.180]   It's not necessary.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.920]   Now fast forward, let's say that I'm working with a mature son or a mature daughter.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.380]   Now I want them to have a sense of our family finances and so appropriate disclosure might
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.200]   be to talk about how much we spend.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.340]   They may not need to know all of the details of all of our investment holdings, but as
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.300]   teenagers I think it's perfectly reasonable that my teenage children should understand
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.700]   what our normal expenses are.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.000]   They need to have an expectation of what is the scale of life cost.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.140]   How much does it cost us to have a roof over our heads?
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.320]   How much does it cost us to have food on the table?
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.360]   How much does it cost us to take a two week trip to Europe?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   What is the scale of these things so that they can be prepared for what they need to
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.440]   earn and kind of what life costs?
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   Now fast forward.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.560]   Let's say that I'm 60 years old and now I have a 35 or a 40 year old son and I'm thinking
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   about retirement.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:43.960]   Well now I definitely want to recruit my son into my life to give me counsel, give me insight
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.440]   and start to look out over my finances.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.000]   And so I think that one thing that parents who are older should do is bring their children,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.560]   trustworthy children into their financial situation so that their children can help
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.400]   them and understand where they are.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.840]   It's very helpful for both parents and children to understand where we're at in terms of a
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.160]   financial position.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.640]   I've worked with many clients for example of parents who are modestly wealthy and in
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.800]   some cases the children are very wealthy.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.680]   And if the parent is modestly wealthy and is scrimping and saving to try to pass along
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.640]   money to the children, the children really want the parent to know that listen you don't
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   need to do that.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.800]   I've got plenty of money.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.160]   I want to see you enjoy and use up your money yourself.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.560]   And then things can go the other way as well is that if you have a parent who is very wealthy
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.600]   and the children are confident that the parents are very wealthy then it instills confidence
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.560]   into the children that no I don't need to set aside a large fund to take care of my
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   parents.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   They're all taken care of etc.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.240]   So I do think that communicating about money in these kinds of confidential situations
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.800]   is a wise practice, but that there's always a way that we can communicate about things
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.600]   that is appropriate.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.640]   One more layer of filtering.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.840]   There are different levels of wealth and there are different types of things that simply
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.920]   can be understood without being said.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.880]   So for example, there's the classic meme of some millionaire next door type who works
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.420]   as a janitor and he drives a $500 car or something like that.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.380]   They write stories about him at his death because he's a one-off example.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.960]   Wealthy people don't drive $500 cars, doesn't happen.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.500]   That's not a proper expression.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.560]   But you can also see based upon how someone manages his assets, the things that he purchases,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.120]   the ways that he spends etc., you can see who is wealthy.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:54.080]   It's very difficult to hide wealth and generally wealthy people don't want to hide wealth,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   but there are still benefits of not disclosing everything.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.480]   So I would say certainly it's valuable to talk about money and people should talk about
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.600]   money and talking about money among friends and family is a healthy thing.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.520]   It's probably a better subject of conversation because your friends will guide you, will
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.080]   encourage you etc., but you don't have to talk about every dollar and every dollar's
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.680]   location and everything that you have purchased just because you're talking about money.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.280]   And I would say a good metaphor that we would use would be how we talk about our most intimate
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   relationships.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.120]   I can talk with you quite a lot about my marriage relationship with my wife and I can do that
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:44.520]   in one way in public, I can do it another way in private in a confidential situation
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:50.680]   and I can do that without ever exposing any detail that could potentially be harmful to
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   my wife or to me or to our relationship and that's what I was talking about in terms of
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.320]   secrecy versus privacy.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.680]   The things that might be injurious to my wife or to our relationship if I disclosed something,
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.720]   those things aren't secrets, but they're definitely private.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   They're not things that I would be and have embarrassed to be disclosed, but they're things
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.600]   that don't need to be disclosed and shouldn't be disclosed because that keeps a confidence
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.360]   of relationship.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.880]   So you can speak broadly about money on many different levels.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.800]   You can make the points that you want to make, you can spend your money etc. while still
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   also being circumspect and not necessarily publishing your social security number on
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   a billboard.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.900]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:43.560]   I guess I've probably historically been maybe a little bit more open trying to like create
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:49.680]   disciples of five so to speak and probably would be wise to take a step back on some
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   of those things.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.840]   So I appreciate your feedback.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.720]   If you don't mind, do you have time for one more quick question?
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   Go ahead.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   Awesome.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:06.160]   So I just signed up for your camp coming up in I guess what a month and a half or so?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   Yes.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   And super excited about that.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:16.560]   Just curious if there's any ways or things that you think people need to prepare in advance
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.360]   to get the most out of it.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.800]   I know you talked about the different tracks and whatnot.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.400]   Just curious if there's questions or specific things that we should be coming and being
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.880]   prepared for or just show up and have fun.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   Absolutely.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   The camp is sold out now.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.680]   So rather than answering that in public, you will receive at the beginning of next week,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.920]   you will receive some extensive communications from me, survey, etc. and we'll communicate
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.840]   about those things among those who purchased tickets to the camp rather than my using public
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   air time here for that.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   Okay?
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   All right.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Sounds good.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   Thank you.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   Have a great weekend.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   My pleasure.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.840]   Good questions, Jeremy.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.000]   I guess the only other comment I wanted to say that I think is important enough for me
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.200]   to say is just that in general, I don't know how old you are, but in general, as I get
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   older, I increasingly learn not to tell people about my opinion about things unless they
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   ask me for it and in many ways, unless they pay me for it.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.880]   So it's hard because whenever I get enthusiastic about something, I want to be an evangelist
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   for it.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   I want to persuade others.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.760]   And so if I get super interested in, you know, financial independence, then I want to go
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.200]   and recruit others.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:41.280]   But in general, most people aren't interested and the older I get, I just try.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   It's not always appropriate.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.640]   You do want to share your opinions.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.360]   That's normal human relationships.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.840]   But in general, I'm not that interested in telling people about my ideas or the things
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.480]   that I want to persuade them of unless they've asked because I know what that feels like
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.040]   on the other side.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.660]   And so I want to drop enough hints or breadcrumbs about things that are possible to stimulate
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.560]   some ideas, but I'm not going to go on and on and on.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.720]   And so if I were going to talk about financial independence, I would say, you know, financial
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.600]   independence is very, very accessible and it can actually be done pretty quickly and
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   there's some cool ways to do it.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.600]   And then if someone's interested, I would say you can save a certain percentage of your
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.440]   income, you know, in a certain amount of time.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.840]   You can accomplish it by building a business or you can, here's what house hacking works.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   Super, super cool.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.000]   I have friends who are doing it.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.320]   Those are all ways of kind of generally bringing up topics in a really healthy way to stimulate
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.240]   and help people who might be interested in that information.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.980]   But none of that requires the disclosure of confidential personal information of here's
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.640]   how much money I have and here's how much money I'm saving and I'm going to be financially
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.160]   independent on this date.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.280]   Because those kinds of things, what good do they do?
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.120]   They're more likely to inspire jealousy, frustrations, risks to your family, risks to your wealth,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   etc.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.000]   People don't need to know any of that personal information for you to talk about ideas effectively.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Blake in Georgia.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Blake, welcome to the show.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.800]   Hey Joshua, thanks for having me.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.480]   Long time, first time.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   Welcome.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:15.920]   So my first question, I have some UTMA accounts for my kids and in a previous Q&A, I heard
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:22.000]   you say those are not the best accounts and I wanted to understand why and what is better
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.920]   and I saw what the 529s now with the new, I don't know how new it is, the Roth conversion.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.640]   Is that the way to go or am I, is there something else I don't even know about?
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.720]   The basic problem with UTMA accounts, Uniform Transfer to Minors Act or UGMA accounts, Uniform
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:46.680]   Gift to Minors Act is simply when your child becomes an adult, all of the money that you
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:55.400]   have transferred or gifted to the child immediately becomes part of, comes under the child's control.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   So you can't exercise discretion over the accounts.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.880]   When you put the money into that account, then you're saying that at 18 years old, on
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:11.760]   my child's birthday, my child is going to control this money, regardless of whether
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.560]   or not, you know, he or she is going to school, regardless of whether he or she is addicted
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.180]   to drugs, regardless of whether he or she needs this money, regardless of if it should
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:27.160]   stay invested, no, you're saying that on my child's 18th birthday, he or she legally controls
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.320]   this money.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.760]   Now the rebuttal to this is ordinarily, but that's only if he or she knows about it.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.560]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.840]   Then you don't tell him about it.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.620]   And then he turns around and sues you at 22 years old.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.200]   And now you have a legal obligation because the money is his, but you haven't told him
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.720]   about it for the last four years.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.280]   Well, I can't confirm for certain because I've not reviewed those cases.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.440]   I think, going on memory, I think that I have heard that there have been lawsuits like that.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.160]   And there's a clear legal case for your child to sue you.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.840]   So it's not that it's a bad thing.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.520]   It's simply that I would call it suboptimal, subpar.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.360]   I wouldn't cash out a UTMA account or try to make any changes.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   You can't.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   Just keep it there.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.920]   But I have not seen the circumstance in which I have recommended that account.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.040]   I should come up with a case study as to when I would recommend it, but I haven't done that
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   homework.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.480]   But I've just not seen an example in which I would recommend it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:31.120]   And I don't like the idea of you're giving up control over money for a very modest tax
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   benefit.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   Right.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.160]   You're talking about with 529s or…
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   UTMAs.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   Okay.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.680]   Well, that's why I never did a 529 because I saw a very modest tax benefit that I didn't
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   think was worth the strings being tied to it.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440]   Agreed.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   Agreed.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.040]   And I have been a very prominent promoter of that exact same thing, that for most people,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.740]   a 529 plan gives only a very modest tax benefit, and in many cases, it's probably not worth
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.960]   the surrendering of the control.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   So the same principle applies to the UTMA account.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.600]   Why not just keep the money yourself, manage it yourself?
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.160]   And if you want to give your children money, just give them money.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.760]   Why put it into an account that's segregated that has to be there?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.080]   And to ask the question is to answer it, to say, "Well, there can be circumstances in
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.640]   which this is appropriate."
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.000]   You want to actually affect that transfer.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.680]   But in most cases, you don't need a separate account for you to set aside money for your
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   child's future.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   That makes sense.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:35.320]   One more question about a previous podcast.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:41.960]   I heard you say a while ago, basically, along the lines of, "You're responsible for the
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.800]   way your children turn out or behave," and that really helped me take more responsibility
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.680]   for the things I didn't like about how my children behaved.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.880]   Do you remember, by any chance, where I could find that again?
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   No idea.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   No idea.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.280]   I have, right now, it got delayed for a few weeks.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.400]   Check back in a few weeks, and ideally, you will be able to have a searchable archive
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.920]   of all the previous podcasts as they're all transcribed, and you can search them, and
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.200]   you may be able to find that.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.860]   But I don't even know what search terms you would use to find that.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:21.080]   So I would just say you gain the benefit from the principle, and that's all you need.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's one of those things that clearly we acknowledge that, at the end of the day, our children
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.480]   are human beings, they're separate entities, they're separate persons, and they're born
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   as persons.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   There's, of course, the endless debate about nature versus nurture, etc.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.680]   All of us have seen what we perceive to be good parents who've had catastrophic results,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.540]   and all of us have seen what we perceive to be horrific parents whose children have turned
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.760]   out really well.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   So our children ultimately have agency, but at the end of the day, as parents, even if
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   it's only a metaphorical truth, as I spoke about recently in response to a term that
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.280]   a listener introduced me to, even if it's only a metaphorical truth, it's something
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   that we should live by.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.820]   And I think that every time I review the nature versus nurture stuff, I become pretty persuaded
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:17.520]   that the argument that it's all nature is pretty silly, and that the environment in
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:24.620]   which a child is raised, how his or her parents interact with a child, etc., it really does
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.360]   guide a child and set a child forward on a path.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   Awesome.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.840]   Thank you.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.560]   My pleasure.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.520]   We move on to Adam in Washington.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   Welcome, Adam.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.880]   How can I serve you today?
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:48.080]   It's a pleasure to be able to call in, and first, thank you for all the content over
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   the years.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   I mean, the introduction of different ideas, from investing in your children, money as
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.760]   a renewable resource, there's lots of really fascinating ideas, so thank you.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   My pleasure.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760]   Thank you.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.520]   So a question I have for you today is around homeschooling, and so that's one of the things
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.840]   that I never really thought much about until you started talking about it, or not started
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.960]   talking about it until I started listening to you talk about it.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.200]   And the question I have particularly is around business education, and so I'm curious if
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.440]   you found any interesting resources for teaching kids, both kind of at an industry level and
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.620]   at a function level, sales, marketing, human resources, growth, strategy, and then also,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.360]   some exposure to different industries, if you've seen that done at all in the homeschooling
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.360]   world.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.800]   I mean, I look at it, I'm having a hard time finding anything that even comes close to
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   that, and I'm wondering if you've kind of got a deeper understanding.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.160]   There are people, many people who are promoting this kind of experience, this kind of education.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.700]   I have, a couple of years ago, I signed up for, I bought somebody's information product
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.760]   called, I think, Kidpreneur, but I never dug into their program.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.560]   I just signed up for it and paid for it, and then kind of took a quick glance and meant
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.720]   to come back, and I haven't gotten around to getting back to it yet.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.000]   But they had something built around that.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:23.040]   A few years ago, I signed up for Caleb Maddox's Apex Kids thing.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.980]   I tried to use some of his things with my children, and that's his more overall personal
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.080]   development for kids kind of approach.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.520]   That didn't really take with my particular children, and so I let that go.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.360]   I have a number of books on the topic.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   I have a book called How to Turn $100 Into $1,000,000, and it's been in the library.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.920]   I haven't required the reading of it, but my 10-year-old has read it a couple of times,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.520]   enjoys it, and I think it's a good opening to it.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:02.160]   I know that there are people who are trying to build this kind of approach, and I intend
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.720]   to introduce more of these ideas as I get into the teenage world.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.480]   So I have a plan in terms of my own curriculum that I am building for my children.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:25.120]   I have a plan to introduce more of these contexts at a later time.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:32.360]   So there is a course that is on my plan from the Ron Paul Curriculum, where they teach
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.360]   Business 1 and Business 2 as part of the Ron Paul Curriculum, kind of a homeschooling curriculum.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:44.820]   The author of that course in the Ron Paul Curriculum – I can't remember his name
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.800]   off the top of my head, forgive me – but he also has a website that he is building
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.720]   teaching business skills to teens, taking them through the process.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.040]   That's another resource that is on my planned list that I haven't reviewed personally
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.320]   yet.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:08.220]   But on the whole, I am skeptical of the idea of "teaching business" for two reasons.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:16.360]   Number one, I am skeptical of making the concept of education practical.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.600]   What I mean is, I have complained, just like a lot of other people have complained, "Well,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.820]   why do we have to learn all this stuff that we never use in life?
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.820]   Why are we taking algebra?
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.220]   You never do algebra in real life.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   Why are we taking chemistry?
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.360]   We never do chemistry in real life.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.700]   Why don't they teach normal, useful stuff in school?
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.440]   Why don't they teach you how to do your taxes in school?"
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.360]   That's a very common refrain.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.000]   If you go to any social media thread and you post something or find something about what
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.080]   should children study in school, you'll find that a lot of people feel this way about
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   their education.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.600]   "Why wasn't it more practical?"
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.360]   I have the opposite regret.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.080]   I pursued a very practical education, I got a degree in business, and I now look back
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.440]   and I just think, "That was a waste of four years.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.840]   Why did I waste four years of my life studying business when I could have studied something
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.280]   actually interesting?
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.640]   If I could have studied philosophy or humanities or history or something that would actually
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.720]   be interesting to me?"
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.040]   And I know how silly that sounds, but the reason is that I think we need to get past
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:27.080]   the idea of education being a functional commodity, and we should embrace education as an opportunity
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   for truly creating free human beings.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.240]   I'm a proponent of a liberal education, and the goal of a liberal education is to liberate
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   people.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:46.800]   And I would consider it a very sad person who has gone through years of schooling and
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.960]   has only come out the other side with the ability to do business.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.640]   Now, you're not saying this, I'm just kind of trying to set out a basic framework.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.560]   That business is one component of life, and it's an important component, but it is not
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.960]   the purpose of an education.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:09.160]   And I reject pretty strongly now that the idea of school subjects or the curriculum
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.280]   that we choose should be primarily practical in nature.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:19.880]   I think that our goal with education is to spread a delectable buffet, a delectable feast
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:26.160]   in front of our children from an enormous diverse array of options, and then allow them
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:33.400]   to choose among those options and be exposed to this broad general experience of life so
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.200]   that they can create and chart their own path.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.120]   The second objection that I have is to think that somehow business is something that is
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.720]   difficult to learn or difficult to teach.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.560]   I don't think that you would need much more than, you know, six months or a year of a
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.760]   business curriculum to know just about everything you need to know to get started.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.960]   It's very different, learning the skills of business is very different than, say, learning
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.600]   to be a skillful writer or learning to be skilled at mathematics.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:14.280]   There's just an enormous learning curve with writing and mathematics that doesn't exist
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.680]   in business.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.160]   And academic knowledge related to business is not an effective way of building business
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.960]   skills beyond the basic fundamentals.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.880]   And so I think that a better way to approach the concept of business education rather than
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:38.520]   from a general perspective should be to give specific skills that could be leveraged into
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.240]   a specific job or a specific career.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.360]   So here are a couple of examples from my list.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.840]   One of the things, one of the opportunities that I think is – well, the basic skill
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.280]   of business is the skill of sales.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.320]   So anytime we can find something related to sales, then I want to encourage that.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.480]   But sales skills are hard to teach academically and they're better taught when there's an
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.600]   opportunity to sell.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.200]   And so that's something that I look – I want to look for opportunities to teach for
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   a young person to sell and encourage them to sell so that they can start to acquire
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   those skills.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.160]   But I'm not going to start going through five books on selling if there's no context for
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   it.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.340]   However, there are skills that I think could relate to things like selling but also relate
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.060]   to a specific career.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:39.000]   So when my students are in their teenage years, I intend to require an enormous amount of
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.360]   writing from them.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   Writing and speaking.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:48.540]   I believe that the most important literacies for students to be really skilled at are the
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:55.800]   active literacies of public speaking or speaking in general both in a private context and in
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.520]   a public context and also in writing.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.720]   The ability to write is fundamental.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.520]   And so I would – I plan to introduce things like let's do a copywriting course and let's
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.200]   practice copywriting.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.560]   It's a very useful form of writing.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:17.240]   It is writing so it's perfectly functional in terms of a component of an English curriculum
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:24.360]   yet it is something where you can genuinely build a phenomenal career as an independent
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   copywriter.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.600]   It's a career that a child can do from any corner of the world and make tens of thousands
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.660]   of dollars per year, nay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, even as a teenager.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:41.840]   And it's also something that is enormously useful in one's own personal business if someone
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.720]   has his own personal business.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.400]   And so that to me is one of those really foundational things and I'm much more excited about a
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.500]   child going through a copywriting course than I am about some general business education.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.700]   The second example I would use is something like accounting or bookkeeping.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.740]   Although this market is changing right now and I don't know where we'll be three or
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:17.540]   four years from now, but it is very doable for a teenager to not only learn about bookkeeping
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:24.540]   and accounting but also to become credentialed and certified either as a bookkeeper or as
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:33.140]   an accountant and build an independent business in the teenage years that allows a teen to
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.420]   earn adult wages but in a teenage context.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.660]   And yet that's a fundamental business skill.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.180]   You are understanding, starting to understand financial statements, understanding the basic
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:49.300]   functioning of taxes, again financial statements are the most important thing, but that can
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.380]   be leveraged both to create income now but then also as a general component of business
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.660]   education.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.140]   So I'm pretty excited about this idea of saying what are some basic skills and let's learn
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.340]   the business skills but in the context of the meta skills, the meta skills that can
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.500]   be applied in various businesses.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:11.620]   And I think with an encouraging environment, say yeah, try that, go ahead and do that,
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.060]   and don't force a child to stick with something for a very long time but encourage them to
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.500]   try something, I think that's a good way of gaining expertise.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.440]   And then finally, I have the personal MBA reading list, both the actual book written
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.700]   by Josh Kaufman as well as the reading list, I have that scheduled as part of kind of overall
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.060]   exposure to business concepts.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:39.860]   While I acknowledge that reading 100 books on business is pretty large, but I think that
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.340]   in general if someone reads 10 or 15 or 20 books on business, especially if they're books
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:51.660]   that are being studied in specific application to a business, then I think that's an abundantly
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.780]   useful business education.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:58.900]   So those are my ideas, probably less well stated than I would like, but those are my
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:04.280]   ideas on a business education, that it's important but I don't think it's more important than
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.660]   academic subjects.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.700]   I think that business is one of the easier things to learn and that it should be a modest
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.420]   component of, certainly a very modest component of the younger years.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.840]   And then as we move to the teenage years, it should be a component but not an overwhelming
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:26.200]   component because the major goal of education is not strictly practical but rather it is
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.260]   an important component and what we want to do is help our children and fit them for a
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.260]   couple of careers.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.620]   In conclusion, one of the reasons I'm very passionate about homeschooling is I think
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.060]   that it's the best context for both of these things together.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:48.940]   So my basic mental model for a really good teenage homeschool curriculum is that an academic
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:56.980]   curriculum is imposed upon the student during his or her teenage years to the tune of about
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.140]   three to four hours a day of work.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.980]   So ideally, student starts at eight and is done at noon.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:07.380]   And I think with three to four hours of focused work a day, you can produce top-tier academics
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.980]   in a homeschooling context because of the efficiency of time use as well as the efficiency
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.460]   of education because you don't have to be held back by classroom movements but the student
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:22.140]   can always be right at his frontier of learning where learning is efficient.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:27.420]   Then the student should be encouraged from noon to night and also we can eliminate homework,
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.420]   we can eliminate all the rest of the stuff, the student should be encouraged from noon
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:39.540]   to night to develop his or her own businesses, his or her own expressions of business and
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:45.220]   those things can be learned in the context of a job, a business, a skill that's being
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.780]   developed and that that's the best way to learn those skills.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:54.500]   And then I see myself not as providing a formal academic curriculum to teach you the skills
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:00.700]   of business but rather mentoring and coaching through the real experiences of being in business.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.500]   eBay Motors is here for the ride.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.020]   With over 122 million parts for your number one ride or die, you can make sure your ride
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.500]   stays running smoothly, brake kits, LED headlights, bumpers, whatever your baby needs, eBay Motors
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   has it.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.700]   And with eBay Guaranteed Fit, it's guaranteed to fit your ride the first time, every time.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.620]   Plus, at these prices, you're burning rubber, not cash.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.740]   Keep your ride or die alive at ebaymotors.com, eligible items only, exclusions apply.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.620]   Yeah, yeah, that makes sense and I guess the lens I was thinking about through more was
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.740]   the world of stories, one of the things that you mentioned a few months ago, I think, was
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:46.060]   reading your kids the biography of Marie Curie as a way to introduce them to this whole world
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:52.660]   of books as the ultimate instructor or the best tutor in the world.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:57.220]   And I guess one of the ideas that you put out there even earlier than that was around
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.700]   spending money to learn things related to your industry and give yourself a personal
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   education budget.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:07.420]   So I've been spending a whole bunch of money on Harvard Business School case studies related
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.460]   to the industry that I work in and I found that it's been some of the best money I've
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:16.660]   ever spent going through these different stories and seeing it through that lens.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.020]   So I appreciate your answer.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.860]   For someone who has a high interest in business, we want to encourage that.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:30.500]   I don't want to be recently trying to keep these comments short.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.740]   We want to encourage business but I'm nervous about an exclusive focus on business.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:43.580]   I would not want to graduate an 18-year-old who is only skilled with business but is not
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:49.140]   well informed about other important components of what it means to be highly educated.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.620]   I also don't want to graduate an 18-year-old who exclusively has academic knowledge and
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:41:00.940]   academic skills and doesn't have any experience applying learning to the world and doesn't
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:06.080]   have any context of business, doesn't have any sense of how to make money in the world.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.300]   So I want to shoot right up the middle.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.260]   I don't want to sacrifice either of those things and I definitely do want to encourage
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.420]   business knowledge and I think that your expression of Harvard Business Review case studies is
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.420]   really great.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.380]   There's a whole lot of other skills that need to be applied.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:31.460]   So things like gaining access to people.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.980]   I think one of the high school projects that we want to teach high schoolers is we want
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.860]   to make sure that they are systematically building the skills of gaining access to important
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.220]   people and we want to figure out a reason for them to gain access to important people
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.220]   which is probably going to involve some kind of sales skills, some kind of advocacy for
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.980]   something, etc.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:42:00.640]   And so all of these I see are related to business and that they will serve a child well who
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.300]   then wants to pursue business in an entrepreneurial way.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.980]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.860]   And two other kind of quicker ones if that's okay.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.300]   You mentioned investing in your children's bodies.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.660]   I thought that whole series was great by the way.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.460]   Just on balance and something I've got three kids under five years old and my five-year-old
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.580]   and three-year-old are really interested in gymnastics which is like quickly becoming
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.780]   a huge time investment like as they get better and better at it, they get invited to spend
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.260]   more and more time doing it.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.220]   I'm wondering if your kids have expressed an interest in that or if you've dabbled with
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220]   that at all.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:43.700]   Kind of in the spirit of that, investing in balance and finding a way to invest in your
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.340]   kids' bodies from a strength standpoint.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:51.180]   And the other one just to put it out there, you can answer them together and I'll be done.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.780]   You had mentioned at some point that you were self-recording English-Spanish translations
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.300]   and you were considering releasing it.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.420]   I was wondering if you had an update on that and it'd be something I would love to listen
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.060]   to as I dabble in that world of learning another language.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.060]   Thank you.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:12.180]   To the subject of the books, it's an ambition of mine and my ambitions are far beyond my
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.380]   capacity to deliver them in a timely manner.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.820]   And it's an enormous point of frustration that I myself am fixing because these things
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.900]   need to exist.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:26.020]   I just am working on expanding my team to make it happen and I find the same limits
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.020]   that we all do.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.180]   But it's a new day, working better and making progress on that.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:36.260]   With regard to the physical stuff, I was just quite literally before recording this podcast,
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.540]   I was just talking with my wife about this and I'll just share specifically what we're
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   talking about.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.340]   I'm almost finished with this book called Range by David Epstein and I've been reading
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.100]   this book as a rebuttal to some of my other readings.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.140]   I read a book called Peak by Anders Ericsson and a book called Talent is Overrated by Jeff
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.500]   Colvin.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.140]   Both excellent books, but especially Talent is Overrated, Colvin, I think, would advocate,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:07.700]   he does advocate for a highly specialized form of training that if we want to produce,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.860]   say, you know, someone's interested in gymnastics, then if we want our child to be a world-class
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.660]   gymnast, then we should sign up for the gymnastic gym, we should be there four hours a day with
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:23.260]   kind of what I think we would think if I say a Soviet-style gymnastics training program,
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.940]   I think that would resonate, you know, with what the Soviets often did.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:30.340]   They would find a student who, a young child who displayed some basic promise, they would
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:36.580]   take the child away from his or her parents, put him under a coach and all the child's
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:41.980]   life would be gymnastics or boxing or hockey or whatever it happened to be, and to this
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.340]   very intense level of development.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:51.500]   So David Epstein's book, Range, is very much a rebuttal to that, basically saying that
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.740]   it's not the only way that people learn is to just do one thing all the time and only
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.420]   do that well.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.500]   And I'm pretty nervous about what I think could be called the tiger mom, you know, idea
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.340]   that you have a mom who comes along and says, "My child is going to be great at this," and
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.580]   push, push, push, push, push.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.260]   I don't see that as appropriate parenting.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:16.740]   I see that as more harmful than helpful, even though it may result in somebody developing
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.500]   genius-level skills in an environment.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.140]   And the conversation that I had with my wife just today was a good approach to this is
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.620]   seasonality.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.260]   And I think that's one thing that is often missing.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.740]   I assume it's still this way.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.220]   When I was in high school, we had sports.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.880]   We had basically fall sports and spring sports, and I think this is still the case.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.180]   So you have your football season, you have your basketball season.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.340]   You have your baseball season, you have your swimming season.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.460]   And an athlete could do multiple sports.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.420]   And I think there's abundant evidence to say that that's probably a good thing and not
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:57.500]   a bad thing, because right now where you see this is parents, you know, they push their
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.540]   child into Little League, and then they push their child on their travel team.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.740]   And it's like you've got a dad or a mom who's just trying to fulfill his own dreams with
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   his child.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.260]   And yes, the child may be good at baseball, and ultimately is burned out by 18 and never
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.540]   wants to see a baseball again.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:14.260]   I don't see that as a proper frame.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.900]   So I think seasonality is an answer, is to say, "Hey, we're really into gymnastics.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:19.900]   Great.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:20.900]   Let's do it.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   Let's do it for three months.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.980]   And let's be really into gymnastics for three months, and then let's quit it.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.220]   And let's go do rock climbing, and rock climbing is going to be our thing for three months.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.900]   And then after that, it's going to be baseball.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:32.900]   Let's do baseball."
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:37.860]   And we want to expose our children to a diverse level of things, and then listen to them.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.180]   And if they really, really, really want to go back to gymnastics, great, let's go back
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.580]   to gymnastics.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.380]   But we can guide appropriately.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.620]   We want to think about those basic skills.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.500]   Every sport's going to have a different set of skills.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.340]   Every sport's going to cultivate something unique.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.740]   But not let it take over your life to where you're spending hours and hours every week
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.740]   doing it.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.020]   You can do that for three months.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.740]   So call it a season and say, "For this season, we're going to do gymnastics."
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.980]   Then what would you guys like to do next?
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.980]   And let's take a break.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.260]   Let's have an off-season.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.860]   And then let's think about what we're going to do in the fall or the spring.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.980]   I think that's a good way of approaching it.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   Awesome.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   Thank you.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.980]   My pleasure.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   All right.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.380]   An enormous number of callers, so we'll go a little faster.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.380]   Preston in Arizona.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.380]   Welcome to the show.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.380]   How can I serve you today?
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.380]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.980]   Appreciate you taking the time to talk to us today.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:32.420]   My question is based on, generally, what's an appropriate amount to invest in a single
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:38.180]   investment, more specifically, in your own company stock?
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:46.180]   So for some context, have about $300,000 worth of company stock.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.460]   You're dropping out on me.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.140]   $300,000 a company stock.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   Go ahead.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.140]   Okay.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:00.340]   Maybe a little bit more, $70,000, the best over the next few years.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.020]   There's an opportunity to buy more today.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.540]   I have the expectation that the stock is going to perform very, very well over the next few
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.540]   years.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:15.100]   I just want to keep in mind maybe some ideas that you have on what's an appropriate amount
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:20.060]   of allocation for one investment, particularly company stock.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:25.980]   This is a hard question because I could present a few different models that I have learned
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:30.940]   and heard, but at the end of the day, I think it's going to be a gut call by you.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:37.540]   Because if your company stock performs well, and you know, you feel like, and you believe
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.420]   that it's going to perform well, then you're going to want to be invested in it heavily.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.540]   So in hindsight, let's look back.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.860]   Imagine that you are an early engineer at Facebook, or an early engineer at Tesla, and
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.340]   you're being paid in company stock.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.820]   And imagine you're talking to your financial advisor, and your financial advisor is saying
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.900]   to you, "Well, you really should be prudent.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.060]   And after all, we have an enormous amount of isolated risk between your employment and
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060]   your company.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.460]   And after all, you should know about the company stock.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.860]   So why don't you go ahead and put it all into an index fund?"
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.740]   Well, fast forward 10 years.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.540]   You're not very happy with that advice, are you?
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.540]   No.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   Okay.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.540]   So now we can say the flip side.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.060]   Let's say that you have all your company in stock, and I don't know what bankruptcy to
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.060]   refer to.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.540]   It seems kind of dumb to talk about WorldCom or Enron at the moment, but those were kind
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.740]   of classic examples that you're an early employee, etc.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.140]   Well, now you would appreciate that diversification.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:40.060]   So at the end of the day, every man is going to have a different gut feeling, a different
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:45.460]   decision and be willing to take a different amount of risk on his beliefs.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.900]   And then you're going to have to consider your phase of life and to say, "Can I afford
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.540]   to take this risk?"
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:56.460]   So let's just – I can't give you a perfect answer because knowledgeable, smart people
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.920]   would give you a variety of models.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.260]   So I'm going to give you some filters to pass it through instead because I think that's
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.260]   the most useful.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.900]   Number one, think about – on a recent Q&A, I went through kind of an elaborate discussion
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.500]   around Bitcoin.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:15.060]   Go back and listen to the most recent Friday Q&A where a listener called and said, "Should
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.140]   I sell my real estate and move to Bitcoin?"
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:21.360]   And I gave an elaborate discussion of how you would decide whether to do that and how
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.660]   to do that and whatnot.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.420]   I think a lot of that applies to your situation.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.720]   So since that's already there, let me go to a few more things.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.980]   Number one, think about your stage in life.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:40.180]   There's a big difference between being very young and wanting and really needing to make
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:47.300]   big wins versus being very old and not needing to make big wins but wanting to avoid big
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.580]   losses.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:55.340]   And so it makes all the sense in the world to me for a younger man who is at a company
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.300]   that's giving him company stock and he believes in the company, it makes all the sense in
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:04.860]   the world to me for him to keep it in company stock even though there's an intense concentration
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:11.780]   of risk because it may turn out to be a great long-term move for him if he believes in the
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.380]   company as you do with yours, that I think it's going to perform well.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:21.420]   On the other hand, there's a great deal of risk to the guy who is older in his career
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:27.940]   to have an extreme concentration in his company stock especially that if he loses his job
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.580]   and he loses his stock value at the same time, then it's a double whammy.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.700]   So you want to think about the phase of life.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.220]   You want to think about the alternative use of the dollar.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.580]   So if you sell the stock, what are you going to do with the money?
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.300]   And then go through that way of thinking that I described in the Bitcoin course, okay, if
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.060]   I sell the stock, am I going to put it in the index fund?
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:50.460]   Well, now I know I'm not going to get much wins but at least I'm not going to get much
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.700]   losses ideally as compared to the current scenario.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.700]   And then just simply go with the scenario that feels best for you.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:05.620]   And while you're doing that, make a plan to say here's how I would know if things are
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   going to change.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:13.020]   So here's how I would know if I'm going to go ahead and sell my company stock.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.900]   I would get married and want to buy a house.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.580]   Well, this would be the money that I would use to buy a house and if I could pay cash
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:21.580]   for a house, that would be fantastic because imagine starting your life as a young man
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.340]   with a debt-free house, that would be well worth it.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.020]   That would be a smart move.
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.700]   Or if I didn't start feeling confident in the company, I'm going to start selling stock
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.060]   but that's also my sign that I'm going to look for a job.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:42.020]   I think this kind of subjective discussion, even though it's not specific, is the best
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:46.780]   way that you're going to come to arriving at what you personally think and believe.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:52.580]   And I think it's a better answer than only put 10% of your net wealth in any one thing,
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.580]   etc.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.900]   You need to ask yourself, where am I in my wealth building journey?
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.160]   Am I looking for a big win?
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.780]   Is this company a big win?
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.900]   Is there a better use of the dollar?
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.500]   And not just play the conservative angle if you don't need to play the conservative angle.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.580]   But if you do need to be conservative, then go ahead and start being conservative.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   Okay.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.580]   That's helpful.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.140]   I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.140]   Thank you.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:26.620]   I don't have a mathematical model to offer to you, but I do have my own personal regret
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:30.700]   of not being more aggressive.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:38.540]   And there are some who have regrets from being aggressive.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:43.340]   And so you yourself, for example, you might have your salary and then your company stock
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.100]   that you receive as part of your compensation package.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.900]   You might not take your entire salary and go and buy more company stock.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.180]   But so you might choose your diversification that way.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.740]   But in general, if you believe in the future of the company and you have no other information
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.680]   that would say that you're wrong, I think you're going to want to bet on yourself and
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:10.300]   bet on the company and have the confidence that comes with trusting yourself versus trying
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:16.380]   to take some external person's framework to say, "Well, we never own individual stocks.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.860]   It's too much concentration of risk," et cetera.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:23.020]   I think you'll feel better betting on yourself than the other way.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.620]   Andrew in Mexico City.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620]   Welcome, Andrew.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   How can I serve you today?
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   Hi.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   Good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.380]   Thank you for your time today.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.860]   I had a question on behalf of my wife and I.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:39.820]   We recently created a revocable living trust in order to have a say in how our life's work
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.460]   would be drawn down.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:47.260]   In the event of our early passing, a percentage would remain with our family, pay for education,
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.260]   healthcare expenses.
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.320]   We have that pretty nailed down.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.500]   Our primary plan, assuming that we live long and healthy lives, is to eventually donate
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:59.340]   a majority of it to charity, charitable causes during our lifetimes.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.140]   We're in our mid-30s right now.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.260]   We have time to identify those organizations closer to our 60s and 70s.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.100]   What I'm having trouble with is how to identify high-quality organizations that make a significant
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.260]   difference in the communities in which they operate and have a high likelihood of continuing
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.180]   to do so in the future.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:21.740]   We need to get these written down in case of our early passing and we don't get the
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:25.960]   chance to spend or donate the money before or during our retirement years.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.060]   How would you go about identifying these organizations in a way that doesn't involve Google searches
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.060]   just until the end of time?
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:36.420]   I guess I'm just looking for an effective way of going about this since there are so
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   many options.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:43.500]   And the pressure at the moment is that you need to state in your new trust documents,
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.940]   you need to state specific organizations, is that right?
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.940]   Correct.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.660]   That page is currently blank.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.700]   We created this trust about a year ago and we've had many discussions.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.260]   It just kind of feels like we're stalled out at the moment and just need to see a fresh
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.020]   way of how to name these particular organizations, yes.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:08.580]   Do you have any personal experience with volunteering for an organization, your mother working for
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.580]   an organization, etc.?
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.620]   Is there just an organization that you've been around?
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:19.520]   Yes, we're both on the board of directors for a small non-profit based in Minnesota
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.580]   that is involved in high school education.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:29.220]   So we do have experience with operating non-profits, how they operate, actually operating them,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.820]   finding effective ways of spending money on tight budgets, etc.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:40.120]   How would you feel if you just simply chose the organization that you currently are involved
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.300]   in, just to fill it in for now, recognizing that you have time to come back in the future?
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.940]   Would that solve your problem?
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.380]   That is at the top of our list.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:55.380]   I think the budget of that organization is probably smaller than what we'd be leaving
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.380]   behind.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.420]   So we're trying to find some other organizations as well.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:06.860]   And this particular organization does have a bit of a cap in the impact that we can make
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.100]   in terms of quantity of students.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.300]   We've reached that.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:18.180]   So I think that anything over and above, there wouldn't be as good of a use of the funds.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:29.640]   You are hitting on a subject, a question that is one of my most pressing interests and passions.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.820]   I am pretty obsessed at the moment with this exact question that you're talking about.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:42.420]   How do we identify effective ways of causing change in the world so that we can support
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   them?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:49.340]   This is an enormous passion of mine, and it's something that I desire very strongly in the
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:54.820]   coming months and years to try to figure out.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:59.620]   About all I know right now is I'm pretty dissatisfied with virtually all of the advice that I hear
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:02.820]   anybody giving, and I'm dissatisfied with the advice that I myself can give.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.740]   I don't know the answers to it.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:09.140]   So let me just tell you a few of the models to talk about.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:14.700]   So a good starting point, there are a number of publications that rate charities.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:18.260]   Charity Navigator I think is probably the most prominent one.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.540]   So I would begin there.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:25.740]   Charity Navigator is an organization that is focused on identifying the basic functioning
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:33.460]   of various not-for-profit organizations and identifying their metrics, what's their income,
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.700]   what's the compensation of their employees, their boards, et cetera, what percentage of
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:44.480]   their efforts go to project work versus administration, et cetera.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:51.660]   And I have no reason to think that they do a bad job or are in any way untrustworthy.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.820]   And so I would encourage you to start there.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:59:02.200]   And I would basically say to you, just pick a couple of topics or interests that are from
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.860]   an organization like Charity Navigator for now just to fill it in, because that's where
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.860]   you start.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:17.460]   Now, my questions are bigger because I question a lot of the basic fundamental assumptions
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.460]   that people have.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.820]   And I'll give one example that is like the Pilata example.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:27.640]   I forget the guy's first name, but years ago when I was doing my – I have a designation
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:33.120]   called a Chartered Advisor in Philanthropy, C-A-P designation.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.380]   And it was a series of classes and courses that I went through.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:41.120]   It was one of my more interesting ones that I did because we did it – I was a financial
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:45.820]   advisor and we had basically a cohort of like 20 people.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.480]   And there were about three or four of us from financial services.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.120]   There were about three or four lawyers in the cohort.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:56.640]   There were about three or four executive directors of not-for-profit organizations.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.540]   There were – I forget the other things, but basically this interesting cohort of interdisciplinary
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.320]   people and we all did the classes together.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.560]   And we read an essay by a guy named Pilata, I think Dan Pilata or something like that.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.120]   And it was quite controversial at the time.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.160]   This is more than a decade ago, but – or not – yeah, more than a decade ago.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:22.400]   It was very popular because Pilata was making the case that one of the worst metrics to
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.160]   look at is the metric that most people start with, which is what percentage of an organization's
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:34.800]   budget goes to organization overhead versus actual impact.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.360]   And Pilata's argument was that while people say, "Oh, a well-run charity is one that
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.920]   has a very thin overhead and puts most of its money into project work, et cetera,"
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.420]   that that's nonsense.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.060]   That the best run – a well-run charity is one that makes the biggest impact on the desired
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.300]   focus, on the desired area, rather than overhead.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300]   What's better?
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.780]   To have an organization, for example, that has a 10% overhead budget and contributes
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:08.860]   90% to the project but has a total budget of say $100 million so that $90 million is
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:17.300]   going to the project work or an organization that has a 30% overhead but 70% goes to project
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   work but has a budget amount of say $1 billion.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:28.980]   Well, obviously, $700 million is a much bigger impact than say $90 million to the actual
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.980]   cause.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:36.100]   And so if you had to increase the overhead of the organization from 10% to 30% but at
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:43.740]   the end of the day, you could increase the impact from $90 million to $700 million, then
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.380]   wouldn't that be a much better move?
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.180]   And the point has stuck with me since then.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   Now it's been debated.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.940]   There were a lot of people that disagreed with that.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.300]   But this is an example that has always stood by me because prior to coming into that essay,
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:01.340]   I would have firmly sided on that, "Well, the mark of a good organization is one that
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:08.620]   spends the least amount on overhead and the mark of a bad organization is one that has
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:12.580]   a high overhead ratio where a lot of people working for it are making too much money,"
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   things like that.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.100]   I now don't believe that.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.580]   So we want to look for impact.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:22.420]   The problem is how do you judge impact if you're not intimately familiar with the industry?
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:31.900]   And I don't think you can be intimately familiar by perusing any marketing brochures or even
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:37.740]   charity navigator to – how can you get that level of familiarity?
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.900]   You have to go to something where you actually know, something that you're actually going
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.060]   to be involved in.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.460]   So on the whole, the long-term answer that I would love to give to you is to say you
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:55.940]   and your wife choose an issue or a couple of issues that are really important to you
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:03.020]   and then dedicate a significant portion of your time and your resources towards investigating
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.740]   those particular issues.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.380]   And so you say, "We really want to make a change in education."
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.340]   I think you mentioned the organization you're involved with is involved in education.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.340]   Okay.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   Well, what's the change?
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.540]   You want to really be as knowledgeable in that space as possible.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.900]   And in the process of becoming knowledgeable about that space, then you'll be aware of
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:29.380]   the organizations that need your help, the organizations that are doing things, and you'll
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.140]   be aware of the impact of those organizations.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.820]   And those things are all impossible to find from a public perspective, but they're pretty
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.860]   easy to find when you start building relationships and contacts in that industry.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.580]   I find this in any new industry is that from the outsider's perspective, all I have is
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.580]   marketing literature.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:52.220]   But once I start meeting some people and the microphones are off and the cameras are off
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:55.740]   and they'll just quietly say, "Well, this company over here, they don't do anything
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.380]   and these guys are the scammers."
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.140]   And I can't say that publicly, but these guys are the scammers and these guys are the good
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.140]   guys.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.620]   And the same thing I think is happening in charitable organizations.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.380]   And then the other comment I would make is you need to question the entire premise of
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.860]   is a not-for-profit organization actually the way that you're going to accomplish your
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.340]   goals.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:43.820]   That's something that I think is too often accepted as a given.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:05:01.580]   It's too often accepted as a given that a not-for-profit is a superior option, but
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.160]   is not something that should be accepted.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.900]   And so you may want to, in the fullness of time, as you get closer to the actual disbursements,
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.100]   you may want to regularly revisit this.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.940]   And sometimes you may want to put individuals on there, you may want to put companies that
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.780]   are even for-profit companies, and then include also not-for-profits in it.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:24.560]   So short answer, charity navigator, longer answer, choose one area of interest or two
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.980]   areas of interest and make that the research project that you and your wife are involved
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   in.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.560]   And if you have one area of interest and you go to four or five galas for the organization
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.260]   or some fundraisers, donate a small amount of money, get on the mailing lists, get involved,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.260]   etc.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:47.320]   Then over the next three, five, ten years, as you pay attention, you'll get a much better
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.760]   sense of who's actually doing well, who's making an impact in the fields that you care
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   about.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   Wonderful.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Thank you.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   My pleasure.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   We move on to Sheldahl in Minnesota.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   Welcome, Sheldahl.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:16.540]   Say, I want to get your thoughts on a framework on valuing a business, attempting to help
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.880]   a couple of brothers.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.720]   They own a bar in a small town in middle America.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:28.840]   They inherited it from their parents and so everything's free of any debt.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.800]   It includes the land, building, and the business.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.160]   The older brother spends five to ten hours a week doing some bookkeeping, inventory,
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.880]   that kind of stuff, and he takes a small salary for that.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:47.280]   Other than that, they're basically receiving, since they own the land and the building,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.440]   they're basically renting those facilities to the business and paying themselves rent
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   checks.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:00.000]   So that, along with distributions, they're getting about $80,000 a year in profit or
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.840]   cash flow from the business.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.720]   Basically one wants to buy the other out and have his son kind of run the business.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:22.120]   The younger brother's not necessarily ready to sell, but feeling like just to keep things
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.200]   cordial in the family or whatever, they're considering it.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.080]   The hard part is, since the younger brother doesn't necessarily want to sell, he likes
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:36.640]   getting his $40,000 a year in income, the two of them still have to come to a price
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.680]   for the business to buy the other person out.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.560]   So I'm wondering what you have for kind of setting up a framework, what you think we
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.600]   should be looking at, what kind of questions we should ask as we work through this.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.960]   Are you in the middle, kind of representing both of them or do you have one party on your
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:00.280]   … You're representing just one party in this negotiation?
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.880]   I'm basically friends with both, so I'm just trying to help bring conversation among them
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.480]   and try to keep things friendly as we talk through it.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:17.000]   We've talked about bringing in their accountant that's worked with them for a number of years
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.800]   with the business to kind of go through some annual reports and put together some histories
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.120]   and stuff like that.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.800]   I'm not legally representing either of them at this point.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.800]   Okay.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:37.760]   Well, I think there are at least three different valuations that could be applied to just about
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:44.160]   any business, and I think probably more, but let's start with three.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.500]   The first valuation is the easiest.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.260]   It's going to be some form of industry standard.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:56.080]   Every different industry is going to have some kind of generally accepted industry standard.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.640]   There's somebody who is a broker of bars in your region that you can reach out to and
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.720]   contact, and that would be the first person I would look for, is find a business broker,
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:14.760]   find a business website, find a broker who has worked with these kinds of businesses,
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:21.380]   and then just get some insight, what do these things sell for, and figure out how it's calculated,
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:27.120]   what the pre-multiple numbers are, what the multiple is, et cetera.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:34.200]   Work through that list, and you'll get some sense of the industry valuation.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.400]   The problem is that that's not really the most impactful thing.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.160]   The second form of valuation is, well, what would I need to do to replace this?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:52.320]   If I'm a part-time owner of a business like this, and I'm making $40,000 a year with a
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.000]   very modest amount of work, maybe even no work, or just a few hours here and there to
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.360]   make sure things are being run honestly, that's a pretty significant thing to replace.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.560]   $40,000 of income is quite a lot.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.120]   Let's use the 4% rule as an example.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   If I needed to replace that $40,000 a year with mutual funds, and I'm using the 4% rule
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.360]   of drawing money on mutual funds, I need about a million dollars in mutual funds.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.120]   That's a lot.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.680]   I would be pretty surprised if a brother was ready to, if one is ready to offer the other
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.200]   a million dollars on this kind of business.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.400]   And yet, if this guy wants to replace this $40,000 that he's getting, he kind of needs
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   a million dollars.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.960]   You see the logic?
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.180]   Yep, that's what I kind of think about the different options or different ways of looking
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.180]   at it.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.560]   Like, okay, there's challenges.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560]   Right.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.120]   And so he's got a pretty good deal.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.440]   Now we could argue left, right, and center that, well, obviously you're a lot safer with
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.760]   a million dollars in mutual funds than you are with one little bar in the middle of nowhere.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.600]   But at the end of the day, I'm not thinking about that.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.960]   I'm thinking about the fact that, hey, I've done this business for a while.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.240]   People's drinking habits are unlikely to change very frequently, especially in the Midwest.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.700]   There's not going to be a big change.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.080]   We own everything outright.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.960]   There's not really any risk.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   I got $40,000.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   How am I going to replace that?
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.240]   And so you can do this valuation with real estate.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:27.280]   He may go out and say, well, if I'm going to take the money that he's going to pay me,
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.860]   then how many houses do I need to buy to replace my $40,000 a year free and clear?
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:36.400]   And that's going to be the most compelling valuation.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.920]   Because the same question, let's say that a guy calls me and says, should I sell this
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.520]   investment and buy a different one?
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.820]   Well, the answer is, what are you going to replace it with?
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:55.780]   And virtually all of the things that he could replace it with to get $40,000 of income,
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:00.160]   all the things that he could replace it with are probably going to be on the level of,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.360]   again, that million dollars.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.260]   So that's the second level of valuation.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:09.720]   And then the problem is then you have a third level of valuation, which is, what is it going
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.000]   to take for me to feel secure?
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.300]   Or what is it going to take for me to be confident that this was the right move?
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:21.580]   So in this discussion with two owners, and one owner wants to pass it along to the son
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:27.060]   and kind of get them involved, then if I'm the guy who's being asked to sell, I'm going
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.900]   to be thinking about, what are the growth prospects here?
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:44.020]   What if we can grow this thing and now my share can turn not from $40,000 but into $75,000?
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.780]   How do I get better than that?
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.900]   And so there's the walkaway number, and the walkaway number is usually the highest.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:56.260]   And so I think I've ordered these numbers and what I think would usually be the three
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.520]   numbers.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.980]   Number one is going to be – and we can argue about the order a little bit, but usually
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.740]   the industry average is going to be the lowest.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.960]   Then the how do I replace this is going to be significantly higher.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.540]   And then in many cases, the walkaway number of here's what it takes for me to walk away
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:17.100]   happily today is going to be the real number that we're going to get to, but that's often
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:24.140]   going to be the highest because it's not tied to any specific outcome.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.700]   It's just a number that feels good.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.220]   Okay, that's definitely enough money.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.820]   You can be ridiculous about it.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.660]   If somebody walked in here and offered us $5 million for this bar, we'd sell today,
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.660]   obviously.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.140]   Well, no one's going to do that.
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:41.280]   So we're coming down from it, but what that actual walkaway number is, is going to vary.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:48.020]   So the pathway that I would see that might result in some kind of successful negotiation
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:54.140]   is going to be less about the valuation of the business and more about the settling of
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.860]   the life path.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.380]   Why would somebody want to sell in the first place?
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.020]   For example, I might be getting older.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.780]   I might not want to come in to do the work, etc.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:05.100]   All right, well, you want to sell.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100]   What do you need from it?
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.140]   Well, I need income.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:13.500]   And so maybe we can have a higher buyout number, but we can deliver it in the form of income
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:17.760]   payments that are going to come in for 15 years or 10 years because that's a way of
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.620]   satisfying both of those things, that I'm getting a higher number, but the number instead
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:26.460]   of being paid out up front is being paid out of the profits of the business.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.700]   I don't know what all the other alternatives are because I don't know their situation,
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:36.300]   but I would try that track to understand why they would want to sell.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:40.500]   And the person who wants to buy out his brother, he's going to need to build a case that would
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.780]   cause the seller to want to sell.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.740]   And that's going to involve the number.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.460]   It's going to have to be high enough to make it better.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:55.260]   And it's also going to probably need to involve some alternative pathway because most people
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:58.280]   are not investors, especially most business owners.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.740]   And so they've got comfort and experience with the bar.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:06.180]   You can't just build that same confidence in with, "Hey, here's a mutual fund or here's
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   a piece of real estate.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   It's a different market."
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:13.380]   So, I don't know that I'm giving you any insight, but there is no one number.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.580]   There are at least those three numbers.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.580]   Okay.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:23.020]   That at least gives us a starting point.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.300]   Any successful negotiation is going to have to be win-win.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:32.220]   And so the person who wants to convince his brother to sell has to sit down and say, "What
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.860]   does my brother want?
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.780]   What does he actually want?"
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:48.980]   And in order for the brother to sell without causing harm to the family relationships,
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:56.180]   the brother has to be persuaded without coercion that selling is better than keeping and that
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.620]   he's better off selling than keeping.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.780]   And that often requires some creativity.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.260]   So I would ask myself if I had a son and I'm trying to convince my brother to sell me half
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:16.100]   of a business, then I might do something like say, "Let's set the baseline of what our business
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:23.780]   has been and maybe we sell over a period of time as my son is able to increase the profits
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.300]   of the business."
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:35.260]   And if he can increase profits by 50%, then not only will we make some money because we
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.620]   brought him in, but now here's a vesting schedule and we're going to sell out 5% of the business
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.500]   to him per year as he's able to increase the profits.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   I don't know.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.780]   Some kind of creative solution.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:54.220]   But you've got to begin with what's going to cause the selling brother to be happier
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:58.220]   after having sold than he was when he had it.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.620]   And that's the only way of navigating this without bringing harm to the family relationships.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.100]   It has to be a genuine deal where both people are better off.
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.100]   Okay.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.620]   All right.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.180]   Thank you.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.180]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.180]   Hard question.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.780]   I don't know if there's a solution, but that's where I would begin to work on one.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.580]   Joe Sellius in North Carolina.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   Welcome to the show.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   How are you today?
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   Hi.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   This is Jose Luis.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   Jose Luis.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   There we go.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   I don't know why.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.020]   I looked at your name and it said Joe Sellius, and I should have seen Jose Luis.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020]   Sorry about that.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   That's funny.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   That's very common, actually.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:40.620]   Now you know your fake name to use whenever you want to convince people of it.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   Joe Sellius.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620]   Yes.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   Oh, I've heard that before many times.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.260]   So this question is about homeschooling and behavior.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:54.420]   Most of the time our homeschooling goes smoothly.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:18:00.180]   Sometimes our son, who is almost eight and a half, he delays and complains, and that
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.900]   ruins the mood and ruins pretty much the day.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:10.540]   I remember that in a past episode, you mentioned that I think it was your oldest son that maybe
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:16.300]   initially had some behavior issues related to homeschooling, and you had to step in.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:20.140]   I would like to know if you have some strategies that you can share that work, that maybe you
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.140]   still use.
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.580]   Specifically, I would like to know if you actually use deadlines, like do you have to
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:29.780]   do this math by certain time before you move on, and if you don't do this, what happens?
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   Sure.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.780]   Anyway.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.780]   It's about behavior and compliance.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.500]   So let's begin with acknowledging a couple of the facts that you just shared.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.180]   You have an eight-year-old and you have a boy.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:48.340]   So one of the reasons that I myself homeschool, and I especially would want to homeschool
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:56.380]   an eight-year-old boy, is quite simply that school, generally speaking, is a toxic environment
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.700]   for boys.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:06.060]   It's a toxic environment because all of the things that make a school run smoothly are
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.300]   unnatural for boys.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.940]   Sitting still in a chair to focus on a piece of paper and keep your pencil moving for long
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:21.460]   periods of time, to show deference and respect to the teacher standing in front of the class,
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:27.220]   to do that for hours and hours every day, frequently with quite boring subject matter
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:32.840]   that kills the mind, this is not something that boys generally do well in.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.820]   And I think this is one of many reasons why boys are consistently falling behind.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:45.500]   Girls thrive in that environment, and what has happened in the school system is that
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:52.060]   the entire structure of the industrial school system has been reoriented for the success
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.580]   of girls and for the failure of boys.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.940]   You have primarily female teachers who create a very feminine environment, and it's an environment
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:08.140]   that works beautifully for the strengths of girls, and it's an environment that works
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:12.100]   almost exactly the opposite of the strengths for boys.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:17.900]   And so one of the reasons I homeschool is I don't want my young boys to be in that toxic
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:24.740]   environment where they're going to wind up facing nonstop disciplinary actions.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.460]   They're going to wind up facing nonstop feeling like they're always the problem just because
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:34.420]   they want to move while they read, and they want to bounce up and down and yell, etc.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:40.620]   And worse, they might wind up drugged and diagnosed with some wacky condition and drugged.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.300]   It's entirely toxic for boys.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.900]   And I would encourage you to think seriously about it, because what you don't want to do
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:53.440]   in a homeschool environment is take the toxicity of the industrial school system and then insert
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.800]   that into your home environment.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.040]   And that's what I think many people do.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:05.220]   And so I'm trying to be picturesque to point out the problem.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:11.020]   This is one of the reasons that's very important to me as to why I want to homeschool, especially
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020]   in the younger years.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:22.200]   Now, all these things can be worked out, but it's astonishing to me how beautifully well
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:30.400]   my eight-year-old daughter adapts herself to long school days as compared to her ten
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.580]   and her six-year-old brothers, who are completely different.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:40.440]   And we need to be aware of that, because in homeschooling environment, we do not need
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:46.960]   to try to force an industrial system onto a child before the child is ready.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.180]   And at eight, a child is probably just barely ready.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:57.380]   Now, I'm not saying – I myself, I'm not an unschooling advocate, nor am I a wild and
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.680]   free advocate.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.780]   I think that there's a balance.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.760]   But we should begin with the fact that we're looking to help and set our students up for
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.960]   success, not for failure.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.820]   So my goal is not to create an environment that's going to lead to failure, but rather
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:17.940]   create an environment that's going to lead to success and is going to lead to increasing
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.460]   levels of skill over time.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:27.380]   And I really want to protect the ego of a young child, and I want him to feel like he
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.380]   can win.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:34.520]   I want him to feel like he can succeed, especially in the early years, because psychologically,
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:41.420]   if he views himself as defective or inferior in some way, that has very damaging long-term
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.100]   results.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:47.860]   So with an eight-year-old, I think you should begin at the level of your curriculum.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:56.180]   Is your curriculum something that is going – that works well not only for boys in general
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:00.540]   and eight-year-old boys in particular, but is it something that's going to work well
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.900]   for your particular eight-year-old boy?
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.380]   And I'm going to – I'm speaking broadly.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:11.940]   You have to figure out how to apply this stuff, but this is a very big deal to me.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:16.860]   One of the complaints – be careful, because I'm not complaining, but I'm not attracted,
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:20.660]   for example, to most worksheet-based curricula.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.100]   I don't think that they're useful.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   I don't think they're helpful.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.380]   They don't inspire the mind.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.100]   They don't engage with the mind.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:30.620]   And so look at your curricula and ask yourself, if I'm an eight-year-old boy, is this curriculum
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:34.100]   that we're going through, is this something that's going to engage with me?
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:38.620]   Is this something that's going to inspire me to want to learn?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.940]   Because we don't want learning to taste like eating sawdust.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:48.460]   We want learning to be as appetizing as possible, especially in the early years, because our
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:55.860]   most important goal in the young years of education should not be to try to maintain
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.080]   – to try to stick to some external schedule.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:06.580]   There is no schedule anywhere in the United States of what any particular child is always
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.060]   capable of doing.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:12.540]   Different people have different ideas on curriculum and etc., but it's all made up.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.180]   There's no national standard.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.380]   There's generally no state-level standard.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:22.260]   In the younger years, you have complete and total freedom to do anything that you want.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:27.940]   And all you're basically trying to do is give basic skills and inspire a love of learning.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.180]   Those are the goals.
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.300]   And I want to do both of them.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.260]   And if I have to err, I want to err on the side of inspiring the mind and inspiring a
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.340]   love of learning rather than even the basic skills.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.500]   Because the basic skills can come very easily when the student is ready for it, but if we
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:48.980]   destroy the love of learning with an oppressive environment, then that's not so great.
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:54.700]   So look at the curriculum and then look at what the child is attracted to and say, "Can
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.020]   I emphasize these things?
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:59.260]   And do I have to do these other things?"
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.580]   So I'll give a few examples from my own experience.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:07.820]   Number one, ask yourself, "Is this thing that we're going to do even necessary?"
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.060]   So things like spelling, you know, spelling worksheets.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.820]   These are a common component of elementary school curricula.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:20.020]   I don't know if they're necessary or not, but so far right now as one homeschooling
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.980]   dad, I've just tossed them out.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:23.700]   I don't see any point.
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:30.660]   My answer is, my guess is that let's just put in a few more thousands of pages of reading
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.860]   and probably the spelling will mostly fix itself and it really doesn't matter right
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.860]   now.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.820]   So let's just set that aside because here's this thing that's dreadfully dull, dreadfully
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.380]   like uninteresting.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:47.140]   Let's just toss spelling aside and let's just focus on more reading.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.460]   And then, now is that true or not?
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   I don't know.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.100]   But if I have a child who's fighting a spelling worksheet, maybe it doesn't need to be done
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100]   right now.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.460]   So here's another example.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:03.140]   Is there a way that we can keep making progress, but progress on a level that's appropriate?
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:10.620]   So my eldest child, now 10, he was horrific at writing.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:15.500]   Writing, which is considered to be kind of a standard thing that elementary school students
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:19.480]   are supposed to be, he had an enormous pencil allergy.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:23.100]   And I think that most young boys have an enormous pencil allergy.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:27.540]   And he would go through worksheets and workbooks of let's practice letter formation and whatnot
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.900]   and none of it worked.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.660]   It was like pulling teeth.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:35.380]   And so, we have to impose discipline, we have to say you have to finish this, you have to
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.380]   write it.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:41.100]   And a boy will find every excuse to sit and dawdle for hours over this thing that he doesn't
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.340]   like to do.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.980]   And so I tried to understand what is actually happening, what's going on here.
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.140]   So first of all, when you're dealing with very young children, just toss the whole thing
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.620]   out for three months.
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:54.980]   And if you're struggling with something, whatever it is, just come back in three months, try
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.980]   it again.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.460]   If it doesn't work in three months, we'll try it in another three months.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:03.300]   Again, you're under no external obligations to be on any particular schedule.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.300]   And so I tossed the writing curriculum, I said, we're not doing that.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:14.980]   And so a year ago, I had a nine-year-old child who is reading at a college level and can't
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.140]   write at a first grade level.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:22.460]   But to me, that's not a problem because one of the reasons I homeschool is so that we
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:29.220]   don't have to fit a standardized median approach, but rather so we can help each student to
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:35.420]   advance right at the frontier of learning in an appropriate way.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:41.580]   So what I mean is that only in an industrial school system do you need to be writing on
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:45.680]   a fifth grade level and reading on a fifth grade level and doing math on a fifth grade
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.180]   level and whatever the other skills are.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.940]   In homeschooling, you don't need to do that.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.320]   You can be reading on a college level and writing at a first grade level.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.140]   And as long as you are aware of the deficiencies and aware of what you're working towards,
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.140]   then no problem.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.140]   We'll work towards it.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.140]   And over the coming months, we'll make progress.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:08.700]   The goal is not to stay behind forever, but we want to be careful and not try to feel
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.280]   like we're on someone else's imposed schedule.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.920]   So with the writing, what I did, how I dealt with that was, number one, as I tried to see,
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.560]   is there any evidence that my child has a learning disability?
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.460]   Some expression of dysgraphia or etc.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.260]   I couldn't detect any evidence of anything fundamentally wrong.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.900]   I just figured I've got a boy here who doesn't like to write.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.900]   No problem.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:35.900]   I can deal with that.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:41.860]   I scrapped writing and I brought in art because one of the reasons that young children don't
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.740]   like to write is because it literally hurts.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.900]   Their hands hurt from holding pencils and things.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.380]   So I brought in art and I said, let's just do lots of art.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.380]   What are we doing with art?
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.640]   Well, it's fun.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.660]   The children enjoy drawing, but we're building up those pencil skills.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:29:04.420]   It's the same basic function of motor control and building up the strength in the hands
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.580]   as is writing words, but we're just approaching it in a different way.
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.220]   So we did that and we did that for several months.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.700]   And then I figured out that in order to write effectively, what we want to do is we want
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.860]   to pull apart the act of writing from the act of composing.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.420]   So being a skilled writer is two basic skills.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:31.300]   It involves the skill of taking abstract thoughts and turning them into words.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:38.140]   And secondly, it involves the skill of putting words down on paper in the artificial manner
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:43.100]   that is writing, which is not like the way that we speak and doing proper punctuation,
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.860]   spacing, et cetera.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.860]   And I mean, if we went back a year and a half, year and a year ago, and I showed you my son's
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.760]   writing papers, it was terrible.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:30:00.460]   He could form the letters, but no spacing, no sense of spacing, no sense of scale, et
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.460]   cetera.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   None of that worked.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.780]   So I pulled those apart.
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:08.500]   And so I said, "We're going to begin by focusing a lot on narration."
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.140]   And the narration that we were doing in our family was quite weak, and I was trying to
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.740]   figure out what to do about it.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.940]   And so I just really started focusing on narration.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:25.000]   And so I'm practicing hand strength with drawing, with art, and I'm practicing formulating ideas
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.700]   with narration.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.780]   Narration just means, "Hey, tell me about the chapter of the book that you just read,"
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.740]   or "Tell me about the page," or whatever it happens to be.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.820]   That's narration.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.060]   And the child is practicing taking abstract thoughts and turning them into words.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.780]   That's what narration does.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:42.180]   Then I came back to it, I can't remember, four or five months later, and then I introduced
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.820]   copy work, a new book, a new copy work.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:52.540]   And what I found was that there was an enormous difference between the four months prior and
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.100]   now.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:31:02.340]   And so now we went in one year from being way behind "grade level" to now being substantially
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.700]   ahead of "grade level," as best I can tell, by just giving some time and working on those
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.020]   basic skills.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:16.120]   And I did it without needing to resort to a whole lot of problems and challenges, etc.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.260]   So if you're getting feedback, pushback, a lot of negative energy, I think we should
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:25.800]   first take responsibility for that and say, "Before I try to impose discipline or force
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:30.820]   a student to do something, can I change something about the task or the environment that would
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.140]   help him to succeed?"
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:35.980]   A couple more examples from just practical stuff.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   Math, right?
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.980]   Math is often a challenge.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.540]   So once again, what is the challenge with math?
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:48.460]   Well, math doesn't need to be done formally at a young age.
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.580]   It's something that can be deferred with no problem.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:55.860]   You don't really need to do any formal workbook math until fifth grade, and you can make up
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.540]   whatever you're behind in a few months in fifth grade.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.420]   So let's give ourselves a break.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:06.020]   But let's look for, let's try a curriculum that appeals to us.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.020]   Let's break it apart.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:12.060]   So what I do whenever there's a problem is I try to say, "How can we dial back the ease
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.060]   just a little bit?"
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:22.540]   So I view resistance, if I get resistance as either complaining or dawdling or resistance
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:27.540]   of any form, I just say, "Let's go back a level and make it a level easier."
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:31.920]   So with reading, if there's something that I've assigned to be read, read with the eyes,
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:36.000]   and there's resistance, then the first thing I do is say, "Let me make the reading shorter."
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.780]   Instead of it being a 30-minute reading, let's make it a 10-minute reading.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.300]   Or before that, I'll do, "Let's keep it a 30-minute reading, but let's add an audiobook."
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:48.460]   If that didn't work and there's still resistance, then let's pull it back from a 30-minute
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:51.460]   reading to a 15-minute reading with an audiobook.
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:55.780]   If that doesn't work, let's pull it back to a 15-minute reading with dad doing the reading,
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:00.020]   because now we have a relational dynamic and it's not impersonal with an audiobook narration.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:03.380]   If that doesn't work, let's just toss the book aside, let's come back to it in three
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:04.980]   months and let's try it in three months.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:09.740]   And every time I do that, I find that three months is kind of magical, six months is magical
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.780]   and everything gets a little bit better.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:17.380]   So I don't think that we should focus first and foremost on discipline, et cetera, especially
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.380]   at the younger age.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:25.460]   Now, flipping, the ability to concentrate is a superpower that we want to develop in
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.660]   a student.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   So let's focus on approaching it as a skill to be developed rather than as something that
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.920]   has to be overcome with discipline.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.460]   So with my, this has been with both of my older children, math is what I have chosen
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:51.340]   to use as the application of that, because math is hard.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.540]   And I teach my children, why do we do math?
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:56.500]   We do math because math is hard and math makes us smart.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.540]   We don't do it because it's useful.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.720]   We don't do it because you need it.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.940]   We do it because it's hard.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:00.940]   It's a workout.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.340]   It's making our brain smart.
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:08.780]   And so let's start and let's figure out what is the amount of focused math that we can
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:14.900]   do that doesn't result in loss of focus and loss of concentration.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:21.300]   So I had some significant challenges with my daughter, my eight-year-old daughter, and
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.420]   I spent some time and I pulled it back to exactly this.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.180]   Let's focus on math for 15 minutes and I'm going to make it as easy as possible.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.460]   I'm going to sit next to you.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.340]   I'm going to sit next to you while you do math and let's remove all the distractions
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:37.220]   and let's see how many minutes of focused activity we can do.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:41.700]   And then as soon as we lose focus, let's stop and let's see if we can do more tomorrow.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.120]   So if we did eight minutes of focused work today, great, wonderful.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.180]   Let's see if we can get to nine minutes and nine minutes and stop and 10 minutes and stop,
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.180]   etc.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:54.700]   And I found that to work really effectively is let's pull back the scale of it and let's
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:35:00.820]   focus on doing what we can do and then when we reach the limit, let's stop there.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.100]   And I think that that's also a better model.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.220]   Once we've – and think of it like weightlifting.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:09.380]   You don't take your eight-year-old into a gym and put a 200-pound barbell on his back
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.740]   and say squat.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.100]   You say let's start with how many squats can you do right with body weight.
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.260]   Then what can we – how much squat can you do with a bar with good form?
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.740]   And you want to keep adding the weight steadily but you want to be doing it with good form.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:27.080]   And I think the same basic principle applies to homeschooling.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:32.500]   So before we get to anything of rewards or punishments or if you're not done in this
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:40.180]   time, let's do all of that stuff first and then let's bring in any additional systems
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:41.540]   that we need.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:46.280]   But in general, I think that – I'm trying to think for a moment.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:58.300]   I am not currently using any form of rewards or penalties or any of those things because
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.420]   I don't see that that's helpful.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:07.140]   I think that it's better to focus on the core of what we're doing and then go from there.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:13.660]   So right now, your school day should be probably two hours, maybe three hours maximum.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:19.000]   It should be broken up into 10 to 15-minute lessons.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.700]   No lesson should be longer than about 15 minutes and there should be a big fat break.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.980]   Before school, there should be a whole big play outside session with lots of energy and
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   lots of movement.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:33.340]   There should be a big fat play outside session right in the middle and then you should be
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.060]   done and go from there.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:41.020]   And if you look at it and say, where are we going over time, then – and let me give
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.860]   one more example, practical example because I can actually speak practically on this.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:49.460]   I have a six-year-old boy who is doing school.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:55.260]   The problem is that he doesn't seem to have much interest in academic stuff.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:01.940]   So we keep bringing in a little measure and so we had an exciting start to first grade.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:06.180]   Okay, let's go through and let's do some workbooks and things like that.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.380]   Well, this boy is not interested in reading.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.300]   He's just not interested, doesn't want to learn to read.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.120]   You go through the same thing, just not grasping it.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:19.200]   So my wife scrapped the entire curriculum and she inserted night training.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.060]   And so quite literally, she built – I forget what she calls it but those things that you
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:27.500]   take a lance and you joust with and put the younger boys on their bicycle and they go
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.780]   out and they do night training every day and we have swords, we do sword fighting and we
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.380]   do night training, et cetera.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:34.060]   All those things, they're all physical.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.340]   He's a super physical child.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:42.340]   But I'm not going to give up on the skill, I'm just going to focus on what we can do.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:49.780]   And so we use one – a couple of – I found a video-based learn to read program that we
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.620]   do for 10 minutes every day.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.380]   I don't require performance on it, I just require 10 minutes of input.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:59.940]   And then I'm focusing on concentration with audiobook listening.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.580]   And so I require a certain amount of audiobook listening.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.380]   He doesn't have to read with his ears – sorry, with his eyes but he does have to read with
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380]   his ears.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.520]   And we do a lot of reading aloud too.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.820]   My wife does a lot of reading aloud.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.580]   We do art, we do picture study, we do all the other stuff.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:17.700]   And so I'm seeing this work with this child who is very resistant to learning to read
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.900]   and I would expect that – I don't know if it will happen six months from now, a year
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:21.900]   from now.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.300]   I would expect that the learning to read thing will just naturally solve itself.
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:29.940]   It seems to resolve – most of these problems seem to resolve themselves with either a few
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:36.140]   more trips of the moon around the earth or in some cases, a couple more trips, revolutions
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.740]   of the earth about the sun.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:44.340]   So these approaches I think should be our primary thing, especially at a young age and
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:50.380]   don't resort to discipline or punishments or etc. unless you've gone through a long
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:57.220]   list of these approaches – making the curriculum more attractive, bringing it down to its level,
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:01.460]   shortening the lessons up, requiring total concentration for five minutes and then being
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:02.460]   done.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:08.380]   Do all of that stuff before you get to punishments, rewards, things like that.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380]   Excellent.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:11.980]   This is very helpful.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:20.500]   It has opened the doors to a new approach to our problem that we haven't considered.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.500]   Good.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.500]   I'm glad.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.500]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.740]   Yeah, I tried to give you as many practical examples as I could from this perspective
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:34.000]   and even if we were dealing with a teenager, I think the same basic psychology applies
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:41.460]   is let's celebrate what we can do and let's focus on what we can do and let's be super
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:45.780]   focused on building these things as muscles, as skills.
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:47.580]   I do talk to my children about this.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:54.740]   I don't allow things like toys at the desk and my comment to them is that I teach them
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:59.420]   your basic superpower in the fullness of time as an adult is going to be your ability to
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:05.800]   do deep work, your ability to focus on hard tasks for extended periods of time.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.700]   That's what we're developing but we're not going to get there in a month or even a year.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.880]   It's going to be multiple years but we're not going to sabotage ourselves.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.580]   So we don't have to do an hour of deep work at this stage.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.500]   What we do need to do though is keep the toys off the desk and then celebrate what we can
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:22.500]   do.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:29.300]   So don't take the structure – recognize that schooling in a school system and homeschooling
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:34.220]   or home education, better said, are very different things.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:42.420]   The reason schools need schoolteachers is that teaching a classroom of 30 young people
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:50.060]   is a very specialized skill set where you need specialized training in classroom management
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:56.600]   and psychological control and you have to build all these systems to keep a classroom
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.380]   of 30 students on task.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.400]   But in your home, you don't need any of those things.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:10.980]   You need an engaged adult who is able to look where the child is and bring the child to
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:16.940]   appropriate educational resources and provide some structure to it and you can make enormous
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:20.440]   advances in that context and it doesn't need to be painful.
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.660]   So anytime you get up against that level of pain, drop back a little bit, reassess and
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:29.020]   then come back and three months now, six months from now, you'll find that probably the pain
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020]   is gone.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.900]   Lucas in New Jersey, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:39.900]   Hey Joshua, I had a question for you, a fairly simple one.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:45.820]   How would you think about what services to outsource for someone who struggles to ask
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:53.940]   for help in general but also I'm a new business owner, I have a W2 job and that's all part
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.260]   of the plan but time is getting really short.
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:00.300]   So any tips on what to outsource, things like house cleaning, accounting, lawn care, is
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.300]   there a philosophy here that you maintain?
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:07.060]   Have you done a personalized time study, a time diary, a time journal for yourself?
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.100]   No, I haven't.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:15.460]   So I think before you ask that bigger question, you need to collect some data for yourself
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:23.460]   and so I would commend to you a personalized time diary where you actually just track everything
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:29.340]   that you do, ideally for a week and get a sense of what you're doing.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:35.500]   There are a variety of apps for it, the one I use is called Timelines for iOS, I really
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.860]   like it, it's the best, I've tried half a dozen of them but the one called Timelines
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:45.180]   for iOS is really good and I'm looking at my tracking right now that says recording
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:50.060]   podcast and so I can go back and look at my week's data, I can go back and look at exactly
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:56.100]   how many minutes I have saved and that is a really helpful idea to get a sense of where
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:02.780]   your time is currently going because before you decide what tasks to outsource, you want
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:08.020]   to begin with where is the time actually going.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:15.620]   Then I think there is a really phenomenal, let me just refer you to this resource, there
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:20.820]   is a fabulous new YouTube channel by this guy, forget his name but the YouTube channel
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:25.260]   is called Spoon Fed Study, Spoon Fed Study.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:31.980]   The dude's really, really sharp and he's a doctor, went to Harvard, then did his residency
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:38.140]   at Yale and went back to Harvard, I don't know, Ivy League guy, super smart and he just
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:45.860]   released a study or a video that inspired me this week where he gave his formula for
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:52.420]   increasing, I can't remember what he titled his video but if you look up Spoon Fed Study,
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:54.260]   you'll see it as the most recent one.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.260]   But the basic formula that he described is start with a time journal, number one is a
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:06.220]   time journal, number two is assign a dollar value to all of the activities that are in
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:09.860]   your time diary.
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:14.220]   Some activities are fairly easily calculated.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.140]   Your job, your W2 job is probably the easiest one.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:22.140]   You might say I have 40 hours and you know based upon your annual income and maybe you
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:26.980]   put in your commuting time, etc., my hourly rate is $50, okay, great, now you know that.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.740]   Your side hustle, your business, you might look at that and say my hourly rate here is
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:31.740]   $80.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:36.140]   But you would also want to include into your hourly rate, the other things that he recommends
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.780]   and this was the novel twist that I really appreciated, is you want to assign positive
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:45.020]   dollar values and negative dollar values to other things that you do.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:51.580]   So you might include exercise, you would say well my exercise time is $250 an hour because
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:56.020]   after all if I can stay healthy, this is going to be of an enormous payoff for me.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:02.220]   However my drinking beer time is minus $300 or my TikTok time is minus $300, this is a
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.980]   negative activity.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:09.900]   And then what he focused on is then you create a daily score and the way that you score yourself
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:18.100]   is you try to get your daily money score up to the highest level and there are three levels
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.100]   to that.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.100]   Number one, you eliminate.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.100]   Number two, you add in.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:26.420]   But then number three, you compound so you outsource and you go through and you start
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:33.020]   thinking what could I outsource and if you find, but you need that data to do that.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:39.300]   Now I confess I'm not great at this, I'm a pretty bad outsourcer, I'm a pretty bad manager,
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.140]   I don't enjoy that process, I never have.
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:47.780]   I'm building the skills and I want to be better at it because it's an enormous limiting factor
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:52.340]   in my life so I'm speaking honestly that I'd like to get better at it but I can't tell
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:57.860]   you how to do it well, I only know that you need the data and then figure out what would
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:59.980]   make sense to you.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:06.460]   And in general, don't be scared of outsourcing household stuff if it's straightforward.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:11.100]   You might find that in your area you can just order in meals and you can have a private
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:15.080]   chef that brings you every three days your meals for the next three days and that might
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.780]   be an amazing use of money for you.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:23.180]   I recently had interaction or some time back I had interaction with an entrepreneur on
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:30.260]   Twitter and he had a laundry service and he had calculated the value of the laundry service
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:35.220]   where every few days or every week somebody would come to his home, pick up his laundry,
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.860]   they would take it all, they would wash it, they would fold it, they would bring everything
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:43.420]   back and he had all the numbers calculated and it was an amazing value for his life.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:46.780]   I think you're going to have to try different things and see what works.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.900]   There's some outsourcing that can work really well with big compound effect in a business.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:56.420]   If you can find the right partner, the right vendor who can really increase your leverage
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:59.200]   in a business then that can work really well.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.780]   Sometimes though it's harder to do those big wins and it might be easier to just outsource
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.180]   the simple tasks.
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:09.460]   But I can't provide any better guidance than I just refer you to Spoonfed Study, great
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:14.940]   channel, very smart guy and I really enjoy his approach to things.
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.060]   Yeah, I'll definitely take a look.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.060]   Thank you for the recommendation.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   My pleasure.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.980]   And then hopefully over the next year because I am committed, I have to grow substantially
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.580]   beyond my own personal capacity.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:33.420]   Hopefully I can share better in a future time from actual experience of things that have
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.420]   worked.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:40.420]   A lot of the stuff that I've outsourced hasn't worked and it hasn't worked great for a significant
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:44.140]   period of time and I'm probably the problem in a lot of that.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.060]   So I'm working on it as well.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:47.420]   Thomas in California, welcome to the show.
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.420]   How can I serve you today?
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.420]   Joshua, thanks for taking the call.
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:50.420]   I just had a question.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:48:02.740]   I think maybe a month ago or so you mentioned something about reading a book on the Rothschilds
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:07.900]   and you said a couple other biographies that you might have been digging into surrounding
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:12.660]   kind of like family culture and family dynasty.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.700]   I was just wondering what book were you reading and if you had other recommendations on that?
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.700]   Sure.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:20.700]   The one that I'm still reading it because I read many of the time.
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:28.820]   Right now I'm reading a book by Ben Hubbard called MBS about the ruler of Saudi Arabia
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.860]   and it is super interesting.
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:39.420]   Saudi Arabia is changing massively right now and if we compare Saudi Arabia of today to
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.140]   Saudi Arabia of five years ago, it's just night and day different.
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:49.140]   We've heard some of this stuff publicly but we know about the killing of the journalist
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:58.860]   – I can't know the name, Jirogi, I'm sorry, I can't summon his name.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:03.380]   And then also when all the Saudi princes were locked up in the Hilton for a long period
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.380]   of time.
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:07.940]   So I'm super interested in that and I'm really enjoying this biography by Ben Hubbard
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.500]   of MBS.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:15.140]   The book that I'm still reading on Rothschilds is called The House of Rothschild by Neil
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:21.220]   Ferguson and it's a big, I mean it's a 25-hour biography, I'm listening to it
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:27.260]   and it's enormous, it's a very, very thick book.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:32.220]   But it's an in-depth look at the Rothschild family and so it's called The House of
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:34.380]   Rothschild by Neil Ferguson.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.300]   I find it, I'm also finding it very interesting and working my way through that.
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:42.540]   Other biographies that I'm reading right now, those are the two biographies that I
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:43.540]   have going right now.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:53.700]   I have about six or seven other books going as well, but those are the two biographies.
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:50:00.460]   And then on that note, have you ever considered or donated reading into like a family constitution
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:04.740]   and any thoughts on that?
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.020]   Sort of, I haven't been able to take it much beyond that.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:13.140]   So these are, earlier in the show, I think before you jumped on the line, I was talking
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:25.740]   about my interest in charity and this is the other, you're bringing up the other subject.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:29.660]   So this is episode 999 of Radical Personal Finance and when I started the show, I committed
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:34.760]   to a thousand episodes and I thought that those thousand episodes were going to be really
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:40.700]   focused on, you know, just, I don't know what I thought.
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:44.020]   But anyway, I'm getting into a thousand episodes and so I've reassessed and really thought
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:47.020]   like what are my interests?
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:51.060]   What do I really want to keep on talking about?
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:56.780]   And one of the, so I have a few, but two of them have come up in today's podcast.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.860]   Number one is the charity stuff.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:05.060]   Number two is this question of family dynamics and family fortunes and family wealth.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:08.100]   Forgive me, that's my phone, what a rookie mistake.
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:12.820]   You'd think that with 999 episodes of the podcast I would have my phone on, do not disturb.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:15.340]   Forgive me.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:21.000]   One of them, one of the things that I'm super interested in is this concept of family wealth
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:32.220]   and I realized that it's an enormous hole in modern American financial planning because
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:39.340]   modern American financial planning assumes individuality as its core principle.
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:45.100]   Americans are very likely to say things like, "Oh, my son's got to make it on his own.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:48.580]   18 years old, you know, boot him out the door."
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:51.420]   Americans are very likely to say, "Well, you've got to do it on your own.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:56.300]   You know, you don't need, no concept of family wealth, no concept of family inheritance."
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:03.100]   I used to think that was the right pathway because that was the culture I was raised
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.340]   in and the values that were instilled in me.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:13.300]   Then over time, I really started to question that and it started when I considered the
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:22.780]   biblical accounts of inheritances and the concept of wealth being passed down within,
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:26.500]   you know, the patriarchal families in the Bible and things like that.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:31.220]   I started to question a lot of my assumptions and then I looked around the world and I still
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.220]   see this.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:42.380]   So, I'm fascinated by this question because basically every culture has some version of,
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:45.620]   in English we say, "shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations" and it seems
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:52.020]   like every culture has some variation of this, but I don't think it has to be that way.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:53:00.540]   And so, I'm trying to figure out what are those things that are core and really make
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.540]   the difference.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.340]   I'm pretty obsessed with this question as well.
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:11.300]   So, the concept of a family constitution is something that I can get behind, but I don't
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:15.500]   know how to do it or to implement it or to make it practical and I don't know what it
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:21.780]   means, but I'm immediately positive in my feelings towards it, but I have no idea what
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:22.780]   to do with it.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:26.900]   So, if you can teach me what you've been learning about, I would be very grateful.
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:37.460]   It's something that I'm still studying as well and I'm going to do a lot of reading
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.460]   into it.
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:45.100]   So, I'm just trying to obtain more sources before I leave.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:49.220]   Is there anything that you've found really helpful so far, any book or essay or anything
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.220]   like that?
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:53.380]   Yeah, there's a couple.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:54:00.940]   So, one book that I thought was particularly good called Stewardship in Your Family Enterprise
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:12.820]   by Dennis T. Jaffe, A-F-F-E, the Ph.D. in the subject, I've been meaning to read some
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.140]   of the other works.
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:23.940]   There was another one I read recently, it was called, I believe it was The Myth of the
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:24.940]   Silver Spoon.
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:25.940]   Okay.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.940]   Myth of the Silver Spoon?
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:33.540]   It kind of addresses the whole shirts, sleeves, just shirts, sleeves and myth of the silver
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.540]   spoon.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.540]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:46.380]   Those are, I think, the main two that addresses that I've read recently.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:50.780]   I'm fascinated by the subject as well.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:52.060]   I'm grateful for the recommendations.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:54.940]   I will get those and read those because I have not read either of those yet.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:55.940]   I have a list.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.260]   I don't remember if they're on them, if either of those is on it, but I have a list of this
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:03.740]   that I'm going to start digging more into.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:07.940]   Especially as my children start to grow out of just baby years – I mean, we've been
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:13.500]   under the tidal wave of baby stuff for a decade – but especially as we get to the fun years
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:19.680]   of integration of a lot of these things, I want to see – not only do I want to be able
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:29.140]   to do it myself – I want to build an effective, useful, influential family dynasty, but I
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:32.460]   also want to equip others to do it.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:41.100]   I think that the American model that we've naturally imbibed from our culture is wrong.
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:46.860]   It's not that it's all wrong or all useless, but it's broadly wrong.
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:51.900]   I'm not sure if it's intentionally wrong, meaning there's a vast conspiracy by the
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.420]   wealthy to not talk about how they manage their family fortunes.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:58.980]   I don't think there is, but who knows?
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:55:59.980]   Maybe there is.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:05.340]   I think it's just that we've taken our individualism and our individualistic culture
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:12.700]   to an enormous extreme, and we've made unwarranted jumps in that process.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:19.220]   Then in some cases, we've had forebears who were men of vision, but in many cases,
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:26.220]   because of the egalitarian nature of our society, it seems that a lot of people who get rich
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:35.140]   get accidentally rich, and they don't wind up knowing what to do with it in an effective
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:36.380]   way.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:42.220]   It seems like in American financial planning and the way that we think about personal finance,
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:47.540]   there are a couple of archetypes that are very common.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:53.680]   The most common archetype in formal financial planning is that of the career man who builds
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:57:01.740]   up his wealth in his retirement account, and the basic idea is you work, work, work so
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.980]   that you can save money so that you can retire, and as soon as you have enough money to retire,
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:08.300]   you retire so you can live the good life.
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:12.940]   That was what I spent an enormous amount of time thinking was the appropriate structure
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.940]   of life.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:19.300]   Well, that's a question that's all answered in the context of financial planning, because
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:20.980]   it's just a numbers calculation.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.620]   You're not trying to leave significant wealth behind to your children.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:28.420]   It's okay with half a million for each child, fine, but it's just money, it's just cash.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:36.540]   Then the second archetype that often happens is that of the unexpectedly successful businessman,
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:41.580]   the guy who starts a business, grows really big, but it grows really big really fast.
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:49.260]   I guess being a product of the '90s myself where we had the tech boom, it seems like
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:57.220]   so many of the wealthy in our society were suddenly wealthy, and so this archetype often
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:01.400]   results in just people not having a vision.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.340]   Maybe there's a set of advisors who know how to advise on this effectively, but I haven't
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:06.340]   found them yet.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:12.980]   I'm going to go look for them, but I haven't found them yet, and I don't know what they
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.980]   say.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:20.140]   Now, we have dynastic families in the United States, but some of them, a lot of them are
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.140]   just failures.
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:26.860]   I read a book on the Rockefellers last year, and you see how quickly their fortune was
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.700]   squandered.
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:38.580]   Similarly, you look at the – well, anyway, we have this entire structure of these enormous
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:39.940]   not-for-profit entities.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:46.580]   We have a lot of the institutions that our society has built, it seems like they always
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.940]   abandon their founding principles, and their founders themselves would be rolling over
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:52.720]   in their graves.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:58.560]   When I look at this, I don't see a lot of shining light examples, but yet I think we
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.340]   desperately need those shining light examples.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:04.860]   So we need to find out where are the success stories.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:09.900]   We hear stories of some of them around the world of the 1600-year-old Japanese company,
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:14.140]   but I want to find where are the success stories, what are the principles, what are the things
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:18.700]   that could work out, because I think that we're building a generation of men, perhaps
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:25.060]   like you and I, who are looking for a vision that goes beyond just retirement and are looking
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:31.700]   for a vision that goes beyond just consumption and hedonism, et cetera, but are looking to
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:32.940]   build something.
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:40.540]   But we don't seem to have that many fathers who can lay out how it's done and integrating
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:45.620]   moral character development, family culture development, with financial development as
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:47.060]   well.
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:52.140]   And I hope that we can make progress in the next decade on this area, because to me, this
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:58.380]   is a very inspiring vision, and I think it would be inspiring to a lot more men if we
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:03.940]   could articulate some of the principles, and it's something that we need as a society.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:08.460]   I wholeheartedly agree.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:17.100]   And I think the undertone of, I guess, the American culture that you can't pass on wealth
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:22.980]   and it's going to ruin your children anyway, so don't even try, is bogus.
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.860]   And I really think that there is a better way to do it.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:31.900]   And as you mentioned, passing on the moral and character values as well, having that
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:41.500]   all ingrained and entwined with the financial responsibility of stewardship, I'm hoping
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:46.820]   that the gears are turning and we're going to start to see, start to happen.
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:47.820]   I think we are.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:54.580]   I think the baby boomers, and I'm not imputing any specific baby boomers, but on the whole,
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.260]   I think you don't sound like a baby boomer to me.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:02.060]   You sound like someone who's probably similar in my own age to some degree.
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:06.420]   I think our, if I'm right about that, our generation of men, I think we look at a lot
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:13.220]   of the baby boomers and I feel a great sense of scorn for a lot of the baby boomers because
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:19.500]   many of their lives, not all, I'm generalizing clearly, but many of their lives just seem
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:26.460]   utterly shallow and meaningless and they possess enormous wealth and enormous influence and
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.860]   they seem hell-bent on spending it as fast as they can and not doing anything that's
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.260]   going to last.
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:41.420]   And so it seems like, on the whole, it seems like a generation that profited from one of
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:47.380]   the most incredible times in economic history, and yet what do we have to show from their
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.740]   culture?
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:53.100]   And it feels to a lot of men in my generation, perhaps yours as well, like we were handed
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:02:01.300]   a broken, failing culture with problems on every side, and the men who should have been
[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:06.900]   visionaries to lay out the solutions and pave them for us didn't do that.
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:11.220]   And so, and all they want to do is go and golf every day and drink up their money and
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:13.100]   now they're all potheads.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:21.060]   So it's, you know, I don't know, maybe this is just the fourth turning and this is always
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:29.180]   what happens, who knows, but it really annoys me and I don't want to be much like that,
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:30.980]   like those baby boomers that I see.
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:38.300]   I'd like to be a different old man.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.700]   So we'll press on and we'll find some solutions.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:42.580]   We'll press on.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:48.180]   If you have more solutions or resources to share, then, you know, into hearing about
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:52.140]   them and look in the research as well.
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:53.220]   I anticipate doing that.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:58.460]   So just know that this is one of my top few priorities in the coming years, that these
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:59.980]   are the subjects that interest me.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:03.860]   This is what I'm going to be digging into to try to understand and doing my best to
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.340]   learn.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:07.020]   I'm still in the reporter phase.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.300]   I don't have much to offer.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:13.620]   I'm a learner and I want to learn, but I got to find the examples, find the people who
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:17.580]   have written what they've done and then learn from them and then I'll do my best to share
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.580]   those as we go.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:25.460]   Thank you for the question.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.740]   And with that, we wrap up today's Q&A call.
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:32.820]   I hope I wasn't excessively negative there at the end.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:35.540]   That's not my goal to be negative, but we do need to be honest.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:39.740]   And again, there's always exceptions and we want to honor the exceptions.
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:48.740]   But I think we want our money to provide for ourselves, provide for those that we love,
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:55.700]   provide the luxuries, the enjoyment, the consumption, but we have been gifted a legacy by those
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:04:01.540]   who've come before us and we have a responsibility to enhance that legacy for those who come
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:02.820]   behind us.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:07.260]   And it's not enough to do it exclusively with money, but it's also not enough to do it exclusively
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.580]   with ideas.
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:11.300]   Money and ideas need to go together and that's what I see.
[02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:12.300]   Thank you for listening to today's podcast.
