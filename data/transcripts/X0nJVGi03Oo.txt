[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Another pretty interesting piece of news came from Built and if you have the Built Rewards card,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.740]   which I do and I love, you can earn points for paying rent and up to $100,000 of rent a year,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.880]   you earn 1x points with no fees, you can set it up with a rental portal, you can mail a check to
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.780]   a landlord. So anyone that has rent, I highly recommend the Built card. It's just if you're
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.480]   paying that rent, you might as well be earning points and Built points are fantastic. They have
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.700]   amazing transfer partners. Like I would trade my Amex points for Built points if that was an option.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.820]   But you don't actually need the Built card to use Built points program. In fact, you can join
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.080]   Built Rewards for free and start earning points through all the various other things they do.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.840]   They partner with tons of restaurants. So there's a bunch of great restaurants in the Bay Area and I'm
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   sure in almost every city where when you dine out at that restaurant, using any credit card you have,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.160]   you can end up earning any plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 Built points on top of that. They have a bunch
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680]   of partnerships with places like SoulCycle. They have a partnership with Lyft. If you refer someone
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.660]   who opens up a Built card, you get Built points. So there are a lot of reasons to join the Built
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.380]   Rewards program. And I think it's pretty reasonable to rack up Built points without even having the Built
