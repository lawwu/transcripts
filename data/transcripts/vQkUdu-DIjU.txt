[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   What about specialized training for grip strength?
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.240]   I believe that if somebody's large, if they can squat 500 pounds, if they can deadlift
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.880]   600 pounds, I don't really care if… the question is can you open the pickle jar?
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   Sure.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   This is a critical…
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.960]   I just get my wife to do it.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.240]   So grip strength is extremely important and you being a neuroscientist, you know the disproportional
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.320]   representation in the motor cortex of your gripping muscles and the forearm and everything.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.380]   And there is another reason why grip is so important.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.140]   So if you make a fist, if you make a very tight fist, you're going to feel the overflow
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.940]   of tension, irradiation going to other muscles.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.440]   So pretty much by gripping tighter, you are instantly increasing your strength in anything
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.120]   that you do.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.340]   And so a very simple example for your listeners, take some pedestrian exercise like curls.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.100]   And do as many strict reps as you possibly can the way you normally do them.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.080]   And then start just crushing that bar or that dumbbell or whatever that you're curling.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.300]   You will immediately be able to knock out several more reps.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.640]   So that makes you so much stronger.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.840]   And again, the value of a strong wrist and grip is obviously very important.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.740]   For whatever reason, obviously it correlates with longevity, we don't know why.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.740]   We have no idea.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.180]   Correlation is not causation, so we don't know whether getting a stronger grip is going
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.180]   to make us live longer.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.980]   But statistically, it's worth a try, right?
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.980]   So one can either find exercises that train the grip in the context of developing something
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.080]   else or train the grip directly.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.100]   So either way is great.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.420]   So the first examples would be climbing the rope or doing pull-ups and weighted pull-ups
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.420]   on a rope.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.500]   That's a great way to train, obviously.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.100]   So what you do, the way you program it is, let's say once a week you climb the rope
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.140]   and a couple of days a week you do pull-ups.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.340]   That's a good way to go about it.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.140]   And you don't need to do anything else.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.580]   And another example would be some exercises like the kettlebell snatch.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.860]   When you start snatching a heavy kettlebell and you drop it from overhead, that eccentric
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.300]   loading is very, very powerful.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.700]   And that develops grip very, very well.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.740]   And again, right now we're talking more about what people in the grip world call the crushing
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.740]   grip.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.060]   You know, how you squeeze something.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.520]   There are other types of grip that they differentiated, but this type of crushing grip is what's
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.620]   going to help most athletes and non-athletes the most.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.940]   And I will also warn you that hanging on the bar and doing farmer's carries, beneficial
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.060]   as they are for many reasons, it's not going to do that much for an athlete.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.060]   Interesting.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.020]   I started incorporating farmer's carries thinking it was going to improve my grip, but...
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.100]   They're healthy.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.020]   If you look at McGill's work, he will tell you that carrying two heavy objects, it's
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.740]   going to really pound your spine.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.860]   But on the other hand, asymmetrical carry, it appears to be very beneficial.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.340]   Then there's another interesting example.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.900]   Now right now, I'm not talking about grip training at all.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.940]   Not even talking about strength training, but I'm talking about sort of a former run.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440]   Dr. Mike Prevost, who used to work with the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy, he developed this
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   very interesting protocol and a test called the kettlebell mile, where you take a kettlebell
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.820]   that's approximately 30% of your body weight.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.100]   And he has good reasons why it has to be that way.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.620]   And you pretty much run with this kettlebell, and you switch hands as often as you want.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.980]   And it's a fantastic way to improve your running posture, to develop very stabilizing muscles,
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.500]   and to improve your ability to rock, but it doesn't beat you up as much rocking does.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.220]   Rocking carrying heavy weight, it's rough on the body.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.300]   So it's a fantastic way to train your endurance, an additional way.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.660]   - How heavy is the kettlebell?
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.900]   - 30%.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.260]   Because he says when you start going heavier, it's going to affect your gait.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.660]   So you're not really, you have to kick your hip over to the side.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.580]   It becomes something else.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.580]   - That's a heavy kettlebell.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.580]   - 30% of your body weight?
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   - Yeah.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.060]   I mean, I'm 210 pounds.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060]   It's not trivial.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.420]   So it's probably something like 62 pounds or something like that, 70 pound kettlebell.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.420]   No, no, no.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.420]   It's not trivial by any means.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.760]   But it's also not something you jump into immediately.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.900]   And also what's very cool is because you get to switch hands very often, you are not destroying
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.980]   your QL and other stabilizers that are contracting isometrically.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.100]   And so what we're doing right now here is kind of a form of anti-glycolytic training.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.620]   If your muscle contracts briefly and then relaxes, contracts, relaxes, and the contraction
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.180]   cycles are really short, you're able to avoid glycolysis, you're able to keep that muscle
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.940]   working aerobically for a long time and not beat yourself down.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.920]   So to the listeners who'd like to try it, start by walking with a kettlebell, switch
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.980]   hands often, then eventually build up to running and obviously build up gradually.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980]   - Held like a suitcase?
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.980]   - Yes.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.980]   Only, only like a suitcase.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.980]   - Okay.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.580]   So there's a podcast led by a guy named Kim Haynes.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.580]   He's a bow hunter.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.700]   He's one of the people that really brought extreme fitness and ultras to the sport of
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.620]   bow hunting and is legendary there.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.660]   And for his podcast, he has, you carry the 72-pound rock up, it's about a thousand feet
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.620]   of elevation in the Oregon wilderness.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.100]   And I've done it, it's hard because of the shape of the thing.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.780]   And so you're moving it from shoulder to, you know, to football carry, to, you know,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.780]   infant carry.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.600]   And you're not talking about that.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.780]   You're talking about suitcase on the right.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.820]   Are you trying to crush the grip while you're doing it?
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.820]   - No, no, no.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.420]   This is not developing a grip whatsoever.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.740]   - And you're running at 10, 20 minutes, 30 minutes?
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.580]   - Well, his goal, he says run for a mile.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.580]   That's the goal.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.860]   And he has some numbers.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.860]   I can give you a link.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.860]   You can look it up.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.860]   - Great.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   - Back to Mike Prevost.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.380]   And direct grip strength training is great as well.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.980]   So for example, the best products for that would be the Captains of Crush grippers from
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.980]   Iron Mind.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.980]   Iron Mind.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.620]   Iron Mind is the company that started a serious grip training pretty much in modern era.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.400]   And their grippers are the golden standard.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.480]   Some years ago, my colleague, as strong as Brad Jones and I, we decided to get serious
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.440]   about it and see what that feels like.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.280]   And we spent many, many months.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.860]   We were both able to build up to closing the number three gripper from a parallel set.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.800]   So that means that gripper takes 280 pounds to close.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.520]   And when you're using very small muscle groups, it's extremely, extremely hard.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.600]   And the observations that we both made and other colleagues and people have made that
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.120]   once you're able to do that, everything becomes so much easier.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.420]   However, the training itself is extremely hard.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.440]   Because people are thinking that when you're training the grip, it's just some kind of
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   isolated thing.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.340]   You can drive the car and you can kind of squeeze this little pink thing that you picked
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.840]   up at the department store.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   No.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.040]   When you train with a heavy-duty gripper like the one from Iron Mind, it's a full-body
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   effort.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:27.880]   And you need to use pretty much every neurological trick in the book in order to exert yourself.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:36.980]   So for example, if you have ever seen the Sanchin stance in karate, which is a stance
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.040]   where the knees are kind of pulled inward and shoulders are pressed down, there's a
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.720]   lot of tension, everything is very, very seriously engaged.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.280]   The toes are gripping the ground.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.000]   So you're pretty much gripping the ground with your toes.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.600]   You're contracting your glutes.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   You're bracing very, very hard.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   You're compressing your viscera.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.200]   Your lat is firing and you're sending all this effort.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.080]   The only thing they're not working is you try to keep your traps and face out of this.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.260]   When you're directing this effort into your grip, you get just as tired from doing that
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260]   work as from doing like heavy squats or something.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.520]   That's remarkable.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.140]   But if you like that, it's a fantastic thing to do.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.380]   The motor neuron recruitment that you are describing is phenomenal.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.860]   I have one reflection on this relationship between grip strength and longevity.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.220]   Just a little bit of neuroscience.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.480]   You may be familiar with this, so forgive me if you are, but for the listeners as well.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   The motor neurons that control movement of the torso lie closer to the midline on both
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   sides of the spinal cord.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.520]   The motor neurons that are responsible for more distal muscles, that is further from
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.200]   the midline, sit outside of those.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.500]   And so as you get out to the movement of the digits, you know, the fingers and toes, those
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.560]   are the most distal from the midline.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.100]   The rate and pattern of degeneration of motor neurons as a function of aging, even if there's
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.120]   no ALS or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or anything, is always outside in.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.280]   We don't know why this is.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.560]   It may relate to the presence of the enzyme SOD, superoxide dimutase.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:24.860]   But it does seem that people that train their peripheral strength, they can offset some
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.760]   of that outside to in, or distal to more close to the midline degeneration.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.960]   So I believe, and this is just a belief, that it's not just correlative, that when one trains
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.980]   their periphery, they actually can offset some of the degeneration.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.240]   It's also the way it's mapped in the brain, which is kind of a discussion outside of here.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.800]   We'd need to get some diagrams up for people to really conceptualize that.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:52.580]   But it's also the case if you look at older people, 70, 80, 90, their calves are generally
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.460]   atrophied even if their torso is still very thick and muscular, if they did training.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.140]   So I feel like, obviously, training the core and the torso is so key, but training the
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.000]   peripheral muscles, at least from the perspective of longevity, it makes sense why that would
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   be important.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.560]   Well, there are so many reasons, obviously, to do that.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.480]   So I think that whether you choose to do that directly with grippers, and there are some
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.680]   other devices, obviously, unlimited number of devices and exercises, or as a part of
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.240]   another exercise, like climbing the rope, definitely strongly encouraging your listeners
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   to do that.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.800]   I'm going to try this running with the kettlebell on one side.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.280]   I'll go out for a mile with it on the right, and then...
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   Oh, no, no.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   You switch all the time.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Switch as much as you want.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   Okay.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   Because if you try to do it on one side, you are going to pound your stabilizers and just
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   pound them.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.920]   You're not going to recover forever.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:50.480]   And this way, this is one of the secrets to developing isometric endurance, is very rapid
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.560]   switching, short contractions, and brief rests, and over, and over, and over.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:02.480]   That way, the muscle doesn't go into ischemia and keeps getting oxygen pretty much.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   [Music]
