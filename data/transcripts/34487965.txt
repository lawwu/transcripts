[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.760]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.440]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.960]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.160]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.920]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.680]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.320]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.960]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.560]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.200]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.660]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited to welcome you
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600]   to this Advent podcast,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   and we are drawing ever closer to Christmas,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   and the excitement at our house is palpable,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.400]   and I bet it is at your house as well.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.560]   We are going to talk today about some questions
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.000]   and some thoughts and some wonderings
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.520]   that you might want to share with your own family.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.400]   If you're looking for some great conversation starters
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.340]   about Christmas and about the spirit of Christmas,
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.440]   about the whole Advent season,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.640]   you might want to use some of this
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.240]   to start a conversation with your family
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.120]   about the mystery and the wonder of Christmas.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.740]   I have a guest today,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.760]   and in the spirit of full disclosure,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.400]   I'm gonna tell you, my guest is my husband, David.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.840]   He's a pastor,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.960]   and he is one of the best people I know
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   at finding the hidden riches in scripture,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   especially in familiar stories
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   that many of us swallow whole without chewing anymore.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.560]   And after years of reading and hearing these stories,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.280]   we just might be missing something significant.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.680]   When something is super familiar,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   I don't know if it's true for you,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.640]   but this is how it works for me.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.480]   When something is super familiar,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280]   I take it in sometimes without letting it touch me
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.200]   or change me.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.360]   Certainly, none of us want to do that
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.000]   with the Christmas story.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   David, thanks for being with me on the podcast today.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.680]   - It's my pleasure.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.480]   Glad to be able to be here with you.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.160]   - He watches or listens to me do this every week,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   and I think he wants in on it,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   and I want him in on it as often
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   as he'll come and be with us.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.600]   All right, let's talk about Christmas.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400]   A lot of times, I hear this phrase bandied about,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.000]   and so do you probably.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.200]   Christmas is really for the children.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.520]   Christmas is for the children.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.200]   But David, why is that not quite right?
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.160]   - It's funny that you and I are on the same page here,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.080]   particularly with the idea that Christmas is for children,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.400]   and it is for children,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.800]   but it's not just for children.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.640]   - Good point.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.560]   - Growing up,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   I was always kind of baffled by Christmas
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.000]   because people got so much excitement about Christmas,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and I never caught that excitement myself.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.520]   - Like friends in the neighborhood or at school
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.200]   or at church or stuff like that?
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.160]   People like that?
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.440]   - Yeah, yeah, just the neighbors
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.880]   and just the whole culture seemed to be
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.200]   so excited about Christmas,
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   and I always felt like I was missing something.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.440]   - Okay, like somebody else knew a secret
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.520]   you didn't quite know the whole truth of?
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160]   - Well,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.120]   people were into it in ways that I just didn't understand.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.280]   - Gotcha, yes, yes.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.560]   So they were excited about this or that,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   and either you weren't excited
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.600]   or your family didn't participate in the excitement that way
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.400]   or you just didn't totally get it.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.840]   - Yeah, and the family I grew up in,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   we celebrated Christmas, of course.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   - It didn't seem like a magical, special time of year.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   It just felt like, yeah, this is just what we do.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.320]   We get with family, we exchange gifts,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   and we do decorating leading up to the holiday
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.600]   and maybe some special cooking,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.080]   but it seemed to me to be missing some crucial element
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.760]   that I just, and I've actually, as an adult,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   tried to capture, even as a pastor,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.360]   trying to talk myself into being excited
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.040]   about the Christmas season.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.280]   - Right, right.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   I know that when we first got married,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.560]   we had different expectations about Christmas,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.600]   and I've come to understand
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   that it is because of our different experiences
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.640]   of Christmas as children and in our families.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.720]   - Yeah, that is true.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.680]   We had different experiences growing up,
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.520]   but we've been married a whole lot longer
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.760]   than we were children in our families.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.440]   - Right, exactly, that's what I was thinking, too.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   - And so I've tried to figure out what,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.400]   well, in the words of Charlie Brown,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.080]   what Christmas is all about.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.720]   - (laughs) Yep.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   - And, of course, Linus points Charlie Brown
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.280]   to the Christmas story from Luke chapter two.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.320]   - Right.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.880]   - But that is certainly part of it,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.280]   but that is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.120]   - Ooh.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.800]   - And so it's easy for children to get excited
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   about beautiful Christmas trees
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.520]   and special Christmas parties and meals
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   and Christmas presents and Christmas events
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.800]   like Christmas pageants and concerts.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   - Yes.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   - And so, but that only goes so far.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.880]   I mean, that seems like it's excitement
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.840]   that's just generated on the human level.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.320]   - Well, and there's lots of external stimulation
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.640]   for that kind of excitement.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440]   I mean, there are bright lights and twinkling lights,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.320]   and there is loud Christmas music everywhere you go.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.160]   - Yeah.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.800]   - And there are big Christmas trees
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.400]   and big lighted neighborhood installations.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.800]   You can hardly miss it.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.640]   - Inflatables.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.880]   - Yes, oh my word.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.640]   There's lots of external stimulation
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.680]   and everywhere you turn, it's all about Christmas
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.960]   all the time, the trappings of Christmas,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.040]   the sights and the sounds and the lights and the songs.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.000]   - Yeah, in some way, some of those trappings
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   can obscure what's really going on.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.440]   - Yeah.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.040]   - I always find New Year's Eve
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   to be completely generated out of whole cloth,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.400]   all the excitement about New Year's Eve,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.440]   'cause like we count down and then it's gonna be New Year
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.280]   and we're so excited.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.800]   It's like, yeah, but we didn't, I mean,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.880]   we know it's coming and there's no real surprise there.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.720]   - Yeah.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.520]   - And there's no real wonder of changing the number
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.240]   on your calendar.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.080]   And so I've always felt like that was just kind of
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   ginned up excitement about something that's not real.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.760]   - Yeah.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.640]   - And I don't want to feel the same way about Christmas,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.560]   that it's just something that's ginned up that's not real.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.400]   - Yeah.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.040]   - And there needs to be more substance to it.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   And that's what, that's kind of been my quest
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   as an adult trying to understand Christmas
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.000]   on more than just the intellectual level.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.080]   - Yeah, I will admit, freely admit
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.640]   that my favorite Christmas special growing up
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.160]   and even and to adulthood was Charlie Brown Christmas.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.880]   And when you were talking, I kept thinking,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.640]   I could hear Lucy's voice in my ear.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.240]   You know, Christmas is run by a big Eastern syndicate,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.480]   Charlie Brown.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.240]   And so I see what you're saying.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.760]   It's a lot of trappings and a lot of stuff
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.760]   and a lot of commercialization and a lot of taking over
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   of the Christian message.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.360]   But then you do have Linus
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   and I remember memorizing Luke two from hearing Linus.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.240]   - Right.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.720]   - All that, all those years ago from hearing that.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.520]   And that does bring the wonder back.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.040]   So I hear what you're saying.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   I bet all of us as parents feel that pain.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.200]   - Well, I think that Christmas,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.120]   we said a lot of people think it's just for the children
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.720]   and in the same way that doing chores
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   is just for the children.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.560]   Well, actually do chores to keep your home
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   functioning and clean.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.220]   And so you don't get your seven-year-old to sweep the floor
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.040]   because you think it's gonna be extra clean
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.960]   when the seven-year-old's through sweeping.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.440]   You just get them to go through the motions,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.600]   but you're teaching them something that's more important.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   It's a life skill they need to know how to do.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   And so you start with the stuff that they can understand
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.040]   and realizing that there's something
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.640]   more important underneath that.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.440]   And same thing with Christmas.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.480]   We have Christmas trees and Christmas presents
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.920]   and songs and festivities and lights on the street
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.480]   and all that, and that's fun.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.600]   I think that's good.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.960]   But that needs to lead us to something
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   that's deeper than just a lot of outward glitz
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.200]   and excitement.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.920]   There's nothing wrong with that
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   unless the glitz obscures what is really
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.480]   the heart of Christmas.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   So how can we, as parents,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   as citizens of heaven, as Christians, as believers,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.920]   as seeking people,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.720]   how can we make the Christmas story,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   the Luke 2 Christmas story,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.080]   and all the things that led up
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.560]   to the Luke 2 Christmas story,
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.640]   how can we make that fresh again?
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   What is there that we might still have to discover?
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.280]   - I think you said it well.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.400]   We're so familiar with these stories.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's Luke 2 and Matthew 1 and 2
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.400]   where we find the heart of the Christmas story.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.320]   And we're so over-familiar
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   with the Bible passages that we, as you say,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.160]   chew it up or we swallow it without tasting it as it were.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.520]   And we're so used to these stories
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.520]   that we don't ponder the meaning of them.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.600]   And if we can really dig into the scripture
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.920]   and try to understand more of the context
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.880]   in which Matthew and Luke were recording these stories,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.840]   I think that we're gonna find way more depth
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.720]   than we ever realized was there.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.960]   - All right, this is cool.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   This is where I was going.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.640]   This is what we want.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.920]   As parents, we want some talking points.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.720]   We want some ideas.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.960]   I know that you have been thinking recently
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.440]   about how the Christmas story has mystery
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.200]   and wonder about it.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.400]   Talk to us about that.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.160]   What kinds of things should we re-examine
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.920]   or what kinds of questions should we be asking our children
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.800]   or pointing them to
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.680]   so that we can have some real good conversations
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.880]   that bring us back to the wonder that is Christmas?
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.840]   - Yeah, I think just pondering what the actual stories say,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   even on the surface level, when we ponder what's there,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.480]   and when I say the surface,
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.360]   what I mean is without doing a lot of biblical background
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.600]   study and cross-references to Old Testament passages.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.440]   - Right, right, right.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.200]   So don't have to study it.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.000]   - Right, but there's a lot of value in that.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.680]   But even if you don't wanna go to that trouble,
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   just imagine what it must have been like for,
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.440]   in Matthew, Joseph is betrothed to Mary
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.840]   and turns out she's pregnant.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   Whoa, wait, what?
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.960]   Now, of course, you need to be age-appropriate
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.760]   how you talk about this stuff with children,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.040]   but that's part of the Christmas story.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.160]   You have an unwed woman who's pregnant
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   and her fiance wants to be kind to her,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.000]   but knows the noble thing to do
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.600]   is to quietly call off this wedding.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.360]   And how must Mary have felt?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   Did she try to tell Joseph what was going on?
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.080]   Probably she tried to, but,
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.360]   or maybe she didn't because it was revealed to Joseph
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.360]   in a dream that his soon-to-be wife
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.440]   was pregnant with a child by means of the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   And the angel tells Joseph in the dream
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.640]   that he's to name this child Jesus.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.080]   And so one thing we can do with our children
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.240]   is read the stories and how do you think Joseph felt?
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.640]   I mean, he was surprised.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.360]   And one thing to think about is that according to Luke,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:21.800]   Mary, for the first three months of her pregnancy,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   she was gone to visit her cousin Elizabeth,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.040]   the old woman who was suddenly pregnant for the first time.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.000]   And so Mary's been out of town for three months
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and comes back to Nazareth and, "Oh, she's pregnant, huh."
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.080]   And so we can just think about how these stories
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.000]   must have really felt in real time.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.920]   - Yeah, I was reading this story
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.240]   with a friend of mine recently,
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.920]   and her observation was there's a lot that's left out.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.800]   There are a lot of details that are left out
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   that you just think, I guess,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.960]   that that was not the important part of the story,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.840]   but it bears some thinking about.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.840]   I mean, here is this young pregnant woman
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   who is going to ride a donkey a long way to pay taxes.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.640]   So like, what was that conversation about?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.600]   I mean, Mary did it, she did it.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.800]   She went with Joseph,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.200]   but you know they must have had some conversations about,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.000]   now you want me to do what?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.760]   Now, come again, now where are we gonna stay?
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.720]   Do we have a reservation?
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.880]   You know, all of those details,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.040]   you can talk to your children about that.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.240]   When you chew on some of those specifics
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.840]   that they can relate to,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   they can relate to a long trip.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.080]   This was a long trip, not in a car to grandma's house.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.000]   This was a long trip over desert places,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.760]   on a donkey, going with hordes of other people
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.000]   to this little town that is not used to taking it.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   This is not Orlando with the Disney hotels.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.280]   This is a tiny place that's not used
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.080]   to taking in a lot of people.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.120]   And so if you just look at those kinds of details,
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.040]   it helps humanize the story somehow.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.680]   - It really does.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.200]   And we can relate to those things much better
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.520]   when we really take a minute and think about them.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   And because the stories are so familiar,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.960]   we just kind of say, well, yeah,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.200]   you know, they went from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.600]   We all know that, but to imagine what it was like
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.760]   brings out a lot of depth to the story.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.920]   But even beyond that,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.520]   this is a bizarre story.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.640]   Here's a woman who's not married,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.600]   who's pregnant and hasn't ever been with a man.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.160]   And her betrothed, her fiance,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.800]   is committed, because of communication
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   from an angel in a dream,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.640]   he's committed to taking care of this woman
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   who society said, yeah, just kind of push her aside.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.160]   So that's bizarre.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   And so then they have to travel, like you said,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.200]   about 80 miles to Bethlehem from Nazareth.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.120]   And there's nowhere to stay.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.680]   When they get there, the baby's born.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   Okay, you know, these things happen.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   But then that night, there are these strangers
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.400]   that come up and say, oh, we heard that you had a baby.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   And he's, Christ the Lord, really?
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.800]   - I mean, if I was that young mom,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.360]   I would be like, who are you?
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.720]   What are you doing here?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.400]   And how do you know that I just had a baby?
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.360]   I did not send out birth announcements.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.000]   I don't know how, and how do you know
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.320]   this is Christ the Lord?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   - Well, they show up, which is weird enough,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.160]   as in our culture, they're really awkward.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.040]   But then they tell this weird story.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.600]   Yeah, angels appeared to us out in the pasture,
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.400]   and the glory of the Lord shone round about us,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.600]   and we were so afraid.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   - But you know, Mary and Joseph,
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.560]   I mean, to us, that would be super weird.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.480]   Like, if angels appear in the backyard,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   I'm gonna be a little taken aback.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.000]   But Mary and Joseph, I mean,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.560]   they both had been visited by angels.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.320]   So when these guys tell 'em that angels appeared to 'em,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   they're probably, oh, cool, okay, happened to us.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.840]   - Well, the pieces of the puzzle
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.680]   are starting to fit together.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.160]   And the weird stories keep happening,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   because then they go to dedicate Jesus at the temple,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.080]   and again, in Luke chapter two,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.440]   and they get a lot of attention from a guy named Simeon,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.600]   who says, oh, the Lord said that I wouldn't die
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.520]   before I saw the Christ, and here he is.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.920]   And Mary's thinking, okay, well, in fact,
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.480]   Luke tells us that she stored up
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   all these things in her heart.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.680]   But these are just strange events.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.040]   Then Anna comes up and corroborates Simeon's story.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.960]   And then they, a few months later,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.600]   when they're in a house in Nazareth,
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   then these magi, these astrologers
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.800]   from the area of Persia show up,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.040]   and they're like, and they give expensive gifts?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   Well, so these are just, these are bizarre stories,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.400]   and we think about them happening.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   We realize that this is, these are weird, weird stories,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.600]   but none of that is as powerful
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.720]   as the story of the incarnation itself.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.320]   - Yeah, yeah, it actually makes sense
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.680]   for the story to be unusual and unexpected
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   because the meaning of what happened is so unusual,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.640]   although it should have been expected.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.440]   There are lots of prophecies about it.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.000]   I mean, I agree, it totally did not look like
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.760]   what anybody was expecting to happen.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.200]   - Well, they were looking for a Messiah,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.080]   and when they found out,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.360]   when people said this was Messiah, that was great.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   But this is not what even the Jews
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.240]   of the first century expected from a Messiah.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.280]   - Right, they were not looking for a baby born in a barn.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.480]   - Yeah, and even if they were looking for a newborn king,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.920]   the king was gonna grow up and,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.360]   through physical human strength, throw off the oppressors,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.880]   and so the life that he lived,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.800]   I mean, so much of this is unexpected,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.360]   but when we just ponder the whole idea
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.680]   that God could be born,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.400]   he's the creator of the world,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   and Matthew makes the point
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.000]   through his literary references
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.720]   that Jesus is the new Jerusalem.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.920]   He is the light shining.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.280]   He is heaven on earth.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.640]   And it's another iteration of God
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.040]   working to bring heaven on earth.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.160]   He started in the Garden of Eden, and that didn't work out.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   Then he finally called Abraham,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.640]   and Abraham did okay,
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.320]   but he had his own flaws.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.520]   But heaven on earth was reattempted
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.680]   through the tabernacle in the wilderness,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.040]   and so this portal, as it were,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   the portable place where God has his special presence,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.360]   and that was something that the Jews carried with them
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.160]   and then created a temple to house God's presence,
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.520]   but all of that only went so far,
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.640]   and now we have in a baby, in a person,
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.600]   here is God's presence among us in a special way,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.480]   and this is supernatural.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.520]   This is very mystical stuff,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.600]   and so when we only try to understand stuff
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.760]   on the scientific level,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.600]   it's like, oh, what was the star of Bethlehem?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.440]   Well, we had these planets in conjunction
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.280]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.200]   Okay, that's fine,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.960]   but when we really ponder
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.480]   what it means to have God coming to earth
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.200]   as a human, as a defenseless child,
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.400]   that just blows our minds,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   and I think we just need to ponder that.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.880]   - Right, what does that signify?
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.120]   That God came to us as a baby,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.520]   and how, you know, one thing that you said resonated with me,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   Jesus came to be the light of the world,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.120]   so how was this baby a light of the world?
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.720]   A light to the world?
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:49.320]   Those are questions to talk about with your family.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.480]   How did it usher in a new era?
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:03.880]   How did it forge a new relationship
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.320]   between God and His people?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.640]   How was it a light, and what does light do,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.440]   and how did Jesus do the work of light?
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.200]   How did He shine in the darkness?
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.800]   How did He illuminate things,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.160]   and how did that all start with the baby?
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   - Yeah, these are all questions
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.720]   that we need to take some time and ponder,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   just think about what it means for Jesus to be the light,
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.520]   and it's not just a light for the Jews,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.160]   but a light to the nations, to the world,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.520]   and you go back to Genesis 1,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.680]   where the first thing God said was, "Let there be light,"
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.640]   and light dispels darkness,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   but Jesus coming as a baby
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   is God on a very intimate level.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:16.400]   What is more intimate than a mother and a baby?
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   I mean, that is closeness like no other close relationship.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.160]   There's a marriage relationship,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.720]   but that's still different from a mother and a child,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.760]   and there's a lot of tenderness there,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.360]   and that's God put Himself, His Son,
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.280]   in a position to be the recipient
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.760]   of human love and tenderness,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.240]   and that's how intimate God wants to be with us.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:57.520]   - Yeah, He wants that relationship with us,
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.000]   and it's really cool when you look at all the parts
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.080]   of the Christmas story,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.080]   you see God initiating
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.760]   a new kind of relationship with people.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.400]   You had the shepherds who are interacting with God
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.240]   in a whole new way.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.200]   They never saw angels appear before,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   and they have the good news first, okay?
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   So, that's a way that God interacted with those shepherds.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.080]   - Yeah, that's a really good point
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.520]   because God revealed this to the people
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.960]   on the margins of society.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.160]   He didn't let the rich and powerful,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.800]   important people get the word first.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.040]   In fact, they were the ones who rejected the word,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.400]   and we see that in Matthew.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.520]   King Herod and all the power brokers in Jerusalem
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.960]   did not like the idea of this newborn king,
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.520]   and Herod tried to have him murdered.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.840]   - So, God, He initiated a relationship
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   through the shepherds.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   He initiated, obviously, with Mary and Joseph.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.240]   When the angel came to them,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   He was initiating a relationship of a call on them
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.200]   to be part of this story in a new way.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.920]   - Yeah, and that's kind of Jesus's mission.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.120]   I mean, He was reaching out to people
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.760]   on the edges of society all the way through,
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   and God kind of turns upside down
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.320]   common human sense.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.960]   The rich and powerful are the people
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.160]   that you need to pay attention to,
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.640]   and they're the ones that you need
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.320]   to give the information to.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   They're the ones that, humanly, you want to focus on,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.800]   but God's story is that He is reaching out
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   to the outcast, and in some ways,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.680]   in our culture, living in the United States,
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.480]   we don't really, a lot of us don't know
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.360]   what it is to be on the outside, to be outcast,
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.040]   and to realize that the people who first heard the gospel
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.200]   were people unlike us.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.040]   - Right, right.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.360]   - Who were desperate for their next meal,
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.840]   or who were oppressed by their government,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.840]   or who had been sold into slavery.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.760]   - And we don't identify with that,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.200]   but those are the people that Jesus ministered to,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   and His humble beginning was, it set the tone for,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.400]   'cause He could say, "I know what it's like to be poor.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.320]   - I know what it's like not to have a home."
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   - And He is initiating relationships with all of those.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.120]   People.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.960]   - Yeah.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   - And the very birth of Jesus is the initiation
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.600]   of a new relationship that God is eager to have
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   with those who will believe on His Son.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   And so, one really cool way to bring maybe some fresh eyes
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:38.040]   back to the Christmas story is to ask your family,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   what kind of relationship is the Lord initiating
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.480]   with you this season?
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.160]   How can you forge a new relationship with Jesus
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.480]   as you look more deeply into the Christmas story
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.700]   than perhaps you have done before?
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.280]   - Well, and I think that we can get our children
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.280]   to wonder what, as parents and grandparents,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.440]   we know what it's like to have a little child love you.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.200]   And imagine little Jesus loving His mom,
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.080]   loving His stepdad, His adopted dad,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.560]   loving His brothers and sisters that came along.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   And to be the recipient of such pure love,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.880]   and of course, other children,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.440]   their pure love is not so pure after a while.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.280]   - Right.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.240]   - But Jesus' love for us is always pure.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   And if we just ponder how profoundly
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.920]   that can change us to be loved.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.080]   I'm bad at receiving love.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.240]   And it takes some stillness,
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.500]   it takes some time just to let it soak in.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.380]   Even love expressed by another person,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   we need to ponder that and receive love from other people,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.080]   but we also need to receive love from the Lord.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.040]   And this is what Christmas is all about.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.780]   It's about God's love.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.620]   - Yeah.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.680]   - And we need to take some time as adults
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.640]   to revel in that, to soak it in.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.440]   - Yeah, that's really good.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   I can remember as a youth at my church growing up,
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.400]   I was part of a Christmas cantata
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.240]   with the adult choir and the youth choir
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.620]   and maybe the children's choir too.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.720]   And it was called "Love Came Down at Christmas."
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.520]   And as you were talking,
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.400]   it reminded me of that musical and that is true.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   Love came down at Christmas in the form of this baby.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.620]   And I think it's well worth us pondering
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.360]   what kind of love was that?
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.480]   Explore that with your family, with your children.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   In what way was God pronouncing and sharing love with us?
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.440]   And then I think it's worth exploring
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.080]   after we sit with that for a while
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.180]   and feel the love of the Lord,
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.200]   how will we reflect that love to other people?
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.160]   What could your family do to bring love,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.840]   to spread love abroad at Christmas?
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   What could your response to the Christmas story be
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.440]   if you understood it on a deeper level this year?
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.560]   - And I think we need to realize
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.060]   that we never fully comprehend it.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.560]   And if you don't grasp Christmas
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.200]   at a deeper level this year than last year,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.920]   then you're selling it short.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.160]   There's always more.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.980]   There's always more to understand about God's love for us
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   and how He is so tender toward us.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:11.440]   And just marvel at God becoming human on our behalf.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.280]   - Maybe that's it.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   That's a great place to end.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.760]   What will make the Christmas story wonderful again?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.000]   And maybe it is to marvel at the love
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   that God showed us in that manger so long ago.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.960]   I hope that as you reflect on Christmas this year
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.840]   and what the Lord is trying to share with you
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.560]   and show you through the story,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.720]   that you will be full and that you will be filled
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   and that you will be moved to serve.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.560]   Thank you for sharing, David.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.880]   I appreciate you sharing your Advent thoughts
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.220]   with us today and you'll come back.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.200]   - It was a lot of fun, yeah.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.040]   - Yeah.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.240]   And listeners, I appreciate you being with me today,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.420]   being with us as we celebrate Advent together.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:14.080]   If you are looking for ways to find community
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.160]   in the new year, I wanna give you one thing
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   to think about as we go.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.560]   The classical learning cohort
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.880]   is a made-for-you community.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.920]   As you are cultivating new skills
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.960]   and growing in confidence
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.320]   as you provide an education for your children,
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   sometimes you are looking for a group of friends
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.560]   to talk over big ideas with.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.920]   You can experience the classical learning cohort.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.880]   There is an Ask a Mentor event
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.800]   that will give you a little bit of a firsthand knowledge
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.880]   of what to expect from the classical learning cohort
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.480]   if you're not sure if you want to get involved with that.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.000]   Registration is now open.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.160]   So that registration is open now
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.040]   and it closes on the 1st of February.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.320]   So think about becoming part
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.800]   of the classical learning cohort
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.240]   and you can find out about it
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.560]   and sign up and those classes will begin
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.160]   in early February of 2025, okay?
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.600]   All right, listeners, I appreciate you
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.520]   and I will see you next week.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.100]   (gentle music)
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.160]   you
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
