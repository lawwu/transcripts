[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   You all have been on my heart and mind greatly.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.400]   I love this time together because you are in a very, very unique position in the Lord's
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   work.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.220]   You have unique access and unique opportunities to be salt and light.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.000]   And I know that the field is difficult.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   Not only challenges inherent in the discipline, but even challenges inherent in the workplace.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.880]   And so I am just so thrilled to be of any kind of encouragement to you.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.440]   And really when Ty Denae asked me if I'd be willing to speak again, not only was I eager,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.400]   but I had a passage in my mind and I just prayed that she'd allow me to do it.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.740]   And so this has been weighing on my heart for basically many years, but particularly
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.760]   the last year.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.040]   And I wanted to be as encouraging to you as it has been to my own soul on behalf of you.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.920]   And so to that very end, shall we open our time in a word of prayer?
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.560]   Our God and Father, I do thank you for what you have done, for who you are, for your immense
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.380]   genius and your immense wisdom and the glory of the scripture and the glory that from the
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.780]   scripture shines upon and illuminates the work of creation.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.240]   And I thank you for the brothers and sisters here who are endeavoring with all their heart
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.040]   to honor you.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.900]   And we ask that as we go through your word now, that there would be great encouragement,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.560]   that there would be great refreshment, that there would be great renewing of the mind
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   so that people would leave here all the more excited to do what you have positioned them
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.320]   to do and given them opportunity to do for your glory, with the full confidence that
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.220]   they are honoring you, with the full conviction that what they are doing is that which is
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.340]   utmost worshipful to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.820]   May that be captured through an inadequate vessel, but may you through that be glorified
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.340]   mightily.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.180]   And we ask this not for our sake, but so that your wisdom and your honor and your compassion
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.020]   and loving kindness would be magnified now.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.460]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.820]   Just by way of introduction, this is highly unusual for me, I'd like to recount kind of
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.980]   two anecdotes to help us frame what I'm about to talk about.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.660]   I usually don't ever tell a story and much less too, but I do feel the need in order
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.340]   to situate us properly.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.100]   And the first story actually happened at a conference just like this one.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.540]   I was standing in the back and a gentleman came up to me and he started to talk with
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.900]   me and related that he was just so discouraged, not just by the workplace he was in and the
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.980]   loneliness that was there and the opposition that he faced, but even in the work itself.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.020]   And he didn't mean that he was coming into roadblocks or obstacles or problems that he
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.340]   couldn't solve or queries that he couldn't answer.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.460]   He just was wondering, is this even worth it?
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.460]   Is this even honoring to God what I'm doing?
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.460]   And he wasn't doing anything unethical to be clear.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.380]   He had just wondered, can this even be used for the glory of God or not?
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.380]   That's what he was wondering.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.260]   And when he said these things to me, my heart broke for him.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.660]   And I wanted to encourage him because I know the sciences can be challenging and I want
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.100]   those fields and STEM and the like to be encouraged to know that there is a way and there is a
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.940]   reason why God is glorified, not just that we are salt and light in the workforce, but
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.060]   even in the work itself, even in the work itself.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.020]   And along that very line, I was, here's a second anecdote, standing in line at graduation
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.340]   this past year and a dear brother of mine, his name is Paul Twist, came up to me and
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.940]   said, "Abner, we haven't been able to talk all semester."
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.740]   And I said, "Yeah, I know."
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.260]   And he said, "You know, we've both been really busy."
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.580]   And I said, "Yeah, yeah, I get it.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.380]   And I know you're about to go in there for graduation."
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.500]   I said, "Mm-hmm."
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.540]   And he said, "But can we just have a conversation right now?"
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.080]   And I thought, "Okay."
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.860]   And they're like, "Chow, stand here, face that way."
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.280]   And Paul's like, "Paul, you're supposed to be over there."
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.100]   But he said, "Abner, I just think we've got godliness all wrong."
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.260]   And when he said that, I just stopped him and said, "Paul, it's graduation.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.300]   Do we have an issue?
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.340]   What do you mean by that?"
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:14.460]   And he said, "Often we emphasize what godliness is not, but sometimes we fail to remember
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.600]   all that godliness should be."
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.660]   And what he meant by this was that sometimes we just think godliness is avoiding certain
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:31.780]   things and doing other things, but we fail to remember that godliness is the full enjoyment
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.180]   and full approach to every single thing in our lives.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.620]   There is a way that every single experience, every single encounter, every single occasion
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.140]   and opportunity should be redeemed for the honor of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.180]   That's true godliness.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.300]   And by just emphasizing don't do this, and okay, here are three things you need to do,
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.900]   there is this huge gap of an entire area or areas of your life that actually we haven't
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.020]   been thinking about how to live godly in those areas.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.980]   Often we call this, in theology, the sacred-secular dichotomy.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.860]   We say that there are some things that are sacred, going to church, praying, reading
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.860]   your Bible.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.100]   Those are the holy things, those are the things prescribed by scripture, and that's it.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.740]   And then everything else is secular.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.420]   And not only have we divided life that way, we've even implied then that the Bible has
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.060]   no relevance on those secular so-called areas.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.900]   We need to remember that everything should become sacred.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.900]   Everything should become sacred.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.840]   Yeah, you could make something secular, that's true.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.020]   That wouldn't be right though.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.100]   Everything should be done for the glory of God.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.220]   And when you put these two stories together, the struggle of this one scientist brother
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.520]   in Christ that I was speaking of, and Paul twists his bombshell on me at graduation,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.580]   you begin to see that there is a tremendous need, a tremendous opportunity to remind us
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.220]   that there is godliness in our discipline.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:18.460]   That it's not just, even though it's absolutely important, amen and amen, to be salt and light,
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.740]   faithful witness, people of character, people of integrity, in our workforce, in our learning,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.420]   in our education, amen and amen.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:34.500]   But there is also worship that can and must happen in the work itself.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.220]   It is given by God.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.780]   The difficulty we often have because of the battles that we struggle with in our culture
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.340]   and in our society and circumstances is that we tell scientists, engineering, those in
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.540]   technology, those in math, about the wrong way to do things and not to do those things
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.980]   and we warn about it.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.540]   And yes, it is clear.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.700]   There are the categories that we call special revelation, general revelation, and knowledge.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.380]   Special revelation is like your Bible where God is abundantly clear.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.780]   He's revealing very detailed propositions about the way this world is and who he is,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.380]   that which you could never know on your own, and that is special revelation.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.420]   And then there is also general revelation, we understand that as well, which is that
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:31.060]   God through creation as an entirety, as a whole, has divulged infallible truths about
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.060]   himself.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.020]   Namely, that he exists and he is powerful and even allowing us to understand that there
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.820]   is right and wrong, but general revelation is general for a lot of reasons.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.420]   One, because it is general in its scope, it covers creation in total, it's general in
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.380]   its content, it is talking not about all the different specific, particular, detailed truths
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.660]   of God and the gospel, but just that he simply exists and he's really powerful and you and
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.180]   I are bad.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.260]   That's all that you know.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.100]   That's very, very general, and it's general in its effect.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:13.780]   It's general in its effect because people suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.580]   And so it's general in every sense of the word, beginning, middle, and end.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.220]   It's scope, it's content, it's consequence, and it's general, but it still exists.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.640]   It's enough to condemn you, it's never enough to save you.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.660]   So you have special revelation and general revelation, and in all those things God is
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.880]   still revealing.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.920]   But then you have a final characteristic, a final category, and that is the inverse
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.480]   of it all, and that's the category that we call knowledge.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:48.720]   Unlike revelation where God is revealing, God is declaring, God is disclosing, knowledge
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   is what you and I figure out.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.160]   It's what you and I discern, and it is, and it can be very specific, but it is not inerrant.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.420]   It is not necessarily infallible.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.080]   It is not necessarily always correct because we're the ones figuring it out.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.760]   And the danger that can sometimes happen, and this is what we always have to warn about,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.160]   is that we take our knowledge and we say, "Well, I'm observing things about creation
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.520]   and isn't general revelation about creation?
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.680]   Okay, so what I observe now is equal to general revelation."
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.680]   And then we're like, "And general revelation has the word revelation, so that must make
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.320]   it the same as special revelation."
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.960]   And so those are the two things, and so now what we've done is we've taken what we have
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:39.040]   observed and by a series of leaps and bounds we have made it equal to what God has said,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.360]   and he knows for a fact because he designed it that way.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.640]   That's the danger that we always face.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.040]   That's the danger inherent, that we elevate knowledge to the level of general revelation
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.680]   and then elevate that to the level of special revelation.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.040]   It's true.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   That's the dilemma of how we get so many theological issues, whether that be creation or other
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.760]   related factors in the whole equation that we're dealing with.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.280]   Nevertheless, while we can warn against these things, and they have been warned about, and
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:16.720]   so I'll just keep my comments to that, so often we haven't told and explained, but this
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.640]   is why science glorifies God.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:28.240]   This is why this thing we call STEM and all that is embraced in it can't be done as a
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.020]   noble enterprise unto the Lord.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.760]   This is why he designed it that way.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   Put it this way, we are so concerned, and as a theologian and as a leader, I am concerned
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.160]   that we don't put knowledge to the level of special revelation, amen.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:51.600]   We forget, but special revelation should be driving our knowledge, and we forget that
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.920]   side of the equation.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.180]   What my goal is for this afternoon, and I have no idea what time, okay, the clock over
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.960]   there is perfectly blinded by the light.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   I just like it.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.760]   I just appreciate that so much.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.600]   Thank you, Ty, Denae, for doing that.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.800]   That way I have no ... I'm always on time.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:20.920]   But my goal for this afternoon, as long as the Lord allows us, is to go and give you
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.600]   a starting point.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.400]   It's to go and say this, yeah, knowledge never trumps special revelation, amen, but for that
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   very reason, if you start with special revelation, you're going to be driven to realize that
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   there's a God-glorifying way to do knowledge.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.280]   There's a God-glorifying way to do knowledge, and that text that helps us know that and
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.920]   helps us capture that is Psalm 104.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   Turn there with me to Psalm 104.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:03.360]   It is noteworthy that Psalm 104 through really 107 is part of a series of passages.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.280]   It really is a part of a series of passages, and you can even hear it.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.920]   The final line is hallelujah, praise, yeah.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.280]   The Lord is being so praised that the psalmist just concludes everything with an adoration
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.560]   of him, and he's so caught up in the emotion of it, he not only expresses it, but expresses
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.360]   it with a shortened form of God's full name, because he's so caught and compelled by the
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.120]   truths therein.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.520]   But this is not just linguistically tied together as a series of psalms.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.880]   If you stop and think about it, Psalm 104 deals with creation, Psalm 105 deals with
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.160]   the life of Abraham, Psalm 106 deals with Israel's history, and then Psalm 107 deals
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.720]   with God's loving kindness all the way through.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.480]   Basically what Psalm 104 to Psalm 107 is, is it's a kind of a history book, a total
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.520]   recounting from the beginning all the way through of all that God has done for his people.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:11.920]   This is a combination, a collection of psalms that is intentionally woven together in that
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   way.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:19.360]   And within that, Psalm 104 in discussing creation, in discussing that beginning, you can already
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.280]   start to see the structure.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.440]   It's not hard to figure out, and the amount of points for this message should be obvious.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.160]   How many days are there in the creation week?
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Seven.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.000]   Guess how many points are in this message?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Seven.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Why?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.760]   Because day one, God made light and dark.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.840]   Verse two of Psalm 104, wrapping yourself with light as a cloak.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.800]   Day two, separating the sky and the sea.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.320]   Well, notice what happens.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.040]   He lays up beams in the upper chambers, walks on the wings of the wind, makes his angels
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.480]   the winds and his ministers a flaming fire.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.800]   We see day two.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   How about day three, where he separates the dry land from the water?
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.200]   He founded the earth upon its place, verse five.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.180]   He covered it with the deep as a garment.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.760]   There are mountains that are going up and down, and there are waters so that they don't
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.520]   pass over a certain boundary, verse nine.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.560]   It actually even continues in verse 10, and falling with the springs that flow throughout
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   the earth.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.680]   That's all day three, the water and the dry land.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.240]   How about day four, where he creates the sun, moon, and stars, the lesser and the greater
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   lights?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.680]   Well, you can see that in verse 19.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.280]   He made the moon for the seasons, and the sun knows the place of its setting.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.600]   How about day five, with the sea creatures and such?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.760]   Well, look at verse 24, 25, 26.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.480]   You have the sea, great and broad, creeping things are without number, and there are ships
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   even there, and the Leviathan is there.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.380]   That's the sea.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.120]   How about day six, with people and animals?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.040]   Verses 27 and following talks about how all people and animals wait for God, wait for
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.080]   God to give them their food.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.160]   What about day seven, where there is the Sabbath rest, and everything is blessed, and to be
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.320]   holy to God forever?
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.520]   Well, look at verses 31 and following.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.320]   It says, "Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.240]   Let Yahweh be glad in his works."
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   What is this?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.160]   Psalm 104 is just recounting the seven days of creation.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.280]   That's what it is.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   That's what it is.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.520]   Now, on the one hand, we can make this point, and it's worthwhile.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.680]   Sometimes people think that Genesis 1 is poetry, and they want it to be poetry so that it's
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.520]   not historical.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.400]   Okay, even though it's not poetry, there is a point to be made.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:47.480]   Go to a text like Psalm 104, which is poetry, and it's still what?
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.840]   History.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.720]   It's still historical.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.080]   The genre doesn't determine the content of what is being asserted.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.840]   Just because you tell your wife, "Roses are red, violets are blue, and I love you," she
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.160]   doesn't say back to you, "Well, you put that in poetic genre, so I don't know if that's
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.400]   historically true."
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.680]   I only accept propositional statements.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.360]   That's what I only have on my Hallmark cards.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.680]   Ten reasons I love you, period.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.560]   Now, we don't do that.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.440]   Just because a genre is a certain way doesn't determine its content.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.080]   The author determines by the way he chooses his words and the way he articulates things
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:40.280]   and portrays things, whether something is figurative or historical, abstract or concrete.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:47.800]   In Psalm 104, the way it is worded, and even that there are days, and the days are correlated,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.560]   and the days are chronological, and all these different things are an indication that Psalm
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.680]   104 is affirming, yes, God made the world six days, rested the seventh.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   That's true.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.480]   Psalm 104, as poetry, is even affirming that, and that just reinforces the whole notion
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.520]   of how we need to interpret our Bible.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.040]   True, on the one hand.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   But on the other hand, we might ask the question, "Hey, we already got Genesis 1.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.240]   Why do we need to hear about seven days all over again?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.800]   I already read it once.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.720]   I got it the first time.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.240]   Why do we need it again?
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.080]   And why are you putting it in poetry?"
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.600]   Good question, and I love this, and this is the point of the passage.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:38.060]   So crucial, because Psalm 104 isn't just repeating Genesis 1.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.520]   It does so, and it does so to reinforce the point of the nature of Genesis 1.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.120]   True, but it's not just repeating it for the sake of repetition.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.000]   What the psalmist, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, is doing is he's walking
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.600]   us through each day of creation, and he's saying, "Did you think about what God made
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   on that day?
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.680]   Did you think about all the ramifications that are true because of what he made on that
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   day?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.960]   Do you think about all the properties, and all the characteristics, and all the attributes
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.360]   that are designed carefully in what he made on that day?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.800]   Do you realize that all that God is going to do through what he created on that day?"
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:25.560]   And what we start to realize is exactly what the text says, Psalm 104 verse 24, "How numerous
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.400]   are your works, O Yahweh."
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:34.480]   Here's the key phrase, "In wisdom you have made them all."
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:42.160]   Creation in six days, God makes everything that will be leveraged for everything that
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.560]   happens in his plan.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:53.760]   In six days, everything from skies and trees to animals and man and everything is created
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:01.820]   in a certain way with certain unique properties that will carry out every single thing that
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.120]   ever happens in human history in his plan.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.840]   That's genius.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   That's genius.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:17.600]   If I gave you six days, and I said, "Assemble everything you need that you will ever encounter,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.120]   and in fact that all people will ever encounter for the rest of their existence, would you
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.840]   be able to do it?"
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.800]   If I gave you 600 days, no.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:37.200]   I mean day six, we're just forming the committee to figure it out.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.520]   And we realize God is a genius.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.440]   God is a genius.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   He speaks it, and everything is created in such a fashion that it will have ramifications
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.680]   for every single day for the rest of the days of this world.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.740]   And it has to happen a certain way.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.480]   And here's the punchline, brothers and sisters.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.760]   Your disciplines, they are aimed to do this in and of themselves, in and of themselves
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   to discover the genius of God and reflect it back to him.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:22.640]   That is what you do every single day in your acts of discovery, investigation, analysis,
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   contemplation, experimentation, whatever it is.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.440]   You are just doing exactly what the psalmist here is doing.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.800]   You are plowing into the depths of the genius of God and reflecting it back to him.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.680]   Special revelation doesn't say suspend knowledge.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   Special revelation tells us exactly how to do knowledge, and that knowledge must glorify
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.020]   God.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.020]   He set it up that way.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.200]   He set it up that way.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.320]   And so with that in mind, surprise, surprise, we're just going to be walking through the
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.680]   days of creation with the psalmist and thinking about how the psalmist thinks about these
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.240]   things and then learning from that.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.320]   That's what we're here to do.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:12.480]   The glory, the nobility, the honorability of all these disciplines is that we discover
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.400]   the genius of God.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.200]   That's what we're about.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.800]   And so with that in mind, well, where do we start?
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.080]   The beginning, day one.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:28.160]   And this is in verses 1 through 2a, verses 1 through 2a.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:35.720]   The opening reminds us that the outcome of contemplating anything in creation, and that's
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.000]   what we all do here.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.560]   We contemplate something in creation, something that is created.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:47.720]   It is this, "Bless Yahweh, O my soul, O Yahweh, my God, you are very great."
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.360]   We acknowledge that God is the highest good.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:58.240]   That is why we say, "Bless Yahweh," and we love him for his greatness, and we love him
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.920]   for his goodness, and we acknowledge this.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:08.800]   We acknowledge this because we understand special revelation as it is illuminating knowledge
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.880]   that God is glorious.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.760]   Notice the phrase, "You are clothed," as it says in verse 1, "with splendor and majesty."
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:25.480]   The word "splendor" refers to the innate impressiveness and gravitas that God has, that he is someone
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.600]   who is so mighty and so weighty in and of himself.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.680]   He is overwhelming in and of himself, and "majesty" refers to the fact that he has thereby
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.120]   an effect on everything else, overcomes everything else.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.560]   No one can resist him.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.160]   No one can oppose him.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   All fall down before him, and so who he is in and of himself, and his effect on everybody
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.640]   else, that is the sum of his glory.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.280]   You are clothed with splendor and majesty.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.080]   But here's the issue.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   We talk about God's glory, and we even struggle to come up with the words to describe the
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.660]   glory of God, and so God helps us, and this is what ties in with the first day.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.320]   What did God create on day one?
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.060]   Let there be light.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.240]   We know that.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.800]   So verse 2a, "wrapping yourself with light as a cloak."
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:24.280]   How do we know, how can we envision, how can we illustrate or make an analogy between the
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:31.720]   glory of God, which is so hard for us to express, so hard for us to explain?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:38.120]   God gives us a help, and it's in how he designed light, how he designed light.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:46.200]   The psalmist, he knows by now how God has associated his glory with light.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.440]   You can understand.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.400]   How did God guide the people of his people from Egypt?
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.720]   He was a pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.400]   We understand that.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.520]   There's light.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:04.160]   And in Genesis 15, when he's coming to Abraham, and he puts the guy out and puts him to sleep,
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.720]   so to speak, he comes as a pillar of light.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.600]   Ezekiel chapter 1, when it's describing the glory of God, it says there were flashes of
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.560]   light going to and fro, talking about the speed of God's presence.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.280]   By the way, that word "flashes of light" in Hebrew, in modern Hebrew, is actually the
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.580]   word that they use for electricity, electricity.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.180]   It's fascinating how they're conceiving of these things.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.460]   In Revelation 1, there's dazzling light.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.680]   In Daniel chapter 10, there's overwhelming purity of white, brilliant light.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.020]   And in the transfiguration, of course, there's a lot of light.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.820]   And in Isaiah chapter 9, one of the clearest demonstrations of the nature of light, it
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.340]   says this, "The light has shone.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.220]   The land is pierced in darkness, but those in darkness have seen a great," what?
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.220]   "Light."
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.500]   Light is invasive.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.960]   Light is powerful.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.060]   Light shines.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.020]   Light cannot be put out, John chapter 1.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.540]   Light is fast.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.340]   Light is flashy.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:06.260]   Light is resilient and brilliant and can be overwhelming.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.900]   All of those are descriptors of light.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.860]   And those are only descriptors of light because God made it that way on day one.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.900]   Day one.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.940]   You can't have that unless God didn't design it that way.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.740]   God designed light with all of its properties on day one.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:34.580]   And when we study light in any fashion, in any way, whether that be from electricity
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:42.100]   to light itself, any kind of energy, what we start to realize is the absoluteness of
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:47.660]   all of those characteristics that I just mentioned, all of those facets that I just described,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.940]   we start to quantify how absolute those things are.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:57.720]   And with that, then we understand the absolute majesty of the glory of God, the majesty of
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   the glory of God.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.780]   You see, God, to help us understand himself better, on day one, when he said, "Let there
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:10.140]   be light," he assigned light all of these different properties just so that we could
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.540]   study them, just like the psalmist is doing here.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:20.420]   And through them, one application is to actually understand the glory of God better.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:26.660]   Every facet, even its mystery, I know you all know better than I about these things,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.180]   but that light is a wave and a particle, and which one is it, and all these kinds of questions
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.900]   that people have, yeah, that's the point.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:41.240]   That amplifies exactly God's message about himself.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.680]   You can't contain him.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.700]   You can't even contain light, which is the analogy of him.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.460]   What makes you think you can contain him?
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:57.780]   God designed on day one that which helps us to grasp things that are very hard for us
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.140]   to grasp, namely, his glory, his glory.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.540]   Here's another one, day two, day two.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.340]   Speaking of grasping things, on the second day, we know that God made sky and sea.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:16.100]   And so, with that, the psalmist even instructs us on the nature of God as reflected in this.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.460]   God, as it says in the end of verse two, he stretches out the heavens like a tent curtain.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:27.480]   That's the aesthetic aspect of God, that he can craft the world as if a tent curtain,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.220]   taunt and smooth, and with a specific kind of curvature.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.620]   One of the cool things about when you look at the world, and you look at the earth from
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:43.400]   space, and I know Jeff Williams is here, and he'll chide me on this simple, simple observation,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.520]   but it's so smooth.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.660]   It's not wrinkly.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.340]   I can't draw straight lines or curved lines.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.980]   I can't draw anything.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.460]   So, and it's just, you know, you just feel like it's everything's a wave, you know, and
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.140]   when I try to draw waves, they become smooth.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.660]   It just doesn't work.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:11.660]   But God can shape things so that it's perfectly curved, perfectly smooth, no ruffles at the
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.540]   end.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.980]   That's a sign of his craftsmanship.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.780]   That's a sign of his brilliance.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.700]   And we say, "Well, yeah, how else are you going to make it?"
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.020]   He could have made it a lot of other ways.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.780]   He could have, but he didn't.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.980]   He designed it that way to demonstrate something about himself, and the more we study about
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.860]   those matters, and the more we realize how brilliant that is, that's just studying the
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   genius of God.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.980]   That's just studying the genius of God.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.980]   It's not just that.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.780]   It's not just his aesthetic aspect.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.460]   It's also his strength.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.240]   He lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.740]   The idea is that he keeps the sky from falling, so to speak, and ensuring that it just doesn't
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:55.940]   perpetually rain, things are contained, things are stable, and that's indicative of his strength.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.260]   When we understand how atmosphere works and all these different things, what we are magnifying
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:08.020]   is the genius of God and how he designed things strong and stable, and even his own power.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:14.420]   We are learning about the God we cannot see, speaking of which, continue on, he sets up
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.340]   the clouds to be his chariot.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.940]   Clouds move fast.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.300]   They're swift, and that's why they're God's chariot.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.740]   We learn about the swiftness of God, but we don't just learn about the swiftness of God.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   Here's another one.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.180]   He walks upon the wings of the wind.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.420]   We learn that though he is not visible, he is invisible.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.740]   That doesn't mean he's not present.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:47.420]   Do you remember what Jesus recalled in John chapter three, that the spirit, he moves as
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.960]   he wills, just like the wind.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.580]   You feel the wind, but you don't see it.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.920]   You feel the wind, but you cannot see where it came from.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.740]   In the same way, there is a supernatural realm.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.980]   You might not be able to see it, but you have every analogy to comprehend it, and God in
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:12.860]   creating all the meteorological properties that we see on day two, the sky and how it
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:20.060]   works, he is helping you to understand what you cannot see by virtue of what you can see.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.780]   That is the genius of God.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:28.220]   The more we study these kinds of things, the more we learn about that which we wouldn't
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:34.320]   know on our own per the revelation of the word of God.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:41.500]   By way of illustration, he makes his angels the winds, and his ministers flaming fire.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.800]   Angels in the supernatural realm can go quickly, and not only can they go quickly, but they
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.280]   are equally effective.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.140]   The notion of the word flaming here, referring to actually like lightning, it refers to that
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.380]   which can consume anything.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.140]   In Deuteronomy 32, a flaming fire can consume a mountain.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.680]   In Joel 119, it consumes trees.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.560]   In Psalm 97 verse 3, it consumes all of God's enemies.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.280]   This is a fire that cannot be quenched.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.920]   We know that, especially in Southern California, fire can have those kinds of properties.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.820]   Even lightning can have those properties.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:22.240]   Even when you study lightning and such from the sky, we can be impressed by the statistics.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:28.860]   Lightning in an average thunderstorm releases more energy than a plutonium bomb.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.640]   We think about that.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.840]   People are worried about nuclear wars.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:37.040]   There's a nuclear war every time there's a thunderstorm.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.840]   That is just an illustration where we study something, and it helps us to know the depth
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:48.440]   of God, to understand his careful design, and to realize this, that yes, you may not
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.160]   know that there ... You might not be able to see the supernatural realm, but it's there.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.880]   Wind is there, even though you can't see it, and even more, it's very effective.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.260]   It's so effective that it is that like lightning.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:09.520]   It is that like fire, all-consuming, and so God, in his design of days, in his design
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:20.080]   in six days, he ingeniously crafts every single property, every single aspect, every single
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.560]   characteristic to carry out not only his purpose, but to reveal things about himself.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.800]   He does that, and for those who have the scripture, they can behold the genius of God.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.640]   Well, there's day three, and day three, I wanted to get here because it demonstrates
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.120]   the breadth of God's purposes, the breadth of God's purposes.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.440]   This is found in verses five through 18.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   Day three, we know God created the land and the sea, speaking of which, that's why it
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.160]   opens in verse five with, "He founded the earth upon its place so that it will not shake
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.040]   forever and ever."
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:01.600]   God made dry land a certain way so that it would be that way, and in fact, you and I
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   presume that every single day of our lives.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.200]   We're presuming it right now.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.240]   Why?
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.000]   Because we're here.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.120]   We're sitting.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.560]   We're seated, and no one's just ready to jump because the land is about to collapse from
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.440]   under them.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.920]   The properties of the dirt, the properties of concrete, the properties of rocks and geology
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:31.360]   and such, we understand them, and the more we understand it, we realize the genius of
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.080]   God to do that, and there are other implications that we'll cover in a second.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.180]   But God didn't just create on the third day dry land.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.500]   He dealt with the sea.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.800]   He dealt with the waters.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   Look at verse six.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.080]   "You covered the land with the deep as with a garment," and at this point, with this word
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:54.760]   covered, we might be wondering, "Is this talking about the flood or is this talking about day
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   three?"
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   Good question.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   And the question continues.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.120]   The waters were standing above the mountains.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   In the flood, the flood waters came above the mountains.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   We know that.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.180]   End of Genesis chapter seven.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.760]   So is this talking about the flood or is it talking about day three?
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.040]   We understand that God had power even in the flood.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.120]   At your rebuke, they fled.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.160]   It's amazing to think about.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:25.960]   If you go to the ocean and you just yell at it, it doesn't do anything for you, but when
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:31.040]   God says one word, the waters move, and you say, "How do you know that?"
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.160]   Well, day three, evidently it happened.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.640]   The flood, evidently it happened, but how about when Jesus was on the Sea of Galilee?
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.480]   He just says, "Hush," and it's done.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.920]   The waters hushed.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.360]   That's how powerful God is.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.320]   That's the genius of God.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.160]   That's the properties by which He dealt with.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.040]   But at the sound of your thunder, they hurried away in alarm.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.800]   Only the waters can be commanded by God and seized by fear at who He is.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   The mountains went up.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   The valleys went down.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.520]   Again, is this talking about the flood or day three?
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.560]   Because yeah, in the flood, we can see some of these tectonics happening, and to the place
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.840]   where you found it for them, the water is properly allocated, and you set a boundary
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.040]   that they may not pass over so that they will not return to cover the earth.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.320]   Two observations here.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.640]   One is, and I'm always astounded by this, that God sets a boundary for water and it
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.680]   just doesn't cross.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.720]   We do that all the time, and it just doesn't work.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   You have a boundary.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.920]   It's called a pipe.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.180]   For some reason, the water just seems to cross it all the time.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.720]   You have a boundary called a levee, and then they just break.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.920]   But God says, "You shall not pass," and it never does.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.040]   It never does.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.220]   Absolutely profound.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.640]   So that they will not return to cover the earth, and here's the question once again.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.080]   Is this talking about day three or is it talking about the flood covering the earth?
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.200]   I thought that would be the flood.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.860]   Which one is this?
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.580]   And the answer is yes.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:14.580]   Which one is it?
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.600]   Day three or flood?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.680]   Yes.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.520]   Say why?
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   Because when God designed water on those days and formed it and formed the land in certain
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:32.760]   ways and gathered one to one place and the other to another place all on day three, He
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.000]   designed it so that the flood could happen.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Think about that.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:45.320]   This is why I tell my students, "You know, if God was like me," which we're thankful
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:53.260]   He's not, and He said, "Wouldn't it be hilarious to design the water like Jell-O?"
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.980]   You can't have a flood if the water is like Jell-O.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.980]   It won't be called a flood.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.260]   You know, it would just be called wobbly or something.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.460]   It won't work.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.060]   The reason the flood happens and the reason it's linked with day three is because God
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.120]   designed everything about water to have certain properties so that that would happen.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.100]   And the more you understand the properties of water and the more you understand the properties
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:24.100]   of land, the more you see and understand the genius of God in doing that specific formulation.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.100]   That's what you learn.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.460]   And you say, "Wow, well, that doesn't sound very nice though.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.460]   I mean, God just designed water to kill people.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.460]   Great."
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.340]   Hey, before you jump to that conclusion, look at verse 10.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:43.180]   The same water that was used to destroy the earth is the same water used to provide for
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180]   the earth.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   Isn't that profound?
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.580]   And it's the same properties of water.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   Notice this.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.220]   He sends forth springs in the valleys.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.860]   They flow between the mountains.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.220]   Why could the waters kill everybody?
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.020]   Because they flowed.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.300]   Why do the waters provide for everybody?
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.660]   Because they also, what, flow.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.580]   That's the genius of God.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.140]   That's the genius of God.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.380]   They give water to every beast of the field.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.660]   The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:19.820]   God designed water so profoundly, so brilliantly that it can both destroy and give life and
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.660]   all kinds of life and, in fact, all kinds of places of life.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.660]   Notice verse 12.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.580]   "Above them, the birds of the heaven dwell.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.420]   They give their voices among the branches."
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.020]   How do you get water all the way up there?
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   Simple.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   Verse 13.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.700]   He gives water to the mountains from his upper chambers.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:43.940]   Water has the unique property that it can evaporate and re-precipitate.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.300]   That is part of the genius of God.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.580]   You say, "Well, like, you know, water is a liquid."
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.580]   Yeah, but it also can be a gas, and it can also be a solid, and all of those things allow
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.980]   water to do what God intended it to be.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:04.620]   In one entity, in one object, God designs every single property, every single nuance
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:10.860]   of water, and in one moment, he says it, and it is, and all of these applications come
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   from it.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.420]   And so the earth is satisfied with the fruit of his works, verse 13.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   And verse 14, what also happens on day three is, because of the way water works and the
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.980]   way land works, now you can have grass grow, and grass grows for cattle and vegetation
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.900]   for man's cultivation to bring forth food from the earth.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.500]   Now you can have sustenance, and not just sustenance, verse 15, joy.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.860]   All of this is because of how God designed water, and how he designed everything to interact
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.620]   with that water so that man's heart can be made glad, and his face would glisten more
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.060]   than oil.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.380]   But here's something fascinating.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.660]   Not only what happens on day three are all the grass that grows, and all the plant life
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.260]   that grows, that can have so many applications from keeping you full in your tummy to giving
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.620]   you joy in your life.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.980]   It makes good for people who are just hungry, and people who are foodies.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.740]   Everything above, it is good for all of them.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.900]   That's the genius of God.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:11.020]   That's how he designed it all, in one instant, to have that many ramifications.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.620]   But notice this, and I love this, this is so profound, verse 16.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.480]   He didn't just design grass that day.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.220]   He designed trees.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.340]   He designed trees.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.220]   I'm bad at so many things.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.660]   I'm also, one of the additional things I'm bad at is construction.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:34.380]   Anything involving building stuff.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.780]   If you give me a plank of wood and say, "Cut it in half," you will have no plank of wood
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.900]   by the end of the day, because I'll just keep trying to cut it in half.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.060]   Well, that wasn't in half, but I'll try to cut it in half again, and I think that's even
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.060]   a math equation.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.560]   But here we are.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.260]   The trees of Yahweh are satisfied, and notice what it says here.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.260]   The cedars of Lebanon, which he planted.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.220]   Why does God make a mention of the cedars of Lebanon?
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.460]   The cedars of Lebanon are the trees that made the temple.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.620]   The trees that made the temple.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:10.660]   Do you realize, and here's what the psalmist is reminding us of, God didn't just say, "Trees,"
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.160]   and then a random plant ensues.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:23.340]   He made each tree with its certain properties intentionally on day three, including a tree
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:28.480]   that could be used for the construction of the temple.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.540]   He had that in mind.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.300]   Take it one step further.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   Day three, when he made a tree, he made a certain kind that could carry the weight of
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:47.580]   the body of his son, so that when he died on the cross, it would carry him.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.100]   All on day three.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.460]   God doesn't just create random things.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:02.580]   Everything is perfectly designed to carry out all of his purposes, and yes, people who
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:08.420]   work in engineering and STEM can appreciate the tensile strength, the density, all the
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.540]   different factors that go into finding good wood for construction, all that, but what
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.020]   you are discovering at that moment is the genius of God.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.840]   What you are discovering at that moment is the genius of God, because God designed it
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.980]   that way for those kinds of purposes.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.740]   He didn't have to make it that way, but he did, and he did for very specific purposes,
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.260]   all purposes, but even these purposes here, and that illustrates that nothing in this
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.140]   universe is random, and all of it is for him.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:40.020]   That's why this can not only support things of man's efforts and God's, of course, superintended
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.960]   efforts, but even the efforts, verse 17, that's where the birds build their nests and the
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.700]   storks' home is in the fir trees.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.620]   Not just the strength of a tree, but the height of a tree.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.780]   All of it designed by God.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.620]   All of it designed by God.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.980]   Every single aspect of it designed by God for his purposes, his genius, all of that
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.540]   there.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.500]   Verse 18 kind of closes out this section.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.360]   It says, "The high mountains are for the wild goats.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.820]   The cliffs are a refuge for the Shefanim."
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:14.220]   These are the different kinds of animals, the different kinds of creatures that live
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:20.940]   in the heights, and it's allusion all the way back to the fact that God made not only
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:26.240]   the waters on day three, but the dry land, and why did he make the dry land the way he
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240]   did?
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.180]   Simple, because it's a refuge.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:34.400]   It's even a refuge for those who are in the most remote places.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.180]   We live in homes, don't we?
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.200]   We walk on the planet, don't we?
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.780]   We do all these things assuming the ground is going to hold us up and that we're going
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.700]   to have provisions, and God made it that way.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:52.300]   So when you study anything from erosion to the composition of rocks in the mountains
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:59.660]   and everything, what you are studying is the genius way God made it so that it would do
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:05.100]   all that he wanted it to do, things that we presume all the time.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.180]   You know, if God had made the entire world out of sand, on the one hand, you know, every
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:17.840]   day would be a beach day, I guess, but every day you wouldn't be able to survive because
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.880]   you wouldn't have a home.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.900]   You wouldn't have any stability.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:30.780]   God made things a very certain way so that everything that can happen happens.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:35.500]   That's what we learn from day three, the breadth of all God's purposes.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:41.460]   It can even be for judgment or revival, all of it there.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.180]   What about day four?
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.580]   What about day four?
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.300]   Day four is the sun, moon, and stars, and we understand that, and it's not at that day
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.660]   to be clear that God made light.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.500]   He made light on day one.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:01.180]   Day four was the light bearers who organized all of this for all of light for the sake
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.100]   of time, and that's why in verse 19 it says this.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.540]   He made the moon for the seasons.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.380]   The sun knows the place of its setting.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.500]   That's the point, and so the psalmist read Genesis 1 very, very carefully.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.980]   He understood that it wasn't just that God created light on this day.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.980]   That's not what's going on at all.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:26.020]   It is that he created the light bearer to organize time, to organize time, and that
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.780]   matters.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.380]   Time matters for animals.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.540]   You appoint darkness so that it becomes night.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.620]   The beasts of the field, forests cry out.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.160]   The lions go after their prey.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.860]   They seek their food from God.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.820]   Verse 22, when the sun rises, they gather together, lie down into their dens, and man
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.220]   goes forth to his work and to his labor unto evening.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.800]   If you don't understand the value of time, realize this.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:58.580]   What would happen if predators and us all were awake at the same time?
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.380]   You wouldn't get anything done.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.500]   We wouldn't advance at all.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   Redemptive history, the rest of the biblical story would be, and then there was Adam, and
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:16.460]   Adam ran from a lion, the end, and then he had Cain, and Cain ran from the end, and Abel,
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.460]   the end.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.840]   I mean, that's all you would read about because you would just keep dying over and over and
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:28.180]   over and over again, but God ordained day and night and assigned animals and man different
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:34.620]   times so that we would be safe and that animals would operate a certain way and be provided
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.580]   for at the same time.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.900]   All of that's happening because of this.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.580]   Time is so profound.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.180]   Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:51.580]   Notice that time and the way that time is ordained by the sun, moon, and stars, even
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.340]   back then and now, shapes human industry.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   You say, "Really?
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.340]   Does time do that?"
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.340]   Think about this.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:04.740]   Think about how consumed we are with time, particularly in this land of America.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.740]   Think about school.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.740]   What do we have?
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.620]   Credit, hours.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.460]   Everything's measured by time.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.540]   If you don't think that that's enough, how about this?
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.900]   How do we describe food?
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.860]   You can go to fast food.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.780]   Why do we call it fast food?
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.780]   Because it's fast, hypothetically, which relates to what?
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   Time.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.620]   Why do we call a restaurant a restaurant?
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.300]   Because it takes a little bit more time so that you get a little bit of rest.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.860]   How about how we calculate the hours that you have to work?
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.140]   We calculate that by, inherently, time.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.500]   Holidays are calculated by time.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.580]   Retirement is calculated by time.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.340]   Everything is dictated by time.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.460]   And when did God ordain all that?
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:57.540]   He ordained it, of course, the very first day when He ordained evening and morning,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.540]   and there's time.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.500]   And He organized that time by the sun, moon, and stars.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.660]   Here's the profundity of God.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:11.500]   When you look at astronomy, and you look at meteorology, and you look at just even the
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:20.180]   science of time, God ordained all of that a certain way in one day to organize everybody's
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.980]   life.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.940]   He did it like that.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.500]   And yet, you know how often you feel the effects of that?
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.780]   Every single day.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.340]   Because every day has time.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.980]   Well, we've been through day one, two, three, and four.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.480]   We've seen the glory of God reflected, the invisible made visible.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.940]   We've seen God's multitude in His purposes on day three, and how He can just create water
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.380]   with its certain properties.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.780]   We've seen it in day four, that He can create just a few entities that control and dictate
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:56.180]   all of human experience, and the world's experience, that's the depth of it.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:02.520]   And on day five, here we are, verse 24 and following, verse 24 through 26, here is the
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.980]   punchline of it all.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.980]   The psalmist cannot contain himself anymore, and he says, "How numerous are your works,
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.300]   O Yahweh, in wisdom you have made them all."
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.340]   That's the absolute truth.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:20.500]   Have you seen that God, in these things, in everything He has created, He's created it
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.700]   with wisdom.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.100]   Nothing is random.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.500]   Nothing is by chance.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.060]   Nothing is purposeless.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.540]   Nothing is outside of design.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:34.060]   No, He's actually designed it for certain purposes, and we are just catching up to how
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.460]   brilliant that design is, how brilliant that blueprint is.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.820]   That's what science is.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:47.500]   In wisdom, you have made it all, and He, that is the psalmist, just contemplates day five,
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:53.020]   which is the sea creatures and the sky creatures that are created, and here's what he says.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.540]   There is the sea, great and broad.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:01.340]   I love going to the beach and just looking out into the ocean, because it is that vast.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.140]   It's just so massive.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:10.060]   It's so sweeping, and that magnifies God, because He alone designed it that way.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:14.680]   There are creeping things without number, creatures both small and great, and we know
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.740]   that about creatures.
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.980]   They're amazing to even understand the depths of the ocean.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:26.140]   If you want a justification for marine biology, here it is, right here, because God created
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.460]   that for us to investigate.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.660]   There the ships move along.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.180]   If you want nautical engineering, here you go.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:41.380]   The ships are there to explore it all, to enjoy it all, to engage in commerce, and here
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.100]   is what is profound.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:50.420]   There is the Leviathan, and the Leviathan is a dinosaur-like kind of creature, and it
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:57.460]   is the mascot of evil, a mascot of evil in the scriptures.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:03.900]   It had that reputation, but at that time, and there seemed to have been the Leviathans
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:11.220]   at the time of the psalmist, the psalmist comments that you formed to play in it.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:17.740]   Yes, you might have seen this fearsome, terrifying creature that you're scared of, but for God,
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.300]   He just made that thing to play in the water.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:27.340]   It's a big bath toy, and He just magnifies God.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.660]   That's the genius of God.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.260]   That's where you really understand something about God.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:40.620]   You think evil is so formidable and so insurmountable, and for God, it's just His toy.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:46.700]   It's just to play before Him, because it's not even a rival to Him whatsoever.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:53.660]   There are so many lessons to learn, so much to be impressed about, so much to be engaged
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:53:00.180]   in and to discover here, speaking of which, day six, day six, and now it gets personal
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.100]   and powerful.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.820]   What about man?
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.940]   What about animals?
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.060]   That's what was created on day six.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   Let me give you one word, maybe two, that help to describe some things here.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.540]   Here's the first word, dependence.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:22.900]   They all wait for you to give them their food in due season.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.340]   You give to them, they gather it up.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.300]   You open your hand, they are satisfied with good.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.660]   You hide their face, they are dismayed.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.660]   You take away their spirit, they breathe their last and return to the dust.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.980]   What does this show you?
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.420]   What is God demonstrating with His creatures?
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.260]   How dependent we are on Him.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:41.180]   Do you know one of the most major lessons I think that you can learn, we can learn in
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:47.540]   studying this world, this creation, is how much we are not in control.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.020]   How much we are not in control.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   I grew up in a family of scientists, and so sometimes I've asked my family, "Well, what
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.380]   would happen if this happened or that happened?
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.620]   And why doesn't this experiment prove this, that, or the other?
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.060]   And what is always the case?"
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:08.620]   Well, in an experiment, in that environment, it's a what kind of environment?
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.220]   Controlled.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.780]   Everything presumes that we have to have control to make things work.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:18.140]   And absolutely, that's the case, because you don't want some other situation or some other
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.180]   factor coming into play and messing up the equation.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.180]   We understand that.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:27.740]   But in the real world, there is no such thing in that way as the same controlled environment.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   Why?
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.660]   Because we don't have that control.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.660]   We don't have that control.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:37.420]   And that's what makes science applied hard, and we understand that.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.820]   And what do we learn here?
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.740]   God says, "That's part of the point."
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.660]   You start to realize, how do you know if this medicine's going to work?
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.660]   Well, that's why we don't say for certain, we just give a probability, don't we?
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.620]   How do we know that this treatment's going to work?
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.500]   How do we know that this procedure's going to work?
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.500]   How do we know?
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:03.620]   We never give it for sure, because there are things outside of our control.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.300]   When you look at human beings, and you look at people on this land, and animals on this
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:13.600]   land, we all wait for God.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.860]   Everything is God-willing.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.640]   Everything is dependent on Him.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.460]   And the more we study, and the more we know that we have to control things to produce
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:27.360]   scientific discoveries and outcomes and conclusions, the more we realize how much we don't control,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.600]   how much is outside of our control truly, how much we depend on God.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.440]   I think one of the greatest fallacies, sometimes people think, "Oh, I've got science.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:40.140]   I don't need God."
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.040]   What God reminds us here is if you really studied science hard, you would realize how
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:49.240]   much depends on Him, how much depends on Him.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.560]   Lots is not in your control.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.440]   If that was the case, you could run experiments not in a lab.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.040]   But there's a reason why we have to, because there's so much outside of our control.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.480]   We are so contingent on Him.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.800]   But here's something beautiful to think about, verse 30.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:16.440]   You send forth your spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:24.480]   On the one hand, this refers to both the birthing of animals and people.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.480]   That's true.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:31.440]   And on the one hand, this can even refer to the rejuvenation of plants and such.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.160]   That's true.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:39.600]   God sends forth the breath of life, and things are made, and things are renewed and come
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.840]   to fruition.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.460]   But on the other hand, this is crucial.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.000]   This is so crucial.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.440]   With the language of created and with the language of renewed, we can't just be talking
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.520]   about resuscitation.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.880]   We can't just be talking about a seed falls into the ground and grows up again.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.620]   That is included and obviously referred to, but the description is pointing to so much
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.000]   more than that, and here's the logic.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.360]   The logic is illustrated by our Lord in John chapter 12.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.040]   What does He say?
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.240]   But the seed must die in order to come back to life.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.160]   That's the illustration of the what?
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.800]   The resurrection.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:23.880]   And what we have here is the psalmist saying, "I know my God can raise people from the dead.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   I know He can make them new creatures and renew them in that way.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.440]   How do I know that He has that power?
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.180]   What gives me a taste of seeing that power?"
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.140]   He says, "I look in creation, and I see the God.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.820]   If He can cause birth, He can cause new birth.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:46.980]   If He can cause a seed to go in the ground that dies and comes back rejuvenated as a
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:52.280]   plant, then He can do that with me too and more."
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:58:00.860]   What are God revealed here is not, to be clear, that creation just inherently tells the gospel.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.300]   It's not general revelation as the same as special revelation at all, but rather this,
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:11.940]   that when you understand the truth of scripture and then you look at creation in it, you can
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:18.740]   see that the God who did one thing can do the other thing, that you can see the analogy,
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:23.540]   that you can see the correspondence, that you can see the illustration, that you can
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.300]   see the evidence.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.260]   You know what science should do?
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:32.860]   Science should give us the greatest confidence in the competence and the power of our God.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.660]   Because we know what He has designed.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.980]   We know what He has put together.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:44.700]   We know what He has constructed, and if He did all that by one word, and all of that
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:49.060]   is so genius and all of that had to work a certain way to get outcomes and it couldn't
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:54.540]   have worked any other way, then that God is able to save souls.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.300]   That God has the most amazing power ever.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:03.020]   Then we learn the worship of God, and that moves us from days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to day
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.260]   7.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:09.140]   Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.460]   What happens on day 7?
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.540]   God rests.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:15.780]   He enjoys all of His works, and all works are sanctified.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.780]   They're made holy unto Him, and that's why the text doesn't just say, "Let the glory
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:26.220]   of Yahweh endure forever," verse 31, "Let Yahweh be glad in His works."
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.300]   That's the whole point of all this.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.500]   Everything He made, He should have delight in.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:36.460]   Everything He made, we should remember that we are revering Him.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.780]   He looks at earth and it trembles, He touches the mountains and they smoke.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:46.940]   And here's the thing, for us personally, we don't just want God to be glad in us, but
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:52.580]   here's what we want to do to God, verse 33 and verse 34, so crucial.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.020]   "I will sing to Yahweh throughout my life.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.940]   I will sing praise to my God while I have my being."
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.980]   Why does the psalmist talk so much about singing?
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.580]   Some people don't like to sing.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.700]   They struggle with this verse.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.380]   What does it mean that I have to sing?
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.100]   I only can sing monotone.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.180]   Is that really counted as singing?
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:16.380]   You know, you don't have tonal variation, all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:27.340]   But everything that has breath, praise the Lord, singing is the usage of your breath.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.780]   The breath is what designates you as alive.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.500]   And what is the psalmist saying here then?
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:42.420]   I will use what uniquely shows that I am alive to honor my God.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:49.660]   It is the culmination of all that life is leveraged to the praise of God.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.660]   That's why he wants to sing.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.020]   He might not have been the greatest singer.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.380]   He might not have been Pavarotti.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380]   We don't know.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:04.500]   David, if it was David, he probably was, but what makes me alive should be there to give
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.060]   God glory.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.140]   That's why he sings.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.860]   That's what's going on there.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:16.340]   But it's not just what we do with our entire physicality and life.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340]   Verse 34.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.680]   And this is what's so appropriate for all of us here.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.920]   Let my musing be pleasing to him.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.260]   The psalmist, what has he just done?
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.500]   Mused on creation.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:37.440]   Days one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.660]   And what he has done is he has thought about all that God did in those days and all the
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.820]   ramifications that have come about and all the careful design that happened to accomplish
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.660]   very particular purposes.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.980]   It couldn't have happened any other way.
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:57.820]   And he is magnifying the genius of God in all of those designs.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.620]   This is the activity of everything in STEM.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.620]   It is my musing.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.980]   And what do we want it to be?
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.640]   Pleasing to him.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.800]   You might wonder, "Well, what in the world is going on in verse 35?
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.880]   Let sinners be consumed from the earth and let the wicked be no more.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.500]   Why would you end with that?"
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.740]   Simple.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.880]   Because this creation, God made for himself.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.060]   And what do we want it to be?
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.180]   The way he always made it.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.760]   And whether that be through judgment or whether that be through the gospel, we want it to
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.020]   be that way because that's the way it always was supposed to be.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:46.800]   And at that moment, and at that moment, our heart is really captured to what our God has
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   done.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   In fact, it's captured to the purpose of all of this because what's the purpose of flood
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.820]   and what's the purpose of cultivating and allowing man to exist and what's the purpose
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:01.560]   of allowing us to enjoy creation and what's the purpose of God sending forth even his
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.980]   spirit and so that there can be rejuvenation and everything?
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.140]   What is that all pointing to?
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:13.700]   What is that all providing demonstration and illustration of the reality that he redeems?
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.540]   That is all his goal in all of redemptive history is to do that.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.980]   And if we really understand what God did on those first six days, then we have to say
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.460]   with verse 35 what it says because that's the entire point.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.700]   This is our father's world.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.800]   It must in the end belong to him and that is our whole desire.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.820]   And so at the end, at the end, the psalmist having just thought about creation in these
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:41.740]   magnificent ways, he says, bless Yahweh, oh my soul, bless Yahweh.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.940]   You want to know why?
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.240]   He says it at the beginning.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.160]   He says it at the end because Yahweh is so amazing.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.320]   But even more, he is agreeing with what God did in Genesis 1.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   What did God do?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.280]   He blessed.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.940]   He blessed and he is affirming.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   That is exactly who God is and what he has done in this world.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:11.060]   Because only one so genius, only one so good, only one so kind and coordinated, and only
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:17.540]   one who has designed all of this for such a redemptive purpose, that one is blessed.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:22.900]   He blessed because that's true and we bless him to acknowledge that truth.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.340]   Bless Yahweh, oh my soul, praise Yah.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:31.980]   That's the cry of every scientist in the end, amen?
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.380]   Shall we pray?
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.460]   Our God and Father, thank you.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:45.780]   Thank you for this text which reminds us that all we are doing as those who investigate
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:53.260]   this creation is we are magnifying the works of God back on himself, that we are discovering
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:05:00.580]   the genius of God and exposing the genius of you in all the particulars and all the
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:07.140]   specifics that you have done to achieve every single purpose, every single end result.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.740]   We are magnifying and amplifying all of that back to you.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:21.180]   And so these endeavors, they are inherently noble and they are inherently worshipped because
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:28.140]   of what they do in the discovery of all the glory therein that you have magnified in six
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.260]   days.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.980]   Remind us of these things, oh God.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.300]   Help us to marvel at these things.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:44.940]   It may be every discovery we make, every find that we have, we say bless Yahweh, oh my soul.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:51.820]   Bless Yahweh because we are proving that indeed you are so blessed.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.220]   In your name we pray, amen.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:55.720]   Amen.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.220]   Amen.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:56.720]   Amen.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.220]   Amen.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:57.720]   Amen.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.220]   Amen.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:58.720]   Amen.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.220]   Amen.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:05:59.720]   Amen.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
