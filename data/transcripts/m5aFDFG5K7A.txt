[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   Today, I'm going to show you how to get started with weights and biases using Keras in less
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.440]   than a minute.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.600]   My name is Chris Van Pelt, co-founder of WNB.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.160]   Let's get going.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.540]   First, install WNB.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.280]   It's one line of code.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   Now let's import our Python client, WANDB, and the WNB Keras callback.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920]   Now we're good to go.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.500]   We'll initialize a new weights and biases run and a config variable which will let us
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000]   keep track of our hyperparameters.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.920]   Now we're all set to jump into training.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   All we have to do to integrate with Keras is add the WNB callback to the model.fit function.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.080]   We also pass our hyperparameters so we can reproduce this epic training run.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   That's it.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.600]   Seriously.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.480]   Now you can see the metrics flowing into your interactive dashboard and your hyperparameters
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.040]   in the runs table.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.720]   You can also compare different training runs in terms of accuracy on the project dashboard.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.040]   For the best experience, you should sign up for an account at wnb.me/signup.
