[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   The following is a conversation with Leonard Susskind.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.840]   He's a professor of theoretical physics
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.640]   at Stanford University and founding director
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.440]   of Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.040]   He is widely regarded as one of the fathers
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.920]   of string theory and in general,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.400]   as one of the greatest physicists of our time,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   both as a researcher and an educator.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.120]   Perhaps you noticed that the people I've been speaking with
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.880]   are not just computer scientists,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.240]   but philosophers, mathematicians, writers, psychologists,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   physicists, and soon other disciplines.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.360]   To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.960]   bigger than computing.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.840]   It is our civilization's journey
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   into understanding the human mind
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   and creating echoes of it in the machine.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.760]   If you enjoy the podcast, subscribe on YouTube,

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.560]   at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.640]   And now, here's my conversation with Leonard Susskind.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.160]   How has he influenced you,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.120]   changed you as a physicist and thinker?
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.880]   - What I saw, I think what I saw was somebody
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.560]   who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.080]   His style was almost to close his eyes
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520]   and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.840]   and through visualization,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.080]   outflank the mathematical, the highly mathematical
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.480]   and very, very sophisticated technical arguments
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.040]   that people would use.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.400]   I think that was also natural to me,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.960]   but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.760]   who could do physics in a way that I regarded
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   as simpler, more direct,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.800]   more intuitive, and while I don't think
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.040]   he changed my way of thinking,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.480]   I do think he validated it.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.640]   He made me look at it and say,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.280]   "Yeah, that's something you can do and get away with."
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   Practically, you can get away with it.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.240]   - So, do you find yourself,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.160]   whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920]   or black holes or string theory,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.400]   using intuition as a first step
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.160]   or a step throughout using visualization?
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   - Yeah, very much so, very much so.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   I tend not to think about the equations.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.180]   I tend not to think about the symbols.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.660]   I tend to try to visualize the phenomena themselves.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.400]   And then when I get an insight that I think is valid,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   I might try to convert it to mathematics,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.400]   but I'm not a natural mathematician.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280]   I'm good enough at it.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.820]   I'm good enough at it, but I'm not a great mathematician.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.480]   So for me, the way of thinking about physics
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.700]   is first intuitive, first visualization,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.720]   scribble a few equations maybe,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.020]   but then try to convert it to mathematics.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.840]   Experience is that other people are better
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.940]   at converting it to mathematics than I am.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.520]   - And yet, you've worked with very counterintuitive ideas.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.880]   So how do you-- - No, that's true.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.120]   That's true. - So how do you visualize
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.640]   something counterintuitive?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.480]   How do you dare?
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.960]   - By rewiring your brain in new ways.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.720]   Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.760]   Very little of modern physics is intuitive.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.500]   Intuitive, what does intuitive mean?
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.820]   It means the ability to think about it
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.740]   with basic classical physics,
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.740]   the physics that we evolved with,
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.100]   throwing stones, splashing water,
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.400]   whatever it happens to be.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.100]   Quantum physics, general relativity,
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.180]   quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.220]   But after time and getting familiar with these things,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.080]   you develop new intuitions.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.560]   I always said you rewire.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.400]   And it's to the point where me and many of my friends,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.740]   I and many of my friends,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.260]   can think more easily quantum mechanically
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.520]   than we can classically.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   We've gotten so used to it.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.240]   - I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.420]   is such that we understand rocks and stones and water
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.040]   and so on. - We sort of evolved for that.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.320]   - Evolved for it. - Yeah.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.740]   - Do you think it's possible to create a wiring
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.160]   of neuron-like state devices that more naturally
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.880]   understand quantum mechanics, understand wave function,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.100]   understand these weird things?
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.040]   - Well, I'm not sure.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480]   I think many of us have evolved the ability
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.360]   to think quantum mechanically to some extent,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.960]   but that doesn't mean you can think like an electron.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.600]   That doesn't mean, another example,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   forget for a minute quantum mechanics,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.660]   just visualizing four-dimensional space
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.080]   or five-dimensional space or six-dimensional space,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.780]   I think we're fundamentally wired
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.240]   to visualize three dimensions.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.960]   I can't even visualize two dimensions or one dimension
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   without thinking about it as embedded in three dimensions.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.280]   If I want to visualize a line,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.840]   I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.580]   Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.160]   with a piece of paper being in three dimensions.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   I never seem to be able to, in some abstract and pure way,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.720]   visualize in my head the one dimension, the two dimension,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.800]   the four dimension, the five dimensions,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.360]   and I don't think that's ever gonna happen.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   The reason is, I think,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.880]   our neural wiring is just set up for that.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.000]   On the other hand, we do learn ways
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.560]   to think about five, six, seven dimensions.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.160]   We learn ways, we learn mathematical ways,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.600]   and we learn ways to visualize them, but they're different.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.760]   And so, yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.200]   Whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.900]   to be completely comfortable with these concepts, I doubt.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.500]   - So that it's completely natural.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.060]   - To a degree, it's completely natural.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.140]   - So I'm sure there's somewhat, you could argue,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.380]   creatures that live in a two-dimensional space.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.580]   - Yeah, maybe there are.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.220]   - And while it's romanticizing the notion,
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.020]   of course, we're all living, as far as we know,
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.660]   in three-dimensional space,
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.580]   but how do those creatures imagine 3D space?
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.580]   - Well, probably the way we imagine 4D,
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.440]   by using some mathematics and some equations
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.020]   and some tricks.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.320]   - Okay, so jumping back to Feynman just for a second,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.740]   he had a little bit of an ego.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.780]   - Yes.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.120]   - Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.860]   - I think both, both, both.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.500]   I think you have to have both arrogance and humility.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.560]   You have to have the arrogance to say, "I can do this.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   "Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.060]   "I'm smart enough, I can do it.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.000]   "I can win the battle with nature."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   On the other hand, I think you also have to have
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   the humility to know that you're very likely
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.040]   to be wrong on any given occasion.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.500]   Young people can come along and say things
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.920]   you won't understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.600]   So I think it's a combination of both.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.720]   You better recognize that you're very limited
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.200]   and you better be able to say to yourself,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.220]   "I'm not so limited that I can't win
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.560]   "this battle with nature."
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.160]   It takes a special kind of person who can manage
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.840]   both of those, I would say.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.040]   - And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work,
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.360]   a little bit of ego, a little bit of outside
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.840]   of the box, humble thinking.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.580]   - I hope so.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.580]   - So was there a time where you felt,
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.020]   you looked at yourself and asked,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.920]   "Am I completely wrong about this?"
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.980]   - Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things?
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.020]   - The whole thing.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.060]   Wait, which whole thing?
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.980]   - Me and me and my ability to do this thing.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.420]   - Oh, those kinds of doubts.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.860]   First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.940]   - No, I had different kind of doubts.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.900]   I came from a very working class background
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.660]   and I was uncomfortable in academia for a long time.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.260]   But they weren't doubts about my ability or my,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:52.700]   they were just the discomfort in being in an environment
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.600]   that my family hadn't participated in,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.300]   I knew nothing about as a young person.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.700]   I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.340]   until I was almost 20 years old.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.180]   - Yeah.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.580]   - So I did have certain kind of doubts,
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.860]   but not about my ability.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.000]   I don't think I was too worried
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.900]   about whether I would succeed or not.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.840]   I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.740]   That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.860]   - Maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.720]   of what is academia?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.100]   Because I too feel a bit uncomfortable in it.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.020]   There's something I can't put quite into words
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.020]   what you have that's not, doesn't, if we call it music,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.500]   you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.940]   How have you joined this orchestra?
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.500]   How do you think about it?
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.100]   - I don't know that I thought about it
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.220]   as much as I just felt it.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.800]   Thinking is one thing, feeling is another thing.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.100]   I felt like an outsider until a certain age
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.740]   when I suddenly found myself the ultimate insider
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.080]   in academic physics.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   That was a sharp transition.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.300]   I wasn't a young man, I was probably 50 years old.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.960]   - So you were never quite, it was a phase transition,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.360]   you were never quite in the middle.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.480]   - Yeah, that's right, I wasn't.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.120]   I always felt a little bit of an outsider.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.300]   In the beginning, a lot an outsider.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.480]   My way of thinking was different.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.080]   My approach to mathematics was different.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.200]   But also, my social background
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   that I came from was different.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.540]   Now these days, half the young people I meet,
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.080]   their parents were professors.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   That was not my case.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   So, yeah, but then all of a sudden,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.240]   at some point, I found myself at very much the center of,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.840]   maybe not the only one at the center,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   but certainly one of the people in the center
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.340]   of a certain kind of physics.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.100]   And all that went away, I mean, it went away in a flash.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.760]   - So, maybe a little bit with Feynman,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.500]   but in general, how do you develop ideas?
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.100]   Do you work through ideas alone?
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.820]   Do you brainstorm with others?
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.380]   - Oh, both, both, very definitely both.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.560]   The younger time, I spent more time with myself.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.480]   Now, because I'm at Stanford,
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   because I have a lot of ex-students,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.360]   and people who are interested in the same thing I am,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.360]   I spend a good deal of time, almost on a daily basis,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.580]   interacting, brainstorming, as you said.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.360]   It's a very important part.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.820]   I spend less time, probably, completely self-focused
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.780]   and with a piece of paper
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.640]   and just sitting there staring at it.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.820]   - What are your hopes for quantum computers?
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.740]   So, machines that are based on,
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.140]   that have some elements of leveraged quantum
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.020]   mechanical ideas.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.300]   - It's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   You can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.660]   Simulate them means solve the Schrodinger equation for them,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.240]   or solve the equations of quantum mechanics
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.660]   on a computer, on a classical computer.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.440]   But the classical computer is not doing,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.820]   is not a quantum mechanical system itself.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.160]   Of course it is, everything's made of quantum mechanics,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.340]   but it's not functioning.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.140]   It's not functioning as a quantum system.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.600]   It's just solving equations.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.860]   The quantum computer is truly a quantum system,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.180]   which is actually doing the things
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.400]   that you're programming it to do.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   You want to program a quantum field theory?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.700]   If you do it in classical physics,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.740]   that program is not actually functioning
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.800]   in the computer as a quantum field theory.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.500]   It's just solving some equations.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.760]   Physically, it's not doing the things
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.280]   that the quantum system would do.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.420]   The quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system,
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.140]   which is actually carrying out the quantum operations.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.360]   You can measure it at the end.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.520]   It intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.340]   It is limited in the same way that quantum systems
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.460]   are limited by uncertainty and so forth.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.260]   And it really is a quantum system.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.420]   That means that what you're doing
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.380]   when you program something for a quantum system
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.940]   is you're actually building a real version of the system.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.460]   The limits of a classical computer,
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.940]   classical computers are enormously limited
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.180]   when it comes to quantum systems.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.060]   They're enormously limited
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.280]   because you've probably heard this before,
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.980]   but in order to store the amount of information
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.940]   that's in a quantum state of 400 spins,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.980]   that's not very many,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.900]   400 I can put in my pocket,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.600]   400 pennies in my pocket.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.220]   To be able to simulate the quantum state
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.900]   of 400 elementary quantum systems,
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.660]   qubits we call them,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.900]   to do that would take more information
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.160]   than can possibly be stored in the entire universe
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.860]   if it were packed so tightly
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.420]   that you couldn't pack any more in.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.260]   400 qubits.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.380]   On the other hand,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.360]   if your quantum computer is composed of 400 qubits,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.640]   it can do everything 400 qubits can do.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.780]   - What kind of space,
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.380]   if you just intuitively think about the space of algorithms
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.360]   that that unlocks for us.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.520]   So there's a whole complexity theory
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.100]   around classical computers
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.460]   measuring the running time of things,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.780]   and P, so on.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.640]   What kind of algorithms, just intuitively,
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.400]   do you think it unlocks for us?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.120]   - Okay, so we know that there are a handful of algorithms
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.820]   that can seriously beat classical computers
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.220]   and which can have exponentially more power.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.460]   This is a mathematical statement.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.340]   Nobody's exhibited this in the laboratory.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.580]   It's a mathematical statement.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.460]   We know that's true,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.660]   but it also seems more and more
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.380]   that the number of such things is very limited.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.100]   Only very, very special problems
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.780]   exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.140]   of standard problems.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.940]   To my mind, as far as I can tell,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.620]   the great power of quantum computers
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.720]   will actually be to simulate quantum systems.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.800]   If you're interested in a certain quantum system
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.900]   and it's too hard to simulate classically,
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.860]   you simply build a version of the same system.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.140]   You build a version of it,
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.060]   you build a model of it
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.480]   that's actually functioning as the system,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.900]   you run it, and then you do the same thing
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.540]   you would do to the quantum system,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.460]   you make measurements on it,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.860]   quantum measurements on it.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.180]   The advantages, you can run it much slower.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.540]   You could say, why bother?
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.620]   Why not just use the real system?
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.380]   Why not just do experiments on the real system?
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.940]   Well, real systems are kind of limited.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.340]   You can't change them, you can't manipulate them,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.440]   you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.460]   You can't modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.280]   to see what would happen
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.780]   if I change the system a little bit.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.100]   I think that quantum computers
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.580]   will be extremely valuable
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.980]   in understanding quantum systems.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.340]   - At the lowest level of the fundamental laws.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.540]   - They're actually satisfying the same laws
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.180]   as the systems that they're simulating.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.020]   - That's right.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.060]   - Okay, so on the one hand, you have things like factoring.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.580]   Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers,
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.740]   factoring large numbers.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.620]   That doesn't seem that much to do with quantum mechanics.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.220]   It seems to be almost a fluke
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:30.120]   that a quantum computer can solve
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.920]   the factoring problem in a short time.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.520]   And those problems seem to be extremely special, rare,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.300]   and it's not clear to me
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.740]   that there's gonna be a lot of them.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.180]   On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.900]   Chemistry, there's solid state physics,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.020]   there's material science, there's quantum gravity,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.640]   there's all kinds of quantum field theory.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.780]   And some of these are actually turning out
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.100]   to be applied sciences
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.140]   as well as very fundamental sciences.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.140]   So we probably will run out of the ability
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.820]   to solve equations for these things.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.940]   You know, solve equations by the standard methods
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.620]   of pencil and paper,
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.440]   solve the equations by the method of classical computers.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.760]   And so what we'll do is we'll build versions
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.100]   of these systems, run them,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.260]   and run them under controlled circumstances
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.840]   where we can change them, manipulate them,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.100]   make measurements on them,
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.540]   and find out all the things we wanna know.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.660]   - So in finding out the things we wanna know
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.700]   about very small systems, right,
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.260]   is there something we can also find out
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.100]   about the macro level?
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.380]   About something about the function,
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.100]   forgive me, of our brain, biological systems?
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.380]   The stuff that's about one meter in size
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.440]   versus much, much smaller.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.220]   - Well, all the excitement is about,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.880]   among the people that I interact with,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.920]   is understanding black holes.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   - Black holes.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.020]   - Black holes are big things.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.120]   They are many, many degrees of freedom.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.720]   There is another kind of quantum system that is big.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.860]   It's a large quantum computer.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.160]   And one of the things we've learned
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.720]   is that the physics of large quantum computers
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.580]   is in some ways similar to the physics
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.760]   of large quantum black holes.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.000]   And we're using that relationship.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.760]   Now you asked, you didn't ask about quantum computers
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.120]   or systems, you didn't ask about black holes,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.000]   you asked about brains.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.320]   - Yeah, about stuff that's in the middle of the two.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.280]   - It's different.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.640]   - So black holes are, there's something fundamental
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.280]   about black holes that feels to be very different
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.240]   than brains.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.400]   - Yes, and they also function
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.000]   in a very quantum mechanical way.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.840]   - Right.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.660]   - Okay, it is, first of all, unclear to me,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.160]   but of course it's unclear to me.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.500]   I'm not a neuroscientist.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.120]   I have, I don't even have very many friends
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.240]   who are neuroscientists.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.640]   I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.540]   I just don't run into them very often.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.440]   Among the few neuroscientists I've ever talked about
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   about this, they are pretty convinced
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.760]   that the brain functions classically.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.640]   That it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.680]   or doesn't make use of the special features,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.480]   entanglement, coherent superposition.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.440]   Are they right?
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   I sort of hope they're wrong,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.960]   just because I like the romantic idea
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.240]   that the brain is a quantum system.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.720]   But I think probably not.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.640]   The other thing, big systems can be composed
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.040]   of lots of little systems.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.720]   Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.120]   but they're made out of quantum systems.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.180]   Now, one of the things that's been happening
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.600]   over the last good number of years
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.720]   is we're discovering materials and quantum systems
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.200]   which function much more quantum mechanically
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.640]   than we imagine.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.040]   Topological insulators, this kind of thing,
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.520]   that kind of thing.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.220]   Those are macroscopic systems,
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.120]   but they're just superconductors.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.900]   Superconductors have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.040]   You can have a large chunk of superconductor,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.800]   so it's a big piece of material.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.640]   On the other hand, it's functioning and its properties
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.840]   depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.220]   And to analyze them, you need the tools of quantum mechanics.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.620]   - If we can go on to black holes,
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.780]   and looking at the universe as a information processing
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.760]   system, as a computer, as a giant computer.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.600]   - It's a giant computer.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   - What's the power of thinking of the universe
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.360]   as an information processing system?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.200]   Or what is, perhaps its use,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.840]   and your famous debates and ideas around that,
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.040]   to human beings, or life in general
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.840]   as information processing systems?
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.560]   - Well, all systems are information processing systems.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.360]   You poke them, they change a little bit,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.800]   they evolve.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.400]   All systems are information processing systems.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.460]   - So there's no extra magic to us humans?
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.080]   It certainly feels, consciousness and intelligence
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   feels like magic.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.920]   - It sure does.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.240]   - Where does it emerge from?
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.780]   If we look at information processing,
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.560]   what are the emerging phenomena that come from
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.920]   viewing the world as an information processing system?
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.000]   - Here is what I think.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.560]   My thoughts are not worth much in this.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.660]   If you ask me about physics,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.680]   my thoughts may be worth something.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.080]   If you ask me about this,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.920]   I'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.320]   But, as I said earlier,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.800]   I think when we do introspection,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.560]   when we imagine doing introspection
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.520]   and try to figure out what it is when we do,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.520]   when we're thinking, I think we get it wrong.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.880]   I'm pretty sure we get it wrong.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.280]   Everything I've heard about the way the brain functions
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.880]   is so counterintuitive.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.400]   For example, you have neurons which detect vertical lines.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.920]   You have different neurons which detect lines at 45 degrees.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.480]   You have different neurons.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.840]   I never imagined that there were whole circuits
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.400]   which were devoted to vertical lines in the brain.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.140]   It doesn't seem to be the way my brain works.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.160]   My brain seems to work if I put my finger up vertically,
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.240]   or if I put it horizontally,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.420]   or if I put it this way or that way.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.240]   It seems to me it's the same circuits that are,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.740]   it's not the way it works.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.520]   The way the brain is compartmentalized
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.720]   seems to be very, very different
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.600]   than what I would have imagined
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.680]   if I were just doing psychological introspection
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.880]   about how things work.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.560]   My conclusion is that we won't get it right that way.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.820]   How will we get it right?
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.720]   I think maybe computer scientists will get it right.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.480]   Eventually, I don't think there are anywheres near it.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.720]   I don't even think they're thinking about it.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.840]   But by computer, eventually we will build machines,
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.480]   perhaps, which are complicated enough,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.380]   and partly engineered, partly evolved,
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.080]   maybe evolved by machine learning and so forth.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.520]   This machine learning is very interesting.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.040]   By machine learning, we will evolve systems,
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.440]   and we may start to discover mechanisms
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:35.360]   that have implications for how we think
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.660]   and for what this consciousness thing is all about.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.040]   And we'll be able to do experiments on them
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.720]   and perhaps answer questions
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.640]   that we can't possibly answer by introspection.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.720]   - So that's a really interesting point.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.240]   In many cases, if you look at even a string theory,
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.760]   when you first think about a system,
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.600]   it seems really complicated, like the human brain.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.480]   And through some basic reasoning
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.400]   and trying to discover fundamental,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.520]   low-level behavior of the system,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.160]   you find out that it's actually much simpler.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.560]   Do you, one, have you, is that generally the process?
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   And two, do you have that also hope
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.920]   for biological systems as well,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.600]   for all the kinds of stuff we're studying
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.720]   at the human level?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.480]   - Of course, physics always begins by trying
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.560]   to find the simplest version of something and analyze it.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.400]   Yeah, I mean, there are lots of examples
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.360]   where physics has taken very complicated systems,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.000]   analyzed them, and found simplicity in them, for sure.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.880]   I said superconductors before.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.840]   It's an obvious one.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.480]   A superconductor seems like a monstrously complicated thing
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   with all sorts of crazy electrical properties,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.360]   magnetic properties, and so forth.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.440]   And when it finally is boiled down
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.920]   to its simplest elements,
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.080]   it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.280]   called spontaneous symmetry breaking,
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.760]   which we, in other contexts, we learned about
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.720]   and we're very familiar with.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.480]   So yeah, I mean, yes, we do take complicated things,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.680]   make them simple, but what we don't wanna do
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.520]   is take things which are intrinsically complicated
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.400]   and fool ourselves into thinking
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.600]   that we can make them simple.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.360]   We don't wanna make, I don't know who said this,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.640]   but we don't wanna make them simpler
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.720]   than they really are, okay?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.800]   Is the brain a thing which ultimately functions
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.560]   by some simple rules, or is it just complicated?
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.760]   In terms of artificial intelligence,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.840]   nobody really knows what are the limits
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.720]   of our current approaches.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.000]   You mentioned machine learning.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.840]   How do we create human-level intelligence?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.240]   It seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   who perhaps oversimplify the nature of intelligence
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.800]   and think of it as information processing,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.200]   and therefore there doesn't seem to be
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.080]   any theoretical reason why we can't artificially create
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.000]   human-level or superhuman-level intelligence.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.560]   In fact, the reasoning goes,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.320]   if you create human-level intelligence,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.640]   the same approach you just used
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.440]   to create human-level intelligence
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.760]   should allow you to create superhuman-level intelligence
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.000]   very easily, exponentially.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.960]   So what do you think that way of thinking
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.240]   that comes from physicists is all about?
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   - I wish I knew, but there's a particular reason
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   why I wish I knew.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.360]   I have a second job.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.500]   I consult for Google.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.840]   Not for Google, for Google X.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.880]   I am the senior academic advisor
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.100]   to a group of machine learning physicists.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.760]   Now, that sounds crazy
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.800]   because I know nothing about the subject.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.000]   I know very little about the subject.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.240]   On the other hand, I'm good at giving advice,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   so I give them advice on things.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.280]   Anyway, I see these young physicists
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.660]   who are approaching the machine learning problem.
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.880]   There is a real machine learning problem,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.080]   namely, why does it work as well as it does?
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.320]   Nobody really seems to understand
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.480]   why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.640]   that it does and so forth.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.000]   And there are three groups of people
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.480]   who have thought about this.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.080]   There are the engineers.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.580]   The engineers are incredibly smart,
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.800]   but they tend not to think as hard
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.080]   about why the thing is working
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.240]   as much as they do how to use it.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.800]   Obviously, they've provided a lot of data.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.040]   And it is they who demonstrated
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.820]   that machine learning can work much better
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.400]   than you had any right to expect.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.160]   The machine learning systems are systems,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.960]   the systems not too different
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.900]   than the kind of systems that physicists study.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.740]   There's not all that much difference
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.320]   between quantum, in the structure of the mathematics,
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.480]   physically, yes, but in the structure of the mathematics,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.680]   between a tensor network designed
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.420]   to describe a quantum system on the one hand,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.120]   and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.040]   So, more and more, I think, young physicists
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.800]   are being drawn to this field of machine learning,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.120]   some very, very good ones.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   I work with a number of very good ones,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   not on machine learning, but on having lunch.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.320]   - On having lunch?
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.440]   - Right. (laughs)
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.840]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.600]   - And I can tell you, they are super smart.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.560]   They don't seem to be so arrogant
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.040]   about their physics backgrounds
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.080]   that they think they can do things that nobody else can do.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.480]   But the physics way of thinking, I think,
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.880]   will add great value to,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.960]   will bring value to the machine learning.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.760]   I believe it will.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   And I think it already has.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.040]   - At what time scale do you think predicting
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.180]   the future becomes useless?
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.520]   In your long experience in being surprised
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.660]   at new discoveries.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:03.440]   - Sometimes a day, sometimes 20 years.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.560]   There are things which I thought
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.800]   we were very far from understanding,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.380]   which practically in a snap of the fingers
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.380]   or a blink of the eye suddenly became understood,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.040]   completely surprising to me.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.960]   There are other things which I looked at
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.560]   and I said, "We're not gonna understand these things
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.240]   "for 500 years, in particular quantum gravity."
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.840]   The scale for that was 20 years, 25 years.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.760]   And we understand a lot,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.880]   and we don't understand it completely now by any means,
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.740]   but I thought it was 500 years to make any progress.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.920]   It turned out to be very, very far from that.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.160]   It turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.340]   from the time when I thought it was 500 years.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.900]   - So if we may, can we jump around quantum gravity,
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.640]   some basic ideas in physics?
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.300]   What is the dream of string theory, mathematically?
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.140]   What is the hope?
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.440]   Where does it come from?
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.560]   What problem is it trying to solve?
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.000]   - I don't think the dream of string theory
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.540]   is any different than the dream
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.560]   of fundamental theoretical physics altogether.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.680]   - Understanding a unified theory of everything.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.040]   - I don't like thinking of string theory
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.320]   as a subject unto itself,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.440]   with people called string theorists
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.240]   who are the practitioners of this thing
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.120]   called string theory.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.180]   I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.080]   trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.400]   in particular gravity,
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.040]   in particular gravity and its connection
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.320]   with quantum mechanics,
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.080]   and who at the present time
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.540]   find string theory a useful tool,
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.440]   rather than saying there's this subject
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.440]   called string theorists.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.680]   I don't like being referred to as a string theorist.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.880]   - Yes, but as a tool,
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.120]   is it useful to think about our nature
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.520]   in multiple dimensions, the strings vibrating?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.080]   - I believe it is useful.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.160]   I'll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.960]   Well, it has had a number of main uses.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.400]   Originally, string theory was invented,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.560]   and I know that I was there,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.320]   I was right at the spot where it was being invented,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.280]   literally, and it was being invented
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.000]   to understand hadrons.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.160]   Hadrons are subnuclear particles,
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.960]   protons, neutrons, mesons,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:27.000]   and at that time, the late '60s, early '70s,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.160]   it was clear from experiment
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.720]   that these particles called hadrons could vibrate,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.840]   could rotate, could do all the things
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.680]   that a little closed string can do,
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   and it was and is a valid and correct theory
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.880]   of these hadrons.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.120]   It's been experimentally tested,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.440]   and that is a done deal.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.200]   It had a second life as a theory of gravity,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.060]   the same basic mathematics,
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.280]   except on a very, very much smaller distance scale.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.300]   The objects of gravitation are 19 orders of magnitude
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.080]   smaller than a proton,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.000]   but the same mathematics turned up.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.300]   The same mathematics turned up.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.980]   What has been its value?
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.760]   Its value is that it's mathematically rigorous in many ways
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   and enabled us to find mathematical structures
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.080]   which have both quantum mechanics and gravity with rigor.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.060]   We can test out ideas.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.140]   We can test out ideas.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.220]   We can't test them in the laboratory,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.840]   that they're 19 orders of magnitude too small,
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.280]   the things that we're interested in,
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.200]   but we can test them out mathematically
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.840]   and analyze their internal consistency.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:52.780]   By now, 40 years ago, 35 years ago, and so forth,
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:57.100]   people very, very much questioned the consistency
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.240]   between gravity and quantum mechanics.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.840]   Stephen Hawking was very famous for it, rightly so.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:09.080]   Now, nobody questions that consistency anymore.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.440]   They don't because we have mathematically precise
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.920]   string theories which contain both gravity
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.940]   and quantum mechanics in a consistent way.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.640]   So it's provided that certainty
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.060]   that quantum mechanics and gravity can coexist.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.440]   That's not a small thing.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.360]   It's a very big thing. - It's a huge thing.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.200]   - It's a huge thing.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.440]   - Einstein would be proud.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.060]   - Einstein, he might be appalled.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.900]   I don't know.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.520]   He didn't like quantum mechanics very much,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.520]   but he would certainly be struck by it.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.040]   I think that may be, at this time,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.200]   its biggest contribution to physics in illustrating,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.760]   almost definitively, that quantum mechanics and gravity
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.600]   are very closely related
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.940]   and not inconsistent with each other.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.800]   - Is there a possibility of something deeper,
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   more profound, that still is consistent with string theory,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.080]   but is deeper, that is to be found?
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.880]   - Well, you could ask the same thing about quantum mechanics.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.720]   Is there something-- - Exactly.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.040]   I think string theory is just an example
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.000]   of a quantum mechanical system
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.660]   that contains both gravitation and quantum mechanics.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:19.760]   So is there something underlying quantum mechanics?
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.560]   - Perhaps something deterministic.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.920]   - Perhaps something deterministic.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.360]   My friend, Gerard Etoft, whose name you may know,
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.400]   he's a very famous physicist, Dutch,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.200]   not as famous as he should be, but--
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.160]   - Hard to spell his name.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.280]   - It's hard to say his name.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.480]   No, it's easy to spell his name.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.280]   An apostrophe, he's the only person I know
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.120]   whose name begins with an apostrophe.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.320]   And he's one of my heroes in physics.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.200]   He's a little younger than me,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.640]   but he's nevertheless one of my heroes.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   Etoft believes that there is some substructure
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:58.880]   to the world which is classical in character,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.120]   deterministic in character,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.600]   which somehow, by some mechanism
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.920]   that he has a hard time spelling out,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.020]   emerges as quantum mechanics.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.520]   I don't.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.800]   - The wave function is somehow emergent.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.200]   - The wave function, not just the wave function,
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.720]   but the whole mechan, the whole thing
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.960]   that goes with quantum mechanics,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.000]   uncertainty, entanglement, all these things are emergent.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.960]   - So you think quantum mechanics is the bottom of the well?
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:33.160]   - Here I think is where you have to be humble.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.440]   Here's where humility comes.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.720]   I don't think anybody should say
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.820]   anything is the bottom of the well at this time.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.300]   I think we can reasonably say,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.240]   I can reasonably say when I look into the well,
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.500]   I can't see past quantum mechanics.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.840]   I don't see any reason for there to be anything
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.080]   beyond quantum mechanics.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.240]   I think Etoft has asked very interesting
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.840]   and deep questions I don't like his answers.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.760]   - Well, again, let me ask,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   if we look at the deepest nature of reality,
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.320]   whether it's deterministic
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.080]   or when observed as probabilistic,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.980]   what does that mean for our human level
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.340]   of ideas of free will?
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.080]   Is there any connection whatsoever from this perception,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.800]   perhaps illusion of free will that we have
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.760]   and the fundamental nature of reality?
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.400]   - The only thing I can say is I am puzzled by that
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.680]   as much as you are.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.520]   - The illusion of it.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.120]   - The illusion of consciousness,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.020]   the illusion of free will, the illusion of self.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.400]   - Does that connect to--
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.520]   - How can a physical system do that?
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.880]   And I am as puzzled as anybody.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.760]   - There's echoes of it in the observer effect.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.600]   - Yeah.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.360]   - So do you understand what it means to be an observer?
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.720]   - I understand it at a technical level.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.520]   An observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.320]   that it can record information
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.000]   and which can become entangled
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.760]   with the thing that it's measuring.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.320]   Entanglement is the key.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.040]   When a system which we call an apparatus or an observer,
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.340]   same thing, interacts with the system that it's observing,
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.160]   it doesn't just look at it,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.600]   it becomes physically entangled with it.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.480]   And it's that entanglement which we call an observation
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.520]   or a measurement.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.000]   Now does that satisfy me personally as an observer?
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.380]   - Yes and no.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.860]   I find it very satisfying that we have
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.280]   a mathematical representation of what it means
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.360]   to observe a system.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.360]   - You are observing stuff right now.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.200]   - Yeah.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.020]   - The conscious level.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.860]   - Right.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.120]   - Do you think there's echoes of that kind of entanglement
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.480]   in our macro scale?
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.240]   - Yes, absolutely, for sure.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.040]   We're entangled with, quantum mechanically entangled
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.780]   with everything in this room.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.900]   If we weren't, then we would just,
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.780]   well, we wouldn't be observing it.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.660]   But on the other hand, you can ask,
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.300]   do I really, am I really comfortable with it?
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.580]   And I'm uncomfortable with it in the same way
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.340]   that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.540]   My brain isn't wired for it.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.420]   - Are you comfortable with four dimensions?
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.260]   - A little bit more because I can always imagine
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.380]   the fourth dimension is time.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.020]   - So the arrow of time, are you comfortable with that arrow?
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.020]   Do you think time is an emergent phenomena
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.740]   or is it fundamental to nature?
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.620]   - That is a big question in physics right now.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.780]   All the physics that we do, or at least at the people
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   that I am comfortable with talking to, my friends.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.180]   - Yeah.
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.460]   - My friends.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.940]   We all ask the same question that you just asked.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.300]   Space, we have a pretty good idea, is emergent.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   And it emerges out of entanglement and other things.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.940]   Time always seems to be built into our equations
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.700]   as just what Newton pretty much would have thought.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.140]   Newton modified a little bit by Einstein
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.380]   would have called time.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:16.980]   And mostly in our equations, it is not emergent.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.580]   Time in physics is completely symmetric,
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.420]   forward and backward. - Right, it's symmetric.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.300]   So you don't really need to think about the arrow of time
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.240]   for most physical phenomena.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.380]   - Most microscopic phenomena, no.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.620]   It's only when the phenomena involve systems
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.940]   which are big enough for thermodynamics to become important,
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.840]   for entropy to become important.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.020]   For a small system, entropy is not a good concept.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:52.840]   And entropy is something which emerges out of large numbers.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.600]   It's a probabilistic idea, it's a statistical idea,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.500]   and it's a thermodynamic idea.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.860]   Thermodynamics requires lots and lots
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.680]   and lots of little substructures.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:09.140]   So it's not until you emerge at the thermodynamic level
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.720]   that there's an arrow of time.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.540]   Do we understand it?
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.820]   Yeah, I think we understand better
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.180]   than most people think they have.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.340]   Most people say they think we understand it.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.300]   Yeah, I think we understand it.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.940]   It's a statistical idea.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.420]   - You mean like second law of thermodynamics,
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.260]   entropy and so on? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.740]   Take a pack of cards and you fling it in the air
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.460]   and you look what happens to it.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.380]   It gets random. - Yeah, but we understand it.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.220]   - It doesn't go from random to simple.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.740]   It goes from simple to random.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.820]   - But do you think it ever breaks down?
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.180]   - What I think you can do is in a laboratory setting,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.020]   you can take a system which is somewhere intermediate
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.180]   between being small and being large
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:56.100]   and make it go backward.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.580]   A thing which looks like it only wants to go forward
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.660]   because of statistical mechanical reasons,
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.900]   because of the second law,
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.120]   you can very, very carefully manipulate it
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.100]   to make it run backward.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.660]   I don't think you can take an egg,
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.000]   a Humpty Dumpty who fell on the floor and reverse that.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.500]   But you can, in a very controlled situation,
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.780]   you can take systems which appear to be evolving
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.380]   statistically toward randomness,
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.280]   stop them, reverse them and make them go back.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.780]   - What's the intuition behind that?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.940]   How do we do that?
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.500]   How do we reverse it?
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.580]   You're saying a closed system?
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.340]   - Yeah, pretty much closed system, yes.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.580]   - Did you just say that time travel is possible?
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.060]   - No, I didn't say time travel is possible.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.960]   I said you can make a system go backward.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.800]   - In time.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.020]   - You can make it go back, you can make it reverse
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.560]   its steps, you can make it reverse its trajectory.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.440]   - Yeah.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.280]   How do we do it?
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.660]   What's the intuition there?
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.780]   Does it have, is it just a fluke thing
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.880]   that we can do at a small scale in the lab
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.720]   that doesn't have--
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.680]   - What I'm saying is you can do it
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.300]   on a little bit better than a small scale.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   You can certainly do it with a simple small system.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   Small systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   Atoms, atoms are no sense of an arrow of time.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.420]   They're completely reversible.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.480]   It's only when you have, you know,
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.520]   the second law of thermodynamics is the law of large numbers.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.840]   - So you can break the law because it's not--
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.920]   - You can break it, but it's hard.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.120]   It requires great care.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.480]   The bigger the system is, the more care,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.800]   the more, the harder it is.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.960]   You have to overcome what's called chaos.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.640]   And that's hard.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   And it requires more and more precision.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.120]   For 10 particles, you might be able to do it
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.040]   with some effort.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.820]   For 100 particles, it's really hard.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.360]   For 1,000 or a million particles, forget it.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.260]   But not for any fundamental reason,
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.760]   just because it's technologically too hard
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.700]   to make the system go backward.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:13.360]   - So, no time travel for engineering reasons.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.320]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.920]   What is time travel?
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.440]   Time travel to the future, that's easy.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   You just close your eyes, go to sleep,
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.520]   and you wake up in the future.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.960]   A good nap gets you there, yeah.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.400]   - A good nap gets you there, right.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.280]   - But in reversing the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.840]   the going backward in time,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.780]   for anything that's human scale
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.020]   is a very difficult engineering effort.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.440]   - I wouldn't call that time travel
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.040]   because it gets too mixed up
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   with what science fiction calls time travel.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   This is just the ability to reverse a system.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.680]   You take the system, and you reverse the direction
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.000]   of motion of every molecule in it.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.940]   You can do it with one molecule.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.500]   If you find a particle moving in a certain direction,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.720]   let's not say a particle, a baseball,
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.960]   you stop it dead, and then you simply reverse its motion,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.840]   in principle that's not too hard,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.240]   and it'll go back along its trajectory
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.440]   in the backward direction.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.200]   - Just running the program backwards.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.440]   - Running the program backward.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.400]   If you have two baseballs colliding,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.820]   well you can do it, but you have to be very, very careful
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.920]   to get it just right.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:32.400]   If you have 10 baseballs, really, really, or better yet,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.200]   10 billiard balls on an idealized,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.820]   frictionless billiard table.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   Okay, so you start the balls all in a triangle, right?
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.480]   And you whack 'em.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.640]   Depending on the game you're playing,
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.040]   you either whack 'em or you're really careful,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.360]   but you whack 'em, and they go flying off
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.880]   in all possible directions.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.200]   Try to reverse that.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.720]   Try to reverse that.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   Imagine trying to take every billiard ball,
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.360]   stopping it dead at some point,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.420]   and reversing its motion so that it was going
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.240]   in the opposite direction.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.400]   If you did that with tremendous care,
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.560]   it would reassemble itself back into the triangle.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.780]   Okay, that is a fact, and you can probably do it
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.320]   with two billiard balls, maybe with three billiard balls
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.960]   if you're really lucky.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.440]   But what happens is as the system gets more and more
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.160]   complicated, you have to be more and more precise
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.920]   not to make the tiniest error,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.000]   because the tiniest errors will get magnified,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.960]   and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.600]   So yeah, but I wouldn't call that time travel.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.720]   - Yeah, that's something else.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.280]   But if you think of it, it just made me think,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.200]   if you think the unrolling of state that's happening
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.880]   as a program, if we look at the world,
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.480]   so the idea of looking at the world as a simulation,
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.060]   as a computer, but it's not a computer,
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.940]   it's just a single program.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.800]   A question arises that might be useful.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   How hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe?
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.560]   - Okay, so there are mathematical universes
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.760]   that we know about, one of them is called
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.640]   anti-de Sitter space, where we,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.000]   and it's quantum mechanics, where I think we could
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.120]   simulate it in a computer, in a quantum computer.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.600]   Classical computer, all you can do is solve its equations,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.120]   you can't make it work like the real system.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.560]   If we could build a quantum computer, a big enough one,
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.360]   a robust enough one, we could probably simulate
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:52.280]   a universe, a small version of an anti-de Sitter universe.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.760]   Anti-de Sitter is a kind of a cosmology.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.240]   All right, so I think we know how to do that.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.320]   The trouble is, the universe that we live in
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.800]   is not the anti-de Sitter geometry,
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.080]   it's the de Sitter geometry, and we don't really understand
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   its quantum mechanics at all.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.960]   So at the present time, I would say we wouldn't have
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.400]   the vaguest idea how to simulate a universe
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.480]   similar to our own.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.080]   No, we can ask, could we build in the laboratory
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   a small version, a quantum mechanical version,
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.480]   a collection of quantum computers entangled
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.440]   and coupled together, which would reproduce
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.160]   the phenomena that go on in the universe,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.440]   even on a small scale?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.080]   Yes, if it were anti-de Sitter space.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.720]   No, if it's de Sitter space.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.440]   - Can you slightly describe de Sitter space
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.680]   and anti-de Sitter space?
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.880]   - Yeah.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.440]   - What are the geometric properties of--
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.880]   - They differ by the sign of a single constant
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.680]   called the cosmological constant.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.760]   One of them is negatively curved,
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.680]   the other is positively curved.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.240]   Anti-de Sitter space, which is the negatively curved one,
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.360]   you can think of as an isolated system
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.600]   in a box with reflecting walls.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.480]   You could think of it as a system of,
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.240]   a quantum mechanical system isolated
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.800]   in an isolated environment.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.720]   De Sitter space is the one we really live in,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.240]   and that's the one that's exponentially expanding.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.040]   Exponential expansion, dark energy,
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.520]   whatever you want to call it,
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.300]   and we don't understand that mathematically.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.960]   - Do we understand--
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.200]   - Not everybody would agree with me,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.560]   but I don't understand.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.640]   They would agree with me, they definitely would agree
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.440]   with me that I don't understand it.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.740]   (laughing)
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.000]   - What about, is there an understanding
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.320]   of the birth, the origin, the Bing Bang?
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.160]   - No, no, no, there's theories.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   There are theories.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.000]   My favorite is the one called eternal inflation.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.680]   - The infinity can be on both sides,
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.600]   on one of the sides, and none of the sides.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.520]   So what's eternal infinity?
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.360]   - Okay.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:11.120]   Infinity on both sides.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.920]   - Oh boy.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.480]   - Yeah, yeah, that's--
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.520]   - Why is that your favorite?
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   'Cause it's the most, just mind-blowing?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.380]   - No.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.200]   - 'Cause we want a beginning.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.960]   - No, why do we want a beginning?
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.800]   I--
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.400]   - In practice, there was a beginning, of course.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.280]   In practice, there was a beginning.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   But could it have been a random fluctuation
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.360]   in an otherwise infinite time?
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.200]   Maybe.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.880]   In any case, the eternal inflation theory,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.320]   I think if correctly understood,
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.280]   would be infinite in both directions.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.880]   - How do you think about infinity?
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.000]   - Oh God.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.560]   - So, okay, of course you can think about it mathematically.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.640]   - I just finished this discussion
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.200]   with my friend Sergey Brin.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.020]   - Yes.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.860]   - How do you think about infinity?
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.360]   I say, well, Sergey Brin is infinitely rich.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.000]   (laughing)
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.400]   - How do you test that hypothesis?
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.240]   Okay.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.320]   That's such a good line.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.160]   Right.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.200]   Yeah, so there's really no way
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.880]   to visualize some of these things.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.400]   - Yeah, no, this is a very good question.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.680]   Does physics have any,
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.360]   does infinity have any place in physics?
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.200]   - Right.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.600]   - Right, and all I can say is, very good question.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:39.400]   - So what do you think of the recent first image
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.040]   of a black hole visualized from the Event Horizon Telescope?
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.680]   - It's an incredible triumph of science.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.760]   In itself, the fact that there are black holes
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.640]   which collide is not a surprise.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.680]   And they seem to work exactly
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.800]   the way they're supposed to work.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.080]   Will we learn a great deal from it?
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.180]   I don't know, I can't, we might.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.320]   But the kind of things we'll learn
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   won't really be about black holes.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:09.520]   Why there are black holes in nature
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.800]   of that particular mass scale and why they're so common
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.720]   may tell us something about the structure,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.480]   evolution of structure in the universe.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.560]   But I don't think it's gonna tell us
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.040]   anything new about black holes.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.480]   But it's a triumph in the sense that you go back 100 years
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.240]   and it was a continuous development,
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.520]   general relativity, the discovery of black holes,
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.540]   LIGO, the incredible technology that went into LIGO.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:42.640]   It is something that I never would have believed
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.800]   was gonna happen 30, 40 years ago.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.840]   And I think it's a magnificent structure,
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   a magnificent thing, this evolution of general relativity,
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:04.000]   LIGO, high precision, ability to measure things
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.300]   on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.440]   So, yeah.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.320]   - So you're just in awe-- - Astonishing.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.800]   Just in awe. - That this path
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.840]   took us to this picture.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.880]   Is it different?
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.920]   You've thought a lot about black holes.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.460]   How did you visualize them in your mind?
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.320]   And is the picture different than you realized it?
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.780]   - No, it simply confirmed.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.280]   It's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed--
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.960]   - Confirmed. - A direct observation
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.400]   that Einstein's theory of gravity
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   at the level of black hole collisions actually works.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.480]   It's awesome, it is really awesome.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.600]   You know, I know some of the people
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.240]   who are involved in that.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.000]   They're just ordinary people.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.680]   And the idea that they could carry this out,
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.500]   I just, I'm shocked.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.400]   - Yeah, just these little homo sapiens.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.320]   - Yeah, just these little monkeys.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.840]   - Got together and took a picture of--
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.740]   - Slightly advanced limers, I think.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.360]   - What kind of questions can science not currently answer
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.480]   but you hope might be able to soon?
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.120]   - Well, you've already addressed them.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.040]   What is consciousness, for example?
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.440]   - You think that's within the reach of science?
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.680]   - I think it's somewhat within the reach of science,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.720]   but I think now it's in the hands
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.160]   of the computer scientists and the neuroscientists.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.520]   - Not a physicist.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.840]   - Perhaps at some point. - With the help.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.120]   - But I think physicists will try to simplify it down
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.360]   to something that they can use their methods
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.600]   and maybe they're not appropriate.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   Maybe we simply need to do more machine learning
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.840]   on bigger scales, evolve machines.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.400]   Machines not only that learn,
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.360]   but evolve their own architecture
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   as a process of learning, evolving architecture,
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.000]   not under our control, only partially under our control,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.260]   but under the control of a machine learning.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.760]   I'll tell you another thing that I find awesome.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.840]   You know this Google thing
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.520]   that they taught computers how to play chess?
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.880]   - Yeah, yeah. - Okay.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.660]   They taught computers how to play chess,
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.440]   not by teaching them how to play chess,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.400]   but just having them play against each other.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.440]   - Against each other, self-play.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.280]   - Against each other.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.840]   This is a form of evolution.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.000]   These machines evolved.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.940]   They evolved in intelligence.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.400]   They evolved in intelligence
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.880]   without anybody telling them how to do it.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.560]   They were not engineered.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.000]   They just played against each other
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.840]   and got better and better and better.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   That makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.600]   What exact kind of intelligence, I don't know,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.040]   but in understanding that better and better,
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.720]   maybe we'll get better clues
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.040]   as to what goes on in our own intelligence.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.920]   - Well, life and intelligence is, last question,
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.880]   what kind of questions can science not currently answer
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   and may never be able to answer?
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.720]   - Yeah.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.340]   Is there an intelligence out there
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.280]   that's underlies the whole thing?
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.040]   You can call them with a G word if you want.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.960]   I can say, are we a computer simulation with a purpose?
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:22.600]   Is there an agent, an intelligent agent
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.200]   that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing?
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.600]   Does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics?
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.640]   Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics?
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.480]   Is it made of atoms and molecules?
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.560]   Yeah, there's a lot of questions.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.080]   And I don't see, it seems to me a real question.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.520]   - It's an answerable question.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.800]   - Well, I don't know if it's answerable.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.360]   The questions have to be answerable to be real.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:52.240]   Some philosophers would say that a question
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.520]   is not a question unless it's answerable.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.320]   This question doesn't seem to me answerable
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   by any known method, but it seems to me real.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.200]   - There's no better place to end.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.760]   Leonard, thank you so much for talking today.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.600]   - Okay, good.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:35.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
