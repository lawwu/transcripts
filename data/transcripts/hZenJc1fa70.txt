[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   The following is a conversation with Niels Jorgensen, a New York firefighter for over 21 years,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.400]   who was there at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.680]   He was forced to retire because of the leukemia he contracted from cleaning up Ground Zero.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.520]   This podcast tells his story, and the story of other great men and women who were there that day.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.160]   Some of the stories we talk about are part of a new limited podcast series that Niels hosts
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.800]   called "20 for 20" with 20 episodes for the 20 years since 9/11.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.440]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   As a side note, please allow me to say a few words about the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.600]   I was in downtown Chicago on that day, lost in the mundane busyness of an early Tuesday morning.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.000]   At that time, I was already fascinated by human nature, the best and the worst of it,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.880]   exploring it through the study of history and literature.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.200]   In the years before, as a young boy growing up in Russia, I saw chaos, uncertainty, and desperation
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   in the Soviet Union of the 1990s, wrapping up a century of war and suffering.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.600]   But after coming to America for me, there was a sense of hope, like all of it was behind us,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.920]   a bad dream to be forgotten as we enter into the new century.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.200]   On 9/11, when I saw the news of the second plane hitting the towers, my sense of hope had changed.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.960]   I understood that the 21st century, like the century before, would too have its tragedies,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.360]   its evildoers, its wars, and its suffering.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.280]   And unlike the history books, these stories will involve all of us.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.440]   They will involve me in however small and insignificant a role,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.680]   but one that nevertheless carries the responsibility to help.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.440]   I became an American that day, a citizen of the world.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.840]   I felt the common humanity in all of us.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.080]   I felt the unity and the love in the days that followed, and I think most of the world
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.000]   shared in this feeling, that we are all in this together.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.240]   Evil cannot defeat the human spirit.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.800]   There were many heroes sung and unsung on that day, and in the years after.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.640]   Often, politicians fail to rightfully honor the service and sacrifice of these heroes.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.400]   There is much I could say about that, but I don't want to waste my words on the failures of weak leaders.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.800]   Instead, I want to say thank you to the men and women who rushed to ground zero to help,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.600]   who put on a uniform to serve, who make me proud to be an American and a human being,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.840]   and give me hope about the future of our civilization, here on a small spinning rock
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   that despite the long odds, keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.280]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:20.280]   Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001, as you experienced it, as you lived it.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   September 11th, 2001 was a bright, beautiful, sunny Tuesday morning.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.680]   It was a late summer.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.640]   There's a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey, call it the short summer.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   Everybody's left there for Labor Day, but it's still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   I left my house about 6.30 in the morning, and my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter said to me,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   "Daddy, which truck are you driving today, the fire truck, the oil truck, or the Boar's Head truck?"
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   Because I had three jobs at the time, most New York City firefighters and police officers, EMS.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   You don't make the most amount of money, so in order to live in that city, you have to hustle.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   My wife stayed at home raising the children.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   My daughter said, "Oh, you should be safe because you're on the oil truck."
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   I told her I was going on the oil truck that day.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   She said, "You should be safe today, Daddy."
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   I left and worked for this great company on the North Shore, Staten Island, Quinlan Fuel.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   Very nice people, treated me very well.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   It was my first day back, actually, for the winter season.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   I usually get laid off a couple months in the summer because things are too hot to need oil.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.640]   I took the truck, started my route that day, and a plane hit the tower.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   Initially, I'm like, "Oh, it's probably some silly Learjet pilot," and he veered off track to get a better picture for a client,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   and he hit the building.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   Probably hit a bad turbulence, gust of wind.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   It was windy down in that area, Manhattan, so that was my first thought.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   Can we pause there for a second?
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   6.30 a.m., you wake up, you leave, and then the plane hits at 8.45, 8.50, 8.45 a.m.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.640]   It's just interesting how you phrase it.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   How did you hear that a plane hit something?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   I'm a big news radio guy, news guy, bit of a buff.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   I've been that way since I was a kid, and I had the news radio on the local New York radio station.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   As I was driving the truck, I heard an emergency report, "This just in. Aircraft has just struck the World Trade Center."
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   Where Quinlans is located, it's on the north rim of Staten Island, which is right on New York Harbor.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   You could see the Statue of Liberty a mile or two away in the distance, and then past that is the towers.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   I just literally stopped the truck and looked out, and I saw the smoke.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   There was smoke?
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   Oh, it was dark, black smoke.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   It was just burning fully at that point.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   Did you have fear of what the hell happened?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   I was initially scared for anybody involved.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   I realized, I said, "There's going to be lots of fatalities, obviously, depending on the size of the aircraft."
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   The business day there had started probably at 8, 830, so those buildings should have been packed at that moment.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   That was a thought that crossed my mind.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   From our being responder perspective, if you're off duty, normally you do not go to a scene.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   They don't want you to because of accountability and safety.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   The on-duty platoon will handle it, and if it's something very horrific, then they will have something called a recall,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   which is any police, firefighter, or EMS personnel is obligated to go to their command immediately, check in with their command,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   get their gear, and stand by and await orders for deployment or to remain in that command for routine duties.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   How often throughout history have there been recalls?
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   I believe the one prior to that was in the 1968 riots, possibly, and then maybe in the '70s there was another blackout and riots.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   I remember my dad talking about it, and he actually always said, "Just remember if something bad's going down,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   don't just rush in. You will wait the recall, or at the very least, if there isn't a recall, you get to your firehouse."
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   Because if you show up somewhere, there's a good chance that no one knows you're there,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   and now in your well-intended movements, you get lost or trapped, or no one's looking for you.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   So that's the whole thing with checking in, and now you're with a squad or group of guys, and everyone knows,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   "Hey, there's Nils, there's Lex. Okay, they're on this team."
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   So I said, "All right, they're not going to need us. It's probably going to be a fifth alarm, and there'll be 250 firefighters there.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   They'll handle it. It's going to be a bad day for those guys, but our guys take on some heavy stuff, and they'll be fine."
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   A few minutes later, the second plane hit, and I knew immediately, I'm like, "Okay, we're under attack."
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   So I just flew the truck back in. I told my boss I have to go.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   He understood. He knew something was way wrong, and I just was flying.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   At the time, I actually had a yellow Volkswagen Beetle, kind of a goofy car to be driving, but I loved it.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   So for people who are just listening, you're kind of a big guy.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   Well, yeah, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   No, I don't mean it that way. You're framed. Big hands.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   As my beloved friend Bobby Adams would say to me, "I was driving around in a clown wagon,"
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   and he also says, "I have a waving hairdo, waving bye-bye." So thanks, Bobby.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.640]   Good luck.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   Yeah, he's a great friend.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen, and I flew in, and I was heading over to Verrazano Bridge and hit the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   My phone rang, and my wife normally doesn't curse or raise her voice, and she was yelling at me.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   She said, "Don't go in there. Go to your firehouse."
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   Well, first she asked where. She knew I was on the way, but she just wanted to know where.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   I said, "I'm on the curve," which is 65th Street on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway called Dead Man's Curve.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   We actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there, and I was hitting that curve pretty fast.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:47.640]   Then right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse, and I had to decide, "Well, am I driving right in to the battery tunnel to the city, or am I going to the firehouse?"
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   I said, "But I have no gear. I'm going to be ineffective. How do I show up with no gear, no protection?"
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   She said, "Do what your dad would follow the recall, go to the firehouse."
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   I hung up the phone, said, "I love you. Got to go."
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   I did. I went to the firehouse, and I'm glad I listened to her.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   I had my father ringing in my ears.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   My dad, beautiful guy. He's 82, did 34 years in New York City Fire Department.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.640]   He came down and end-staged non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   He's 38, going on 39, 1978.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   This guy, he's my hero.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   He was going to die. They sent him home.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   They said, "There's really not much we can do. Go get your affairs."
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   He says, "But Doc, I have three young kids."
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   She called him a couple hours later. She said, "I got in touch with Sloan Kettering, and they have a new drug.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   We want you to be a test pilot."
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   He said, "Hey, Doc, he's got a heavy Brooklyn accent. I'm a fireman. I'm a fireman. I'm not a pilot."
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   She said, "No, no. We want you to try this drug out. If it works, we might have some success.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   But if not," he says, "Yeah, I'm going to die. So let's do it."
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   So every two weeks for four years, he'd go for treatment.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   But he was assigned to a desk job after that, after the cancer tumor removal and the heavy treatments.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   He'd get up every morning at 4 o'clock in the morning, and he'd walk down to the train station in Staten Island, take the train.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   Then he'd take the ferry across the harbor.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   He'd get off looking at the towers, and then he'd take a subway into Brooklyn.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   On every other Thursday, he'd leave at noon, do the same exact reverse route, and he'd get to the cancer center.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   My mom would meet him, and he'd get his infusion.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   Within two hours, he'd be violently ill for a few days, really badly ill.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:10.640]   I just remember I was 10 years old, and he just had to have the room darkened out, and he'd be so sick.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   I'd just go in and wipe the vomit on his face, just try to give him a little water, but he couldn't take it down because he'd throw it up.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   Maybe on Saturday, he'd start coming around a little bit, drink down a little bit of tea.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   On Sunday morning, he'd put his robe on, he'd go down, mom would make him black coffee and toast.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   He'd sit up, watch the news, watch a game, and then Monday morning, he'd go back to work.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   He did that for four years.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   He's 82, and he's still here.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   You said that your dad's a man of a few words, but when he talks, they're profound.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   What words were ringing in your ear when you were driving?
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   I just always remember him saying, "Kid, they give the recall.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   You go to the firehouse.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   You don't go where you think you should.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   You go to the firehouse.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   You follow your orders."
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   So do the smart thing, do your job.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   Yes, sir.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   Every time we'd hang up the phone, it's fireman talk.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   He'd say, "I love you.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   Keep low."
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   My dad couldn't tell me he loved me until I told him when I first got on a fire department.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   I was 22, and my dad grew up in a tough household.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   My granddad was a good man, but a tormented man.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   He was sent away from home at 12 years old.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   He was from Denmark, and I'm named after him, Grandpa Nils.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   I think his demons took up a large part of his life, his anger, whatever it was, his fear.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   We got the sense that maybe when he was a child, he was an apprentice baker, living with strangers,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   working for them, and we think maybe he was abused, and that's why he took it out on my dad,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.640]   and my grandma, and my aunts.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.640]   They made it up to each other at the end of my granddad's life.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.640]   My granddad turned out to be the best grandfather ever.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   I think he tried to heal and heal everyone by his change of behavior.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   He's proof that you can change.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   You can improve if you work on it.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   I know I'm going off track here.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   But you were a man enough, you say, in your 20s to tell your dad that you love him?
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   My dad, yeah.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.640]   I got on the job, and he said, "How'd it go, kid?
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640]   "How was the tour?"
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.640]   We called it Tour of Duty.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.640]   I said, "Oh, Dad, it was great.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   "It was great.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   "I love it."
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.640]   He goes, "Just remember, you keep low.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   "You always keep low, and keep low means you stay down below the flames.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   "If a room flashes over and it's burning, if you stay up high, you're going to get burned badly,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   "but if you get down on your belly and you crawl, you'll get out."
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   He'd always say that when he'd hang up the phone.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   I said, "Well, I love you, Pop."
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   He says, "Well, thanks, kid."
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   I said, "Well, you can say it, too."
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   Oh, nice.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   You pressured him.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   He did, and he said it.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   Now, every time we talk, he says it.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   They talk about masculinity and whatnot.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   My dad is one of those tough, tough guys with a soft edge,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   and that's how he brought me up, to be a protector.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   I hate bullies.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.640]   I was bullied really badly as a kid, and I really hated it.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   Now I find myself sometimes throwing myself into situations to protect people that are being violated and hurt,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   and I just can't walk away from it, but that's my dad.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   My dad was that, just a great guy.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   But anyway--
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   I still listen to you, therefore, see, you probably want to rush right to the towers, but you went--
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   Yeah, so anyway, I did.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   I listened to him.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   I listened to my wife.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   I went to the firehouse, and it was really strange.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   It was eerie because the computer dispatch system was still beeping,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   which meant it sent a dispatch, and the truck received it, Ladder 114.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   My truck company received it, and they left.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   They were gone.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   It was this beautiful old building built in the 1880s with a spiral staircase,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   just a narrow old brick garage, and it was empty, and I just heard the computer chirping.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   I looked down on a ticket, and it said, "Ladder 114 respond.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.640]   Vessian West World Trade Center aircraft into building."
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   I said, "Oh, God, I just hope they're not on a death ride because this now was two towers,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.640]   and they were burning.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   They were free burning, and I knew this was really, really bad."
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   I got on the phone, and I called commands right away.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.640]   I called the 40th Battalion, and Chief's Aid just said, "Look, get 12 guys.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   Sign them in."
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   To the journal, there was a journal of daily events,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   everything that takes place in the firehouse 24/7 has to be logged.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   I logged myself as coming in, reporting for duty, and as the guys came in,
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   I logged them in, and then one of our lieutenants took command.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   We grabbed up a bunch of gear, and they basically told us, "Get 12 guys.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   Get a city bus and get down to the battery tunnel."
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   They said it would probably be closed.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   There was threats it was going to be blown up to get to the Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   So we did.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   We got a city bus.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   We flagged it down, and the bus driver said, "I'm sorry.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   I can't give you the bus.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   I will drive you."
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   He took us, and we stopped at Engine 201, which is just about a quarter mile
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.640]   down the road from us.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   That's our affiliated engine company, and my childhood best friend here, Johnny,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   was assigned there, and he was on shift.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   They went through the tunnel.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   We picked up those guys, the off-duty guys from 201,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   and we kept going down 4th Avenue, and we picked up 239's crew.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   Then we hightailed it down the bridge, and there was a lot of traffic.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   There was a lot of people fleeing, coming over the bridge in waves,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   so it affected the inbound.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   What was the mood like among the crew?
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   It was somber because just prior to getting on the bus, the first tower went down.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   So we figured that--I heard 114, my lieutenant, Dennis Oberg.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   I heard him on the radio, and he said, "114 to Manhattan.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   We're on your frequency.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   What do you need us?"
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.640]   They said, "Tally Ho," which is our nickname.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.640]   "Tally Ho, respond in the Vessian West to the command post and receive your orders."
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.640]   I heard Dennis say, "Tally Ho, 10-4."
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   Dennis, a little while after that, they were proceeding to go into--
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   I believe it was--I get this mixed up, and I'm sorry.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.640]   I should know this by the back of my hand, but sometimes it's just such a haze.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   The second tower hit was the first one to go down,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   and they were heading over to go in it, and all of a sudden he looked up,
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   and he saw what he thought to be disintegration, and he turned the guys around.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   He said, "Run. Just run. Don't look back. Don't look up. Go."
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   They sprinted as fast as they could, and they dove under a fire truck,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   and the guys that were sprinting behind him 40 feet away were underneath a pile
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   that was 10 stories deep.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   They were killed, and just further into that pile was his rookie son,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   who Dennis' rookie son, who was working in Ladder 105,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   which was my first command on the department.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   I worked for--proudly served for three years,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   and just beside them was my childhood best friend, John Shard,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   and his crew from 201, and they were all killed.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   The strange irony to that is that Dennis' son, Dennis Jr.,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   was working underneath the--under the wing of a senior man, as we say.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   A senior man is a guy with a lot of experience,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   and he'll watch over you, make sure you don't veer off,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:23.640]   like I veer off a lot in talking, and you don't veer off and you get yourself hurt.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   In the morning of the 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   and I was the young guy under his wing, and he protected me,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   and toward the end of the day, he looked around, and he said,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   "Kid, it's a bad day."
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   He said, "They didn't do it right.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.640]   They blew it up in the middle.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   If they did it in a corner, they would have dropped this building
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   half a mile down at Canal Street, but don't kid yourself.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   They'll be back, and they'll do it, and they'll do it right next time."
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   And it's so strange and so prophetic because he was there with them,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   and he died with Dennis, and he knew it.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   In 1994, we had a training manual with a picture of the towers with a target,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   and it said, "Not a matter of if, but a matter of when be prepared."
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   And it's haunting.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   It was like people knew, right?
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   And we didn't stop it.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   And so we got off the bus, but just prior to that coming over the bridge,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.640]   the second tower was gone now, and was just destroyed because we're like,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   "Our guys are there.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   They're all in there."
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   Now we're feeling like cowards because we got there late,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   and initially we're thinking there's 500 guys that are gone because
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   there was a 10th alarm assignment, which means 50, 60 fire trucks,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   five to six guys per.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   You're looking at at least--no, it was even more.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   A 10th alarm plus multiple alarms on top of it.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   It was a dispatch basically equivalent of five to six hundred firefighters.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   We figured they're all in there, all gone.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.640]   All the police officers, Port Authority police, NYPD police,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   court officers just up the street from the courts,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   transit cops from the train tunnels.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   We knew everybody was going, and now they're gone.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   So what you saw--what were we looking at?
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   What did it look like?
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   So you saw rubble, and then you knew that 105 and 201,
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   many of those guys are in the--they're dead.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   What did you see?
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   114 was in there too.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   We didn't realize at that point--we didn't even realize that they had
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   gotten under that truck.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   We thought they were all gone, but yeah, it looked like a movie scene
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   with just end of the earth destruction.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   It's just massive piles of intertwined steel,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   what was left of the steel.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   And there was no cement.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   It was all just dust, and it was just a burning pile of dust
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   and concrete and plastic, and it was just--everything was just pulverized.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   And it was truly hard to mentally compute that.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   It was like, what?
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.640]   And then there was just fighter jets, a couple of fighter jets just circling,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.640]   and you just heard the--flying by over your head.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.640]   I mean, you literally see the guy banking a turn around the Brooklyn Bridge
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   and just coming back, and I'm like, holy shoot, we're under attack?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   And we couldn't really get concrete intel as to what exactly--we knew planes,
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   but then we kept hearing there was multiple devices,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   there was devices in a battery tunnel, and there was devices on a
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   George Washington Bridge, and in the subways, and it was just chaos.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   I mean, we kept it together, obviously, because that's kind of--we try,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   that's what we do, but the just constant barrage of different reports,
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   it was like, holy shoot.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   And then as we were being deployed, it was a little frustrating,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.640]   but they were trying to take command and send us in groups now
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.640]   because they realized we have to start searching this.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.640]   You could hear the alarms on the Scott Airmasks,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.640]   the packs we wear to go into the building.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   It has a motion alarm, and if you stop moving for 30 seconds,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   it just sounds like this whining, this screaming bell,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   and it just keeps going and going.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   And you could hear multiple units of those going off, and you're like,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   wait a minute, there's guys with those, where are they?
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   And it's emanating from underneath the pile.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   And it was just surreal and truly like a war zone.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves, and I never saw combat,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   and I would never claim that I did, but we trained.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   We trained for a lot of situations, and we trained in real-life atmospheres
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   and whatnot, and this was just beyond that by leaps and bounds.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   It was bizarre.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   Did you see the towers collapse?
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   As we were coming over the bridge, the first one,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   as we were deploying from the firehouse, we had a television on,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   and I saw it go down, and it just--it was just like--
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   and we were so involved in getting gear together and getting, okay,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   team set up, and okay, you're going to be with these two guys.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   And I just yelled, I said, guys, and they're looking at me.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   I dropped to my knees, and I started praying.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   They're like, what the hell is wrong?
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   I couldn't even say.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   It's like, 114, they're in there.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   And they're like, what?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   I said, the tower's gone.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   I guess because they didn't see it going down,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   they probably thought I truly lost it.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   And then the realization came, it was like, wow, the tower's down.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   So now it was like, wow, this is really on.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   So we just took off and got that boss.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   So if you thought many of the guys on 114 were dead,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   if you thought that, did you think you were going to die?
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   I mean, if you're rushing into the--towards the rubble.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   As crazy as it sounds, I never thought that the other tower would go down.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   I said, okay, maybe some freak chance that one went down.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   But no, the other one's not going to go.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   Like, they're built so strong.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   I was in those towers so many times, and I mean,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   I ate dinner up in the top four restaurant windows in the world,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   and I'm saying, nah, there's no way.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   Like, how the hell did this one happen?
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   But I was having a hard time mentally processing that the building was gone.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   And believe me, if you don't have fear in this industry,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   and police, fire, military, then you're kidding yourself
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   or you're a danger to everyone.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   I don't care who it is, as tough as they are, this and that.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.640]   Everybody has a certain level of fear with doing this.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   And I don't care how long you do it, there's always that chance of something going bad.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   And everyone who does it has that certain amount of fear.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   But at that point, it was such a feeling of disbelief,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   that fear wasn't even kicking in.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   It was just like, what the hell just happened?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   And I honestly think it was almost like a shock, and it just stayed that whole day.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   The building is, before it collapses, is burning.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   It's just burning.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   I mean, upper floors, up in the 78th, up to the 80s,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   and then there's the way that the cut was from the plane.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   It wasn't just straight across.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   It was from the 78th, then on up to maybe the 86th.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   Then the jet fuel had come down and was burning down,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   and there was people on the ground who were doused with jet fuel
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   and were already burning, and they were lit on fire on the ground.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   It was just insane how vast the destruction path was.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   As a firefighter, what are you supposed to do with that scale of fire?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   I think the first bosses in, the first chiefs,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   were just going to do their best to get--
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   as we get hose lines, what our whole theory is, or our tactics is,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   is to get water at the fire, at the base of the fire,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   and get the truck company, which is the ladder company.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   They're the guys who break the doors down, put ladders up, this and that,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.640]   to get them to where the life is most expected
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   and get them out of there.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   So I think the chief's tactics at that point was,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   "Let me get multiple engine companies.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Let me get four, five, six hose lines fighting this fire,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   this massive fire, and let me get 15, 20 truck companies up there
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   just yoking people out of there."
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   Yeah, but you got to go up the stair. Everything's not working.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   Yeah, guys had to walk up 80, 90, 100 flights of stairs,
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   and there's audio of officers and firefighters
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   speaking to each other on the radio channels.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   And unfortunately, at that point in time,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   we had a very, very bad communication system.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   We'd been fighting for years to get radios that worked properly.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   We couldn't because it was a lot of money.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   We fought for years to get the full bunker firefighting suits,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   which is the pants and the coat.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   We used to have just coats and these roll-up rubber boots,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   and guys were burning to death, and we had to fight.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   And unfortunately, we lost three guys in one vicious, vicious fire in 1994,
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   and then they finally said, "Enough's enough. Give these guys the gear."
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.640]   So it's a strange phenomenon in the first responder world
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   and in the military world.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   It's really one of the most important things that takes place in society,
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   the most pertinent organizations, and we can't get the funding we need.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   It's crazy.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   They'll throw money at every nonsensical thing,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   but when it comes to gear, equipment, protective equipment,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   trucks, this--couldn't get it.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   Just all the ways you could take care of people.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   I saw since 9/11, the wars in the Middle East
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   have cost America over $6 trillion.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   And the amount of that money that was spent on the soldiers,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   in this case the first responders, is minimal.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   Compared to it, yeah.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   Almost nothing.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   They closed down--I believe it's either seven or eight.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   In May of 2002, they closed down nine firehouses in New York City
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   for budget reasons.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   We hadn't even finished cleaning up the World Trade Center site,
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.640]   and they slashed the budget, and still to this day
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   have not reopened those firehouses.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   There's a million more people now living in New York City
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   than there were in 2001, and the fire protection is way less than it was.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   It's a sin.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   It's really a sin.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Can I ask you a difficult question?
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   So there's this famous photograph of a falling man.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   Many people had to decide when they're above the fire or in the fire
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   whether to jump out of the building or to burn to death.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   What do you make of that decision?
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   What do you make of that situation?
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   Those people who jumped, those were acts of sheer desperation.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   I've been in fires, and just minor--burned, but minor--in situations.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   I've been trapped, caught somewhat,
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   ended up in a burn center for nothing serious at all.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:48.640]   But for those brief seconds, half a minute,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   thank God if I didn't have my fire gear on,
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   I would have been burned to a very, very horrible level.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   Those people were burning alive,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   and they had the choice of either to stay there and burn alive
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   or to launch themselves.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   And some of them, I don't fault them, but they had a few folks--
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   they won't show it anymore because they say--
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   I don't know why, I'd offend some people--
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   but they had a couple folks that took umbrellas
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   and they took garbage bags because they thought that it would
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   slow down their acceleration rate to the ground
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   and maybe, just maybe, they wouldn't be killed.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   And that's, to me, a true sense of desperation for humanity to say,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   "I'm going to die either way, but let me take my chance."
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   And I don't know the exact number of those folks who did that,
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   but our first member of the fire department killed,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   firefighter Daniel Serf, Engine 216,
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   was struck by a jumper.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   And one of my dear friends was ordered to help take him,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   and they knew he was passed away because he was hit by a flying missile.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   I mean, 120 miles an hour, a body lands on you,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.640]   those two bodies are now crushed.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   And they were ordered to take that firefighter
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   and bring him across the street to Engine 10, Ladder 10.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   It was literally a firehouse, less than 100 yards
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   from the facade of the Trade Center, from the Trade Center complex.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   They were literally right there.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   landed into the front doors, onto the roof,
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   but the building itself was not destroyed.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   So my friend was ordered to take Daniel's body in respect
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   and bring it over to this firehouse
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   and give it some semblance of dignity
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   and lay it out on one of the bunks we have in the bunkhouse
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   and just cover it with a sheet and put a sign,
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   "Please, firefighter killed, do not disturb,"
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   and say that to him later because obviously
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   this operation is going to go on for days.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   And my friend, who's such a great, wonderful guy,
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   is so still to this day filled with guilt
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.640]   because if they weren't taking his body out
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   with the respect and dignity that they did,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   it took a while because, you know, it's a tough situation.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   His ladder company was coming over the bridge.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   There's a famous picture of Ladder 118.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   You see this tractor trailer fire truck.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   It's the one where the guy in the back also drives.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.640]   And it's a zoomed-out shot, and you see the Brooklyn Bridge,
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   and you see only the fire truck in the middle,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   and you see the two burning towers in the distance.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   Well, his engine company was just ahead of them on the bridge,
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   and the only reason that engine company lived
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   is their initial duty assignment was to take that firefighter
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   and bring his body over.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   It's like the military. We don't leave anyone behind.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   These are our guys.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   As some guys say, it's all about the guy right next to you,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   and nothing else really matters.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   When that guy right next to you goes down, it stops.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   You get that guy to safety, or if he's dead, you get him out.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   So in that time frame, that saved his life.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   But that's a heavy burden to carry now
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   for the rest of your life because you say,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   "If I wasn't helping my dead friend, I'm dead."
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.640]   - Yeah.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   What did it look like at Ground Zero?
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   What did it feel like? What did it smell like?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   You said there was a sense that it was almost like a war zone,
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   but can you paint a picture of how much dust is in the air,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   how hot is it, how many people are there,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   and again, how did it feel like?
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   - It was just--it was a scene of controlled chaos,
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   controlled because there was a semblance of command,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   and we were just trying to do our jobs.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   But it was such a frantic pace because we're now digging frantically,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   knowing that there's life underneath this pile.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   - And this is throughout the afternoon of that evening?
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   - Yeah, I mean, this was nonstop, you know,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   just nonstop really for days, but for my particular crew,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   we literally kept going.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   We initially were dispatched over towards number seven,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   had just gone down, and we were searching the post office
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   that was there.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   There was reports of people trapped,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   and we painstakingly searched every single inch of that building
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   to make sure no one was left in there.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   And then we were deployed to the pile,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   and the pile is sort of ambiguous
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   because it was just such a vast, vast pile.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   I mean, it went for city blocks.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   And we were assisting in the retrieval of two Port Authority police officers
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   who were lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   They were deep down into a crevasse,
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   and they had to be physically dug out and extricated.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   So there was a couple hundred, few hundred guys involved
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   in that process of bringing in equipment,
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   jaws of life, airbags to lift steel,
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   just to cut pieces of steel.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640]   It was just a huge operation.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   And we were back toward the logistics end of it,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   shuttling in gear and bringing in stretchers,
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   bringing in oxygen, you know, whatever was needed.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   And you were trying to climb over this jagged pile of debris.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   It wasn't like you just walked 100 feet on a street with something.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   You were trying to climb over this I-beam and then down into this hole
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   and then back up that hole.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   I mean, just to run one piece of equipment took a half an hour
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   to get 100 feet, 200 feet.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   Mind you, some of these pieces of equipment are 100 pounds.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   A generator for a Hurst tools is a massive motor on a frame.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   Unstable ground.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   Unstable ground, just horrible conditions.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   Fires were still burning aside you, beneath you.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   And at one point, I kind of veered off to the side
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   and I was with this other fireman from my father's old ladder company, 172.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.640]   And it was strange because we were down quite a bit down,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   like 70 feet down into this ravine of debris.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   And he says, "Brother, what do you hear?"
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   And at the time, it was like dust.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   It was like sand just falling down a pile
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   and it was hissing from gas pipes and water pipes.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   And I said, "I hear the gas lines. I hear the sand. I hear the concrete."
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   He goes, "No, no. What else do you hear?"
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   And just beside of us was a lady's pocketbook and a high-heeled shoe
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   and someone's sneaker with nobody with it.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   And I said, "I don't know. I don't hear anything."
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   He says, "Me neither." He goes, "No one's coming out of here."
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   And I said, "No, no, no. There's got to be someone coming out of here.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   I mean, there's thousands of people in here and they're coming out."
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   He says, "Brother, we would hear them calling for help. They're gone."
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   And I still at that point thought there was a chance.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.640]   And after about the fourth day, they just said, "This is a recovery now.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   There's no more life. There's no more chance."
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   And on that first night, we went full tilt to my crew, my specific crew of 12, 15 guys.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.640]   Four in the morning, we just couldn't breathe anymore.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   We couldn't see. We were caked just with--
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   It was like if you took flour and just kept dousing yourself.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   And the lieutenant just said, "Look, guys, we're going to go back.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   We're going to get some medical aid, and then we'll come back in a few hours."
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   And we took a city bus back through the battery tunnel.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   And unbeknownst to us, that morning, this off-duty firefighter, Stephen Siller,
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   from Squad Company One, he raced down there with his pickup.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   And he couldn't go any further because the traffic was stopped up
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   because they had a report of a bomb.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   So everything was held up.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   And he grabbed his fire gear, and he put it on.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   Stuff weighs about 60 pounds.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   And he ran through the tunnel, two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   Fire truck was coming in from the other way.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   He hopped on the back, got him up to West Street, jumped off,
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.640]   tried to look for his company, where they were.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   And he was never seen again.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   He just ran through the tunnel.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   And he got there to help his team.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   It's all about the team.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   It's all about the guy right next to you.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   And he's the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, Stephen.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   His brother, Frank, decided in his name, in perpetuity, he's got a fund
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   that now builds a home for every Gold Star family,
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   for every seriously battle-wounded warrior,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.640]   for every seriously wounded first responder
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   or killed in a light and duty first responder.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   If they had a home, they'll pay the mortgage.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   If they didn't have a home, they give them a home.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   And especially if it's a severely battle-wounded,
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   they give them a smart home because these poor guys come home with no limbs.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   And so the beauty of Stephen and his selfless act
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   was that he's now helped thousands and thousands of people.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   I mean, the Tunnel to Towers is incredible.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   That's part of our mission is to bring awareness to these great people
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   at Tunnel to Towers, what they do.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   They've raised $250 million to help protect the protectors,
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   to rescue the rescuers in what's become, unfortunately,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   a somewhat ungrateful society.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   But they will not forget these great guys.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   So you tell Stephen's story.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   He's one of the 20 people that you talk about
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   in the new Iron Labs 20 for 20 podcast series.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   If you could just linger on his story a little longer,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   what does that tell you about the human spirit,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   that this guy, you know, the Tunnel couldn't drive through,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   so he just puts on that heavy pack and runs?
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   What do you make of that?
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   That shows the depth of a man's soul.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   He didn't have to do that.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   He could have turned around and went home to his family,
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   and nobody would have shamed him.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   But he's one of those beautiful, brave people that take a job
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   that really doesn't pay a lot of money,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   and you become a cop or a firefighter or a nurse or an EMT
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   or a medic or a soldier or a marine, an airman, sailor.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   When you take these jobs, you don't do it for fanfare.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   You definitely don't do it for money.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   Those 13 brave souls we lost a week or two ago in Afghanistan,
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.640]   they're brand-new soldiers and marines.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   They make $22,000 an hour, but they don't work 40 hours a week.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   They work 80.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   They work 90 hours a week, so they're making about $6 an hour.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   And you know what?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   They sign up, and firefighters and cops and medics and EMTs,
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   nurses, emergency room doctors,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   they don't really make a lot of money.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   I mean, they're starting salary right now for a New York cop.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   I was a New York cop for two years first.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   I made $12.25 an hour back in 1989 to get shot at during the crack wars.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   If you made $11 an hour with a family of four,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   you were entitled to welfare back then.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   So I was just above the welfare level, risking my life.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   And these are the guys that are getting ripped up now, right?
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   And look, I won't get into any politics,
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   but that says something about someone's soul,
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   that they're willing to take a job like that and now get zero respect.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   So a guy like Steven, what that shows is the depth of that man's soul
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   and courage and determination.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   It's hard to be selfless in this world anymore,
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   but I still know a lot of selfless people that just put on equipment every day,
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   bulletproof vests, fire bunker gear, stethoscopes,
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   flak jackets, military helmets, and they go in and they do it smiling.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   That young Marine that passed last week,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   she was photographed and quoted as saying,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   "I had my dream job," as she was holding a little Afghani baby.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   And she was dead a few days later.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   She was so thrilled to be making $7 an hour helping people.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   Isn't that huge?
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   That to me says that's a true sign of character right there.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   And it's important for our society to elevate those people as heroes.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   Let me ask you about firefighting.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   What do you think it means to be a great firefighter and a great man,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   a great human being in a situation like you were in in 9/11?
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   That's kind of a broad term.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   You can go to different firehouses,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   and they might have a different definition of what they consider a great firefighter.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   But I think in the industry as a whole,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   if you're willing to put everyone else before you, especially your team,
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   as we say, there ain't no I in team, right?
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.640]   It's T-E-I-M, and there's no I in there.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   It's all about those guys and girls next to you.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   If you can do that, that makes you pretty great.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   You put everything else second, and you just run in,
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   and you run in with that team for strangers.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   I've had the honor of--I spent almost 25 years of my adult life
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   serving humanity, my country, my former city,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   and the people I worked with were giants.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   And I don't mean that in height, but I mean that in spirit and in soul.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   I saw some of the most heroic, selfless acts.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   And then I saw some of the behind-the-scenes that were so impressive.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   We'd go to a fire around Christmas, and a family would lose everything.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   And even when I was a cop, same thing.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   You'd come back either to the police precinct or the firehouse or the EMS station,
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   and someone would put together a collection and say,
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   "Hey, guys, hey, Lex, 50 bucks a man.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   The Smiths down the street just lost everything.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   We're going to go get some presents for the kids and some turkeys."
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   And not one of those guys questioned that.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   And they were making $12, $25 an hour, and they still came up with 50 bucks
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.640]   for that family.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   But see, that's the stuff the press won't show you.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   They don't want to show that humanity, that soft edge.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   See, when you're a warrior, you need to have this rough shield,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   this rough exterior, because if you don't, you die.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   But a true great firefighter or responder or cop or military personnel,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   they have that rough exterior with that soft underbelly, that heart, right?
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   It's there.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   And that's, to me, the true great ones.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   Some of them, they just have a hard time doing that.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   There's no shame in showing your soft side.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   Well, you got your dad to say, "I love you," back.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   No, that's right. That was huge, man.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   That took me 22 years, Lex.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.640]   So you were a firefighter for 21, almost 22 years.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   Why did you become a firefighter?
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Oh, my dad.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   I mean, I was 5 years old, and I went to his firehouse,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   and there was these--at the time, they looked like giants to me,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   with mustaches, and the trucks smelled like smoke,
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   and the gear smelled like smoke, and the tires, and the diesel fuel.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   And I was like, "Ugh, this is what I'm going to do."
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   And then they bring you in the kitchen,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   and they stuff you with ice cream and cake, and everything.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   And then I go home to my mom, shaking with a sugar cone,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   and she's mad at my dad.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   But yeah, it was just--I was like, "I got to do this."
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   It was like--they were like a baseball team in a garage
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   with a truck and these big tools and big coats and helmets,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   and they were just laughing and having fun.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   And I'm like, "Yeah, man, I'm doing this."
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   And I knew. I was obsessed with it.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   I mean, I was so pissed that the fireman's test came out when I was 14,
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   and I couldn't take it. You had to be 18.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   And it was done, the test was graded and whatever.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   So my dad--now there's a copy circulating because it's old now.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   And he goes, "Yeah, yeah, this is what you're in for."
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   And I took it, and I did it like it was real, and I got a 99.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   I was so pissed. I said, "I want to get hired."
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   He goes, "You can't. You're 14."
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   But I just wanted to do it so bad, and I just wanted to help people.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.640]   I just wanted to be like my dad.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   He'd come home smiling, as tired as he was,
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   and he fought fires in the '60s and '70s when the city was burning.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   And he's still as exhausted as he was. He'd still be smiling.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   I wanted to smile at work, and I used to.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   I got paid to laugh and joke.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   I got paid to cry sometimes.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   But, man, we laughed a lot.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   It was the chop-breaking. It's just unending, and it's great.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   In your mind, can you tell me--
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   you were really kind enough to give me one of these shirts with "114."
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   Can you tell me the story of "114," of Tally Ho?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   I wear proudly. I served eight years in that command,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   and I didn't finish my career there.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   I passed the lieutenant's test, and once you do, you have to leave.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.640]   The story behind Tally Ho is, back in World War II,
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   there was this gentleman named Bad Jack Carroll.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   Jack was an airborne ranger,
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   and my father-in-law was also on the department, and he knew Jack.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   And Jack came home.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   Jack jumped Normandy and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne,
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   and he came back, greatest generation as they all did,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   and they got jobs, and they went right to work.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   They were treated better back then, vets, right?
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   And he got on the New York City Fire Department,
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   and he got assigned a lot of 114.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   And they first got radios back then,
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   and when Jack--he would drive the truck.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   You're up there with the officer, either the lieutenant or captain,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   so if the boss is off the truck, you operate the radio for them as the driver.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   So when they called him and they'd say, "A lot of 114, respond in to 52nd Street,
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   3rd Avenue, structure fire," you're supposed to get back and say,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   "A lot of 114, 10-4," but he refused to do that.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.640]   He'd say, "A lot of 114, tally-ho," because that's what they'd yell
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   when they'd jump out the plane.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   So all these years later, it's stuck, and it's a little bit of a bragging right,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   but out of 350 engine and truck companies in the whole New York City Fire Department,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   we're pretty much the only one that's called by their nickname on the radio,
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   not their number.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   So it tweaks some guys off in other places.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   "Hey, F you, tally-ho," but it's just--yeah, it's a great, great heritage,
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   and we're really proud.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   And Shamrock was--he was Irish, and a lot of the guys back then
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   were Irish immigrants from the area, from the neighborhood,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   and they would actually take the fire truck to church on Sunday
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   and park out front, and one guy would stay in it to hear the radio
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   in case they got a call.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   So yeah, that's the proud history.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   And you said that if I wear this around New York,
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   I might get in a little bit of--
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   You might get a guy from the Bronx, "Hey, tally-ho, screw you,"
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   but it's all that good rivalry.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   We like to kid each other back and forth.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   Guys from Manhattan will say, "Yeah, you guys in Brooklyn,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   yeah, short buildings, tall stories," and we're like, "Yeah, well,
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   you guys in Manhattan, tall buildings, no stories."
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   It's all that jocular ball breaking.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   It's good stuff.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   Let me ask, I guess, a difficult question.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   If we just step back in the events of 9/11,
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   on the side of the people that flew into the towers,
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   what do you take away from that day about the nature,
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   about human nature, about good and evil?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   How did that change your view of the world?
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   I witnessed evil firsthand.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   I remember later on, well into that night,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   when we were trying to help get those police officers out,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   I remember looking up at the building, Century 21,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   the store that runs along the east side of the towers,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   and it was still there, and the debris had come down
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   right almost to the edge.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   Century 21 is this old-story department store in New York City.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.640]   And the sign was there, and it was still lit up,
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.640]   like some of the neon was broken,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   but I think some of it was actually still lit up.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   And I just looked around, and I was like,
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   "This is a war zone. We're at war."
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   And we knew we were attacked.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.640]   We heard the fighter planes.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   Back then, it wasn't the extensive communication network.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   And we had cell phones, but they were the old-school flip phones,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   and there was no news on them.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   Plus, we didn't have a signal down there anyway.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   I couldn't reach my family for like 12, 13 hours.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   And my dad had deployed down to the ferry terminal
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   to retrieve bodies.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   He was retired, but he still went.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   And they deployed him to go be basically the morgue transport guys.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   They expected to be sending hundreds and thousands of bodies
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   across on the ferry.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   And they set up these tractor trailers as a mobile morgue,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   and that never happened because there were no bodies to take.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   They were all buried.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   So I saw evil firsthand.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   I don't know how someone can inflict such revenge
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   or a vengeful act in the name of anything,
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   in the name of a religion, in the name of a cause,
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   in the name--like, what the hell?
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   Were you ever able to make sense of that,
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   why men are able to commit such acts of terror
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   in the days and the years after?
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   No, Lex, I haven't.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   My mom's from Ireland, and I still have a lot of family there.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   And my great-uncles, one of them was dragged out and shot.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   He lived, but just based on a rumor that he was in the IRA.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   And I wasn't happy to see what happened to my mom's people
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   because they were victimized and brutalized by England at that time.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   But blowing up bombs and killing innocents in the name of that,
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   it doesn't make it right.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   I couldn't justify something like that.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   I can see, you know, I was a cop, I was a soldier,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   and you never want to take life in those jobs,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   but sometimes you have to.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   But you don't do it with a vengeance,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   you don't do it with a thirst.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   You do it because it's necessary for survival.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   When you do it out of a bloodlust, out of a thirst, out of a cause,
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   that's evil, there's something wrong with you.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   I have no--I respect life to the highest level.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   I mean, life is sacred to me, it's precious, it's beyond--
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   it's not a commodity, it's a gift.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   But to take life just so randomly,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   so there's something way wrong with that person.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   And maybe I'm a conflicted soul,
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   but I would have no problem seeing someone like that put to death
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   because they do not deserve life.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   There's many children around this world
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   that are being taught to hate someone who's different than them
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   just because the person who's allegedly teaching them says so.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   I don't understand it.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   - Well, that starts with just having a basic respect
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   and appreciation of other human beings.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   And that starts with empathy.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   And one of the reasons I love this country,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   while joking that I'm Russian,
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   maybe you could say the same as you being Irish,
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   is you're actually truly an American.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   And that's why I consider myself very much an American.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   And one of the reasons I love this country is it serves as a beacon.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   I still believe it serves as a beacon of hope
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   and that empathy and love for the rest of the world,
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   that hate is not gonna get you far,
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   that love will get you a lot farther.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   And I still think sometimes it's easy to see the press,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   mainstream media, you could see social networks,
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   because you can make so much money on division,
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.640]   sometimes because it makes so much money,
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   it's easy to think we're really divided.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   I honestly don't think we are.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.640]   It's just the very surface level thing we see on Twitter.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   - You're 100% right.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   There's people out there that are maximizing
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   off this whole division, right?
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   They want us divided.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   They want people angry because it sells.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   A lot of these people that are in charge of certain organizations,
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   well, they all seem to have nice cars and nice houses
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   and nice vacations, and they're constantly trying
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   to convince everybody that we hate each other.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   To me, I'll use a fireman analogy, right?
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   It's like a little campfire,
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   and if you just let the embers flutter, they'll go out,
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.640]   but if you take a little cup of gasoline with those embers,
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.640]   it'll blow right up in your face.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.640]   And that's what a lot of these politicians
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   and a lot of these media folks are doing,
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.640]   because there's something in it for them.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   - And I think it's possible to defeat them
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   with great leaders, with great spokespeople,
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   with great human beings having a voice.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   One of the powerful things of the internet
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   is more and more people have a voice,
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   and I ultimately believe, certainly in America,
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   but in the world, the good people outnumber the assholes.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   - Oh, I agree.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   And you know, there's days when I think the assholes
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   are overrunning us, but you know what?
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   I think what the downfall of the world is
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   is ego and arrogance,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   and people that think they're better than that other guy.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   My parents raised me to be this way.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   My mom is such a sweet, gentle soul.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   She's an immigrant.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.640]   She came here at 16 years old.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   She helps everybody but herself, right?
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   She's just one of those people.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   She's sick, she's got Parkinson's.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   You'd never know it, and she's still flying around
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   to her condo complex helping everybody,
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   'cause that's what she does.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   She loves to help people, but she's been in their shoes.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   She's been poor.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   She's sick.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.640]   Her husband was sick.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.640]   She's had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   My granddad died when my mom was 10,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   and she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   and the goodness of this country.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   You know, the fire department and the police department,
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   military, taught me a lot about empathy
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   and trying to really feel for someone
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   and put yourself in their situation.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   I remember years back, I was a much younger fireman.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   I probably had five years on the job,
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   and I was sent down to the next firehouse over to fill in.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   We would get sent around randomly
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   when they needed an extra guy.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   And someone came banging on the firehouse door,
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   and in the tenement apartment next door,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   they said there was an older woman that was unconscious.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   So we dispatched ourselves, and we ran over with a medical kit,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   and it was an elderly woman laying there on the bed,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   and she was obviously not breathing.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   She was obviously in cardiac arrest,
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   and an older gentleman that was holding her hand
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.640]   just inconsolably crying,
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   and it turned out it was her husband,
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   and they were married for 65 years.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   And normally we would just respectfully ask the family members
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   to just step aside and let us do our work,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   and I realized that he wouldn't leave her side.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   So I kind of gave the crew a wink,
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   and they were doing CPR on what they had to,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   and I just let him keep holding her hand,
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.640]   and I said, "Sir, could you just come over just a little bit
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   so we can work?"
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.640]   And I held his hand as he held hers,
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   and I said, "Sir, do you have faith?"
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   And he did, and I said,
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.640]   "Would you like to pray with me for your wife?"
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   And he said, "I would like to."
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   So we said the Lord's Prayer,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   and I just asked God to protect her and bless her,
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   and I think he realized that she didn't have a chance,
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   but we still gave her that chance,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   and we got her in the ambulance,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   and maybe it was wrong to try to make it look like we could save her,
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   but you can't really not try.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   But the one beautiful moment was he thanked me,
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.640]   and he was almost okay with it at that point.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   Like he wasn't as upset, he wasn't as distraught,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   because I tried to just humanize that situation
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   of what we were trying to do.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   We were trying to do our best,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   but we also tried to be compassionate to his sadness.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   I walked away just feeling so good,
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   even though it was a tragic situation and she did pass,
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   that he came by to thank us days later,
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   and it's just heartbreaking.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   But it just happens many, many times
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   throughout the country every day.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   People get that opportunity as a responder
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   to be that last bridge to the family and the loved one,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   and you only get that opportunity once sometimes,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   and you really have to--
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   To me, it's like your moment to shine.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   You could just be very, very dismissive and very rude,
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   or you could be compassionate and just show,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   "Hey, I have a mom, I have a grandma,"
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   and just in your mind pretend that that's who you're working on
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640]   and that's who you're with.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   So that moment of compassion, that moment of empathy,
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   even if it's brief, can be the thing that saves the person
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.640]   from suffering, make the difference between suffering
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.640]   and overcoming in the face of tragedy.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   Yes, I felt that even though obviously his loss was still huge,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640]   it just made it a little more bearable
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   and tried to just take his grief down to a lower level,
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   and it made me feel--just feel really good about doing it.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   That's a powerful way to see the job of a first responder.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   Of course, you have to deal with certain aspects of the tragedy,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   but it's to provide somebody with that moment of compassion.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   Yes, and I made it a little habit because sometimes with faith
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   it's a little bit of a tricky subject.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   Every time I had someone who died, which unfortunately was many,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   many times, I would just touch their hand
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   and just say a little quick prayer and just say,
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   "Look, I hope you're moving on to a better place.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   I hope if you did have faith that it's strong as you depart,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.640]   and if you didn't have faith, I hope maybe at your last moment
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   that you found some and you just found some closure."
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   So that was just my little ritual, I think.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   I just felt it was important that that person,
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   even though they were a stranger, just had someone there,
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.640]   just sort of hoping for the best for them in their last moments.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   You mentioned cancer.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   You had a rare leukemia due to all the work that you did at Ground Zero.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   Can you maybe talk to the experience of just breathing through those days
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.640]   and what that was like, being unable to breathe,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   being overwhelmed by all of the dust in the air?
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:43.640]   Yes. The first day especially, we didn't have equipment.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   We didn't have breathing apparatus, and we were handed little 69-cent
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   hardware store dust masks, those little thin paint masks
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   that would just get sweated up and stick into your face within 30 seconds.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   So you would just--they were useless.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   What you wound up feeling like was that you swallowed a box of razor blades
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   because there was glass and there was cement, and it was just so caustic.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   I remember that night when we went back just to get some medical relief
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.640]   for the few hours.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   We were walking up the hill to the firehouse because they dropped us off
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.640]   like a block away down at Engine 201 and quarters.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   One of the older firemen, as we're walking up the block,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   we're all struggling, we're all having a hard time breathing.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.640]   I felt like I was dying, literally. It was pretty bad.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   I just remember the one guy going, "We're all dead."
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.640]   I said, "No, no, we made it, we made it."
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   He goes, "No, you don't get it, kid."
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   He said, "We just breathed in poison after poison for hours,
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   and then that went into days and then went into months."
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   He says, "We're all dead, man. This is going to take us all."
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.640]   I thought he was crazy.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   Now years later, starting in '03, '04, guys just started coming down
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   with these really rare and advanced cancers.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   It just stopped being a coincidence with the number of guys,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.640]   and they were young.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   One of the first guys, John McNamara, he was 33 or 34,
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   and he came down with colon cancer, and it took him quickly.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.640]   He was in 2005.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.640]   I kind of said to friends and family, I said,
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   "I feel like I'm running through a minefield,
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   and I wonder when I'm going to step on my mine
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.640]   because everybody is going to get sick."
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   I wasn't feeling well from 2008 on.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't right.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   In 2011, I failed my medical.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   My bloods came back horrifically wrong,
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   and they pulled me off the truck, but they strung me out for a month.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.640]   I went to doctors in the fire department.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   One of them said my spleen was engorged
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   because I was probably drinking myself to death,
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   like, as he said, most of the guys did after 9/11,
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   which was pretty wrong of him, just to stereotype and to categorize.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.640]   The guy couldn't have cared less.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   He was so crude and nasty.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   Then my one doctor, who was my doctor on the outside,
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   my blood pressure was 240 over 140.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   My spleen was about to rupture.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   She didn't even show up for my appointment,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   and I went down, passed out.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   The paramedics responded.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   She got into an argument with a paramedic for big ego
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   and basically telling him there wasn't really anything wrong,
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   and he's looking at my paperwork going, "This guy's got leukemia,"
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   and he overrode her.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   He raced me out of there down to Brooklyn Methodist.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.640]   The doctor, the charge physician, the ER physician, he says,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   "You're not leaving because you're in a bad way."
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   And I said, "What is it?"
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   He said, "I need a little while to figure it out."
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.640]   He goes, "But you probably have one of a few different types of leukemia."
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   He said, "I'll drill into your hip, take your marrow and find out."
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.640]   And he said, "But in the meantime, we'll get the swelling on the spleen down,
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.640]   some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   because my spleen was about to rupture.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   I had no blood platelets left, which is your clotter,
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   so I basically would have bled to death."
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   I found out from my team of doctors that I had about 48 hours to live,
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   and that really set me off.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.640]   I was infuriated because I was telling them for a long time that I was sick.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   The doctors failed you.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.640]   The few doctors in the beginning failed you.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   I felt very betrayed, and other guys had died.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   And I had it out with that one doctor.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   I basically told her she was fired from my case,
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   and she's a pretty politically in-charge person, and I didn't care.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   I jeopardized my job for it because it was my life,
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   and I got the sense that it didn't really matter to her.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.640]   She didn't have any empathy, as you say.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   It was exact.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   So why for her, why for a few others?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   Was there not a special care, a special compassion for, first of all, humans,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.640]   but human beings in your position, especially a firefighter, a first responder?
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   You know, Alex, I think what it is in the department,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   their title is just to get us back to duty as quickly as possible
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   when we are either injured or sick
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   because what happens then is your replacement is now in overtime.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   So you're out being paid on medical leave,
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   but then they need to replace your spot, and then that costs more money.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   So I think it just behooves them to get as many personnel back,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   and especially during the summertime, you know, they look at it like,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   "Oh, maybe you want a few extra days off to go to the beach."
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   One doctor, he tipped his hand back as if I was drinking an alcohol beverage.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   He says, "Hey, busy summer?"
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   Because I asked him to look at my spleen,
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   which was sticking out of my abdomen like a football.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   And I said, "Excuse me, sir."
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   I said, "How dare you assume that I'm abusing alcohol?"
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   Because, you know, alcohol abuse sometimes will present itself
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   as the spleen is engorged and having an issue.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   So he automatically just assumed that that was my situation.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   Wouldn't even give me an exam, and I was horrified.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   I was so angry.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   I mean, I wanted to punch this guy out, and I literally was screaming at him.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   And an executive officer came in to diffuse it and sent me to another doctor.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   And when I showed her my paperwork, she was horrified.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   She was like, "What did he say?"
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   And she said, "Oh, okay, go to your regular doctor tomorrow,"
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   who was one of the department doctors.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   And she just--it was just an indifference.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.640]   It was like, I don't know.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   I was shocked at the lack of compassion.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   But you know what?
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   That being said, I'm past it.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   You know, life moves on.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   The team of doctors--I ended up with a Methodist,
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   and my subsequent oncologist, Dr. Peter Mencel, world-class,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   just incredible human being.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   My Dr. Pete is just--I love him.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   I love him like a friend, like a big brother, like a father.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   My primary oncology care nurse, Mike Nunez, was just an incredible human being.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   And he knew I was frightened because I had to get two and a half years of chemo
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   compressed into seven days, or I was dead.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.640]   These massive bags of chemo that never stopped.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   And they burned--the minute they went into your body,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   you felt like you were burning to death from the inside out.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.640]   And when Mike came in to hook me up, he said, "Look, I have to wear a hazmat suit.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   This stuff is so caustic that if it drips, it'll burn whatever it touches."
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.640]   And I was like, "But Mike, you're going to put that in my body.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   How the hell is it not going to kill me?"
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   He says, "No, no, this is exactly what it's supposed to do.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   Trust me."
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   So when he prepped the IV tube to get it flowing,
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   it spilled onto the tube, and the tube started to smoke and burn.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   And I said, "No effing way, Mike.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   You're not putting that in me. No way, no way."
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.640]   And he goes, "Listen, let me get another one. Let me start it over."
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   And here he is wearing a hazmat suit looking at me, and I'm going, "This is insane."
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   And he goes--he looked at me, he took my hand, and he says,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.640]   "Nels, if you don't take it, you're dead."
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   He says, "You got those three kids. I'm sorry. I have no other option.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   You're dead." And I said, "All right, Mike. Okay."
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.640]   And he hooked me up.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   And you know what? It was like if you do drink alcohol
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   and you have a shot or want a strong-type spirit
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   and you start feeling that burn.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   Well, the minute he hit me in the vein,
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   it just started going up my arm, burning,
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   and then up my shoulder, across my neck,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   into my head, across the rest of my body,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   within a minute down to my feet.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   And I was writhing in pain for seven days.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   And I was praying to die.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   I was the seventh rescuer in six months
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   to come down with the rarest leukemia there is.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   There's only 500 cases in all of North America a year.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   And seven of us came down in six months.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   Two guys died during treatment.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Seven responders, police, fire.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Two guys died in the first couple days of the treatment
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   because it's so vicious--your liver, your heart, your kidneys.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   Something will fail.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   And I was praying and I was praying, but I wanted to die.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   I was in so much pain.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   And I wouldn't take a painkiller because I know people with some issues
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   don't want to go there.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   And finally on the last day, I gave in.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   I said, "Please, I can't do this anymore."
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   I was literally, like, jumping out of my skin.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   And they gave me something.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   But it had burned out my mind. It burned out my body.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   I couldn't hear. I could barely see.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.640]   It was vicious. But it worked.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   And my nurses especially, they just--
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   they were so dedicated and devoted.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   And I was not an easy patient because I was in a lot of pain.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.640]   It was bad.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   And it drove my friends, my family crazy.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   It wasn't good.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   But on that first night, I had a quick vision of all these people that I loved
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   that were dead, that died, a lot of them in the Trade Center.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   And I saw Johnny. I saw friends I grew up with.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   The last one was my mother-in-law who had passed 6 months before,
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   and she died of--she was in a coma. She had a stroke.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.640]   She had a horrible, horrible last 6 months of life.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.640]   It wasn't fair because she was so religious.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   She went to church every day, devout Catholic woman.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   And all of a sudden I see her, and she's smiling.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.640]   We used to talk a lot. It's the Irish thing.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   Like the gab, the gift of gab.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.640]   She used to call me her boyfriend because we'd sit and talk for hours
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   and talk about books and about movies and about food.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   I loved her. She was my friend.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   She'd say, "My boyfriend's here." And all of a sudden she's smiling,
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   and she goes, "Hi, my boyfriend." I says, "Dad, what are you doing?"
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   She goes, "He's not ready. He doesn't want you.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   You got to go back. You got things to do."
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   And I'm like, "No, Dad, it hurts so much. Please, please take me."
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   And she left. She goes, "No, no, not yet. I'll see you."
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   And she just faded away.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   And one of my doctors on my team, she was--
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   she had a problem with religion, and that's okay. I understand that.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   I'm not a preacher. I have a faith, but I don't preach it.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   I don't push it. I just live and let live.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   So she sent in this shrink to see me, and I was messed up from the chemo,
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.640]   but I knew what I was seeing. I knew what I was saying.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   And he was a Jewish gentleman. He was a rabbi also in a synagogue,
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   and I actually had responded in that district,
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.640]   and he knew 114 would run into Borough Park.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   "Oh, yeah, I see Tally Ho. They come down the street."
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   And he asked me to tell him the story, and I did.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   And he started laughing, and he scared me now.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   I says, "Doc, am I really crazy?" He says, "No, no."
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   He said, "I believe you, my friend."
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   He said, "We share the same God."
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   He goes, "We work in the same corporation, but in different departments."
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   And he says, "You did see your mother-in-law."
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   He says, "Your faith is that strong."
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   He said, "I've had many patients express the same sentiments."
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   He said, "So I want you to listen to her and fight and be strong."
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   And he said, "So what else do you want to talk about?"
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   I says, "Well, I don't know, Doc. Am I that messed up?"
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   He goes, "No, no." He goes, "They're paying me for an hour.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.640]   It only took 20 minutes." So we watched the Yankee game together.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   And that's the last. But it was just, again, it showed the human condition.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   Here's these two men of two totally different faiths,
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   and yet we shared that bond of faith.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   And he had empathy, and he had sympathy.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.640]   And he saw me in many other patients.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   So he just didn't assume. And he gave me a fair shake.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   And I will always be grateful to him for that.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Through any of this, the pain you had to go through with the leukemia,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   but also the days of 9/11, after, did your faith get challenged?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   You know, Lex, it was strange.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   There were times I was so angry.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   There's that range of emotions, the anger, the denial, the depression,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   the this, the that. And this is the weirdest thing.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   It was mostly I knew my career was over.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   And they retired me out of the job.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   I got sick in August, and that October they told me I was out.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   And by the time I was processed and used up my leaves
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   and whatever you want to say it was,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   I was officially retired in January of '02.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   And it was less than six months.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   And I'm there walking my dog one day, my rescued greyhound,
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   who I miss. She was such a soul.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   God, she lived to be almost 13, Katie.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   And we're walking in the snow, and I got the call I was retired.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   And I looked at her, and I'm like, "Katie, what am I going to do?"
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   And she just looked up and said, "We're going to go on a lot more walks."
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.640]   And I was so sad. I was so sad.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.640]   I was so angry because I lost my priesthood.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   I loved helping people. I really--
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640]   I would have done it for free.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   I would never tell Mayor Bloomberg that, right?
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   He's all about the buck, right?
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   But honestly, I would have been a New York City fireman.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   I would have paid them to do it.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   And I wasn't allowed anymore. That's it.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.640]   You have over 20 years, and you have cancer.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Back when my dad got sick, they'd let you hang around
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   for 10, 12 years in an office.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   But not now. Now it's all about the bottom line.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   But I was more depressed about losing a job
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.640]   than almost losing my life, like as crazy as that sounds.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   And it just--
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   - It's more than a job. I mean, it's a way of life.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   - Oh, man. Yeah.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   - It's also your family, your father.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   You're carrying torture, your father's--
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   - Oh, my friend. I love my friends.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.640]   I love--we work 24-hour shifts together.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.640]   You cook, you clean, you break each other's jobs relentlessly.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   I mean, it was--I love those guys so much.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   I mean, I hope that my kids
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.640]   and anyone that I know and care about,
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   I hope they can experience the bond of that brotherhood
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   that I experienced in my life.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   It was so--God, I would give anything to have it back.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   Just, yeah.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   - Can I ask you about New York?
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   So when I--I've--unfortunately, I've never lived in New York.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   I visit. I've always wanted to live there for a bit.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   Obviously, it's a very different experience
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   to have really lived in New York for many, many years,
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   but there's a few friends of mine that are from--
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   they got similar accent as yours--
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   - Yeah.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   - That are a little bit saddened.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   Perhaps it's temporary, but perhaps not.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   They don't seem to think so of what New York has become,
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   especially with COVID.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   It's losing some of the spirit of New York.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   Do you have that sense?
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   Do you have a hope for the city that has been so defining
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   to what is America?
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   - You know, my heart's broken.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   I had moved to New Jersey many years ago,
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   but I still have a close attachment to New York.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   My parents are still there, many, many family members,
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   and I've since now moved to Tennessee.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   I needed to go somewhere quiet.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   I wanted to heal my fractured soul,
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:43.640]   and I'm in the middle of a beautiful farming rural area
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   in Middle Tennessee,
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   and so they probably call me a sellout back in New York
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   for leaving, but it's not the same city,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   and it's sad.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   You know, I'll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing,
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   but it's a mess compared to what it was.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   And, you know, I did Broadway theater security
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   for many years,
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   and I started to see it slide,
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.640]   like with stuff that was happening,
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   like, you know, public urination and defecation
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   and just like, you know, tourists don't want to see that, right?
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.640]   I was jumped by four teenagers coming off the subway,
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.640]   and they were pissed off because I was wearing an American flag hat,
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   and I don't know.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.640]   I'm not really sure why, but it left me--
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.640]   I got out of it, okay,
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   but I was taken back.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   They were literally videoing it,
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   and the kid was just throwing shadow punches at my face
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   wanting to beat me up,
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.640]   and I finally looked him in the eyes,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   and I was like, "Oh, boy, I'm a little too old for this."
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   Body's a little broken down for chemo,
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   and I finally just said, "All right."
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   I just had enough.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   I wanted to go home.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   Just worked a 17-hour shift as a stagehand,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   and I was so taken back.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   I was so insulted.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   I'm saying, "You know, I spent my life protecting this city,
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   and now I'm getting attacked for nothing?"
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   And I just--I gave up,
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   and maybe I should have given it a little more time,
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   but it's--I don't know.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   It's turned into an angry place.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   It's turned into--
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   I think there's a lot of people
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   that aren't getting the resources they need in a sense.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.640]   There's a lot of mental illness.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   There's a lot of homelessness.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.640]   There's a lot of violent people just roaming around the streets,
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640]   and it's not good.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   It's not safe,
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   and tourists are not going to come back.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640]   Even just leading up to the COVID,
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.640]   I had some tourists saying to me, "I won't be back,"
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.640]   and now I can only imagine
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   that it's just gotten exponentially worse,
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   but I hope there's a chance it'll swing back, 'cause it is.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   It's the gateway to the world.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.640]   I mean, my grandfather came, you know, from Denmark.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   He landed in Ellis Island in the '20s,
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   you know, American success story,
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   $25 in his pocket, didn't speak the language,
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   and he made it.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   You know, he ended up dying,
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building,
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:16.640]   and he did pretty well for himself for an immigrant who was poor,
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   and my mom, my Irish mother,
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.640]   landed in the same neighborhood, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   16 years old, worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.640]   in a supermarket and finished school at night,
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.640]   married my father, the fireman,
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   and, you know, lived the American dream,
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   and it was all from New York,
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   and my father's mom was from Irish immigrants,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.640]   and they all landed in Ellis Island.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   Well, my mom didn't, 'cause it was closed at that point,
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.640]   but there's people breaking down the doors
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.640]   to come to this country, right?
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.640]   There's no one breaking down the doors to leave,
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.640]   and this is a problem I have with people
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.640]   that aren't grateful for being here,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   and this, again, it's not political.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   It's just straight down the middle fastball.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.640]   If you don't like it here, I'll show you the door.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   I'll get you the plane ticket.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   I mean, would you want to live back in Russia compared to here?
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   You might because of family ties,
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.640]   but I mean, if you had no ties to Russia,
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   or would you want to go to China right now
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   and possibly end up in a labor camp, right?
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.640]   There's people busting down the doors to get to this place.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640]   It's not perfect.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   It's got its flaws.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   It's got its blemishes, you know,
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   but it's a damn great place,
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.640]   and it's the best country in the world.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   - Yeah, and some of it, so first of all,
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.640]   I have hope for New York.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   I think that culture is very difficult to kill.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640]   I think it will persevere,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   and I think ultimately the same story with New York
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640]   as with the rest of the United States.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   It has to do with leaders,
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   and I'm always hopeful that great leaders will emerge.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   - I agree.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   - And the kind of leadership we see now
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   and the kind of conversations we have now,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   I think has to do with prosperity and comfort,
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.640]   and in the face of hardship,
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.640]   I think great leaders will emerge,
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   and I just think ultimately in the long arc of history,
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   - Well, leaders shouldn't become rich.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   They shouldn't become rich in the process, right?
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   You shouldn't go into political office
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   and then come out eating at the best steakhouse in the world.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   I mean, that's the problem with politics, right?
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say,
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.640]   "Oh, those politicians, they're all like dirty diapers.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.640]   They're full of shit, and they stink," and it's true.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.640]   I don't give a crap what party they're in.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.640]   - Yeah, greed and power.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   - We had to beg these guys,
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.640]   beg them for federal legislation
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.640]   to cover our medical bills, right?
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   There's a gentleman, John Feal, from the Feel Good Foundation.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   This guy is a lion of a man, a general,
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   but with a soft, big, great heart,
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.640]   and John is a former construction worker
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   who came to the 9/11 site the day after.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.640]   He was one of those guys cutting the steel with torches
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.640]   and craning it out of the air,
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.640]   one of those hardhats that just--
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.640]   that never got the credit and the praise
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   that we did as responders,
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   and I don't mean that as a knock to responders, right?
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   I mean, we lost 37 Port Authority police officers,
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   23 NYPD officers,
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:33.640]   about a dozen emergency medical technicians and paramedics,
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   three court officers from New York State courts,
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   and two federal agents,
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.640]   and 343 New York City firefighters.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.640]   We lost a ton of responders,
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:47.640]   but the recovery workers thankfully weren't killed
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   in that process,
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.640]   but there's hundreds of them now who are dead from illnesses
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   because they came down to recover our people
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   and the civilians and the poor lost souls
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   that were killed at work that day,
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   and John literally almost lost his foot
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   in a construction accident at the site,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   an 8,000-pound I-beam tore off half of his foot,
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   ended up with massive sepsis,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.640]   six months in the hospital,
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.640]   hundreds of thousand dollars in medical bills,
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.640]   and then no one wanted to pay him.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   So here's a guy who's gonna lose his house,
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.640]   lose his life, lose everything,
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.640]   and now the never forget, it started quick, right?
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.640]   And he went on a mission,
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.640]   formed his Feel Good Foundation,
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.640]   his last name is Feel, F-E-A-L, Feel Good Foundation,
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   and this man literally went to Washington, D.C.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   with his army, as he called it,
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   and I was honored and blessed to be with him
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640]   only a couple times.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.640]   I wish I had dedicated some more time to it,
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.640]   and what it was with John is he set out on a mission
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   to get, and initially what he did is he got funding
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.640]   to take care of responders who were in that limbo,
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.640]   who couldn't get their medical bills paid,
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.640]   who couldn't make their mortgages,
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   who couldn't make their car payments,
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   who couldn't make their childcare payments,
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   and John just took it upon his own to get donations
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.640]   and take care of you while you were suffering, right?
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   I got a call when I got out of the hospital.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640]   You okay, you need anything?
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640]   I said, who is this?
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.640]   It's John Feel.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   I said, aren't you that constructor?
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.640]   Yeah, you need anything?
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.640]   I'm pretty good right now.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.640]   I said, I appreciate it.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.640]   Phone ring again a few weeks later.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   Hey, it's John Feel, you need anything?
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.640]   I'm like, this guy's incredible,
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   but there's people who needed stuff,
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.640]   and he was getting it done,
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.640]   and he with his army had to chase these politicians
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640]   through the halls of Congress
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.640]   to get funding to cover the medical bills.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   I was getting sued for $125,000
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   for my month stay in a cancer ward,
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.640]   and I couldn't believe it.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   I said, well, wait a minute, I have insurance.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.640]   They're like, oh, no, no, this is terrorism related.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.640]   We don't cover that.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.640]   So usually then workers' comp
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.640]   will cover your on-duty injury or illness.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.640]   Oh, no, no, no, leukemia is not covered under that.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.640]   We don't cover that.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.640]   So then the ping pong game starts,
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   and I'm literally have people showing up,
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.640]   taking pictures of my kids in front of the house,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   and I went and grabbed the guy one day by the collar.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   I said, who the hell are you?
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640]   Sir, I'm a private investigator.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.640]   We're putting a lien on this property
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.640]   due to a nonpayment of a bill.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   I said, okay, I understand.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   Do your job.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.640]   Let me bring my kids inside.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   Take all the pictures you want.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   Don't step on my front lawn.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.640]   And I went in the house.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   I closed my room, my door, my door in my room, and I cried.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   I said, I can't believe this.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.640]   I spent my entire adult life trying to help people,
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.640]   give of myself, and I can't even get my medical bill paid.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.640]   Well, John Field got my medical bill paid.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.640]   He finally got these politicians with his team,
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.640]   firefighter Ray Pfeiffer, who has since died,
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:59.640]   fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair,
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.640]   literally at the end came out of hospice
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   to go finalize getting us this coverage.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.640]   Detective Luis Alvarez,
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.640]   who testified days before he died in front of Congress,
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:16.640]   and a bunch of other guys that were really, really sick,
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   and we had to shame these people into signing on,
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.640]   and luckily we had Jon Stewart come on
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:24.640]   and literally just hound these guys
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:27.640]   and shame them and embarrass them.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.640]   And what it all stemmed from was in 2006,
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:35.640]   the first death that was determined to be linked to 9/11,
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640]   there was others,
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.640]   but the first one that was officially linked
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.640]   was a New York City police detective
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.640]   who initially the city said he died of advanced lung disease.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.640]   His lungs were protruding out of his body,
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.640]   and he was on painkillers, and it was so bad at the end
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.640]   that the doctors said just grind him up, snort him, drink it,
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:55.640]   whatever you need to do to get instant relief.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   So when they found the talcum from the pill lining
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   in his lungs, they said, "Oh, no, this is opiate abuse.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.640]   He didn't die of lung disease."
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.640]   So they said, and the mayor was quoted as saying,
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.640]   "He is not a hero."
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.640]   Well, shame on you, Mr. Mayor.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.640]   He was a hero.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.640]   And his father, who was a retired police chief,
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.640]   married up with the Feel Good Foundation
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.640]   and Jon Stewart and Ray Pfeiffer,
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.640]   Detective Alvarez,
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.640]   and they got us all covered.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.640]   But it took so long.
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.640]   Lexi, it was so heartbreaking.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.640]   These people who were lining up, three deep, politicians,
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   three deep to catch a picture with a responder
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.640]   so they can tweet #neverforget and #lookatme
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   and "Hey, how am I doing?"
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   All that bull crap.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   But they didn't know.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.640]   They were nowhere to be freaking found.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.640]   I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms,
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.640]   running down hallways away from us, those freaking cowards.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.640]   That's cowardice.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.640]   Can I just linger on the Jon Stewart thing?
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.640]   The comedian, actor Jon Stewart,
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.640]   his testimony before Congress
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.640]   over the benefits for 9/11 first responders.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   I mean, there's a lot of important human beings in this story,
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.640]   but he has a big voice.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   Yes.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.640]   And he spoke from the heart.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.640]   What do you make of that testimony?
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   Oh, it was heartfelt.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.640]   I mean, he spoke--
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   Look, I mean, Jon was a polarizing guy, right?
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.640]   There's certain things, like over the years,
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   he was cutting edge, and I might not have agreed with all of his--
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.640]   Oh, yeah?
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.640]   Well, you know, some stuff, some not, right?
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640]   But I tell you, I found him as funny.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.640]   I enjoyed his humor.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   I would love the two of you to have a conversation.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.640]   No, but again, I love a guy where you can have a difference in opinions.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.640]   That's the beautiful thing about the Firehouse Kitchen.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.640]   I mean, it could get raucous,
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.640]   and now, I don't know, it's a little different situation.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:48.640]   But back in the day, some funny stuff.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:51.640]   But yeah, Jon literally just took his talents.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.640]   You would think he was speaking from the heart of a fireman
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   or a cop or a soldier or a Marine, you know, someone who was there.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.640]   But I think he especially got to know Ray so well,
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:11.640]   and Ray had this stack of mask cards from the funeral cards they give out.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.640]   It looks like a larger business card that's laminated.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.640]   And Ray had a stack of them he would carry around.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.640]   I think it was close to 100 cards.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.640]   And Jon saw it, and he said, "What's that?"
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640]   He says, "These are my cards."
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640]   He said, "For what?"
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.640]   He says, "For my brother's funerals."
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.640]   He was like, "Oh, my God, you've been to that many funerals?"
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   He goes, "Yeah, this is just the ones I made."
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.640]   Like, you know, and Jon, I think, was just stunned.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.640]   And Jon actually had that stack of cards after Ray passed
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   and, like, said, "Look at these.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.640]   There's going to be more of these cards."
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.640]   We have one guy a week or girl, one responder or recovery worker
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.640]   or someone who actually resided down there.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   There's more than one a week dying.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.640]   It's one a day dying on average.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.640]   And on average, two people are diagnosed with a 9/11 cancer or disease.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:14.640]   Right now, the worst part is there's autoimmune diseases flying off the graph,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   and they're not covered under the legislation.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   By the grace of God, my cancer's covered.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.640]   If my cancer comes back--I mean, I'm in remission.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.640]   It's technically incurable, but I've been blessed.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   I'm staying ahead of this stuff going on 10 years.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.640]   But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me,
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.640]   at least my wife will get my pension and be able to live her life without fear.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   But my friends who are suffering from these advanced autoimmunes,
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.640]   their wives get nothing.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.640]   Their pension dies with them.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:51.640]   And we're hoping that John and his army can shame these politicians once again
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   to have the kindness and decency to cover these autoimmunes.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   They're throwing a lot of money around at a lot of things lately,
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.640]   and this is one that they won't.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.640]   And these are lives in the balance who really need it.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:11.640]   And John had this strong line, "They did their jobs, do yours,"
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.640]   talking to the politicians.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:21.640]   It's a strong wake-up call that it's not about the Twitter or the social media
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.640]   or all that kind of stuff.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   You have a job to do, and you have to--it's that compassion
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.640]   implemented in the form of money, of helping people that were there for you
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.640]   when you needed help.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   Well, we had a guy--I mean, I might get audited out of this one.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.640]   I hope not.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   We had a congressman from out west--I won't say where--
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.640]   but he prided himself on saying he was a retired cop.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.640]   Busy cop, 22 years.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.640]   He said no on the legislation.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   I witnessed a cop who was dying get out of his wheelchair and said,
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   "Hey, brother, I got a half a million dollars in medical bills,
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.640]   and I'm a short-timer.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.640]   I got a few months to live.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.640]   Who the F is going to pay him?
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.640]   Do the right thing.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.640]   You say you're a cop, you show me you're a cop,
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.640]   and you sign that paper."
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.640]   And the guy started tearing up the congressman, and he signed it.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.640]   But he had to be freaking shamed.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.640]   And you know what he said?
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   "Well, this doesn't really confront me.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   This is pork as far as my district's concerned."
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.640]   He goes, "Oh, yeah?
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.640]   Do you know there's 10 guys from your district who came across the country
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.640]   to help us that are also dying?"
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.640]   He had no idea.
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:29.640]   He had no idea.
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.640]   And that's the sad part about it, Alex.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.640]   It's a failure in leadership.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   I mean, I think some people would vote for Mickey Mouse,
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.640]   just because if he ran.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.640]   I mean, no offense against Mickey Mouse.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.640]   I like him.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.640]   He's a good guy, right?
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   Allegedly.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.640]   Allegedly, supposedly.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.640]   We don't know.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.640]   But seriously, I look at some of the leadership sometimes and go,
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   "We're in trouble."
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:00.640]   And also, I think the way government is structured is people who are senators
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:07.640]   or people who are in Congress, they start playing a game between each other
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   and they lose track of the connection to the people, to basic humanity.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.640]   So you forget, even when you think of yourself as a cop,
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.640]   you forget what are the cops and the other people servicing the community
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.640]   actually experiencing all the troubles they're going through
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.640]   and how they can actually be helped, because you lose touch with that,
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.640]   because you're not actually living, you're not talking to them,
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.640]   you're not living among them.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.640]   I mean, that's a natural part of the system,
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.640]   but I think that's why character and great leadership is important,
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:42.640]   is you say you leave the game of Congress and you go back to the people.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.640]   I mean, that's what the country--
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   it's like the George Washington ideal, is you're not playing a game of power.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   You ultimately see yourself as somebody who's servicing,
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.640]   this country's servicing the community,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.640]   and that requires talking to the people in their time of hardship.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.640]   Well, you have some people serving in congressional districts
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.640]   don't even live in that district.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.640]   I mean, so how are they going to empathize?
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.640]   They're not even driving through there on a daily basis.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:15.640]   And, you know, again, when anything becomes lucrative
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.640]   from a financial standpoint, it blurries people's vision.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.640]   You have to take the potential of becoming rich out of politics.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.640]   Politics is public service.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   Police and fire and EMS are public service.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:38.640]   But cops and firemen and medics don't walk out of their career
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.640]   with gazillion-dollar contracts with this company and that company
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.640]   on that board of directors and this board of directors.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.640]   They walk out with a pension and that's it.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.640]   And you have to wonder the intentions of people getting into politics.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   Are they truly going into to help the human condition
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.640]   or are they trying to help their own damn condition
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.640]   with their wallet and their pocketbook?
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   And I try to lean toward the latter lately, you know,
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   with what I'm seeing out there.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   Well, some of them are the good ones
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.640]   and that's our job as a society is to elevate the good ones.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.640]   That's it.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   And that has to do with the ideals that we elevate.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   There are a number of conspiracy theories around the events of 9/11.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.640]   Do any of these hold true to you
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.640]   or do they just frustrate you, even anger you?
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:35.640]   I've been asked this by a few different people in my life.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.640]   This is my take on it, right?
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.640]   You're a man of science and a man of education, so you--
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.640]   Allegedly.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   Allegedly, but yes.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   But you're a very, very intelligent man.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.640]   And what I believe took place is this.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:58.640]   Structural steel will fail at a sustained temperature
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   And I don't know exactly how long that would have to be sustained,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.640]   but that's the temp, right?
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.640]   Diesel fuel, kerosene fuel, kerosene-based jet fuel,
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.640]   which was the ignition there,
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.640]   burns at 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   So that continued burning of that diesel, that jet fuel,
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   but kerosene-based, it's all kind of similar,
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.640]   exceeded the temperature needed for that steel
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.640]   in the structural members of the Trade Center to fail.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   In my heart of hearts, I would hate to ever think
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.640]   that somebody affiliated with our government,
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.640]   with some sort of agenda, would perpetrate that crime
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:55.640]   and that tragic just destruction of humanity and property
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.640]   for some other form of gain.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.640]   Those planes rammed into those buildings at 450 miles an hour.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.640]   They were loaded with thousands and thousands of gallons of jet fuel.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   Number 7 Trade Center had the backup
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.640]   for the emergency management system for the city,
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   and there was an emergency generator in that complex
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.640]   which had a 25,000-gallon tank of diesel fuel
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   to continually run for weeks to keep the 911 system,
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.640]   the backup system, going in the case of a catastrophic event.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.640]   Well, that tank in 7 heated up from the fire
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   that was already going on from the aircraft debris
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.640]   coming into the building.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   So once that diesel became ignited in 7,
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.640]   now you had enough temperature to fail that steel in that building.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.640]   So I would like to truly believe what I've learned
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.640]   from the minimal fire science knowledge I have from my career,
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.640]   that it was just a matter of it burned too long,
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.640]   it burned too hot, and it failed.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.640]   I mean, if you look at the way it came down,
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.640]   it came down as it was designed to
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   in the God-forbid event that it was to collapse.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   It came down pancaking upon itself.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:23.640]   If it had failed horizontally and just sprayed out side to side,
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   those buildings would have dropped for a quarter, half a mile
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.640]   up to Canal Street.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.640]   But you know, Lex--
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.640]   The fire and the destruction that could have resulted from that--
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.640]   Yeah, oh my gosh, it could have been so much worse.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.640]   I mean, you would have taken out every building
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.640]   from that point all the way up.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.640]   But in my heart, I'd like to just believe
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.640]   that it was just a fire that burned too long and too hot.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.640]   These planes cause structural damage upon impact in both buildings,
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.640]   and it was just a matter of time.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:56.640]   And then you think about it, you add all the plastics,
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.640]   the carpeting, all of the stuff that was burning on those floors,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:03.640]   you add that to that fire load,
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.640]   I think it just had enough to collapse it.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.640]   And you were in Building 7 for part of that day.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.640]   I was just after it came down as well.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   We were aside it, and we weren't in it or next to it
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.640]   when it actually did come down, but moments after we were there.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.640]   And again, I would like to believe that it just--
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.640]   it was just that that fuel was going,
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.640]   and it just took its--physics took its course, and it failed.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.640]   So physics and science aside, it's hard--
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.640]   it's both I would like to believe,
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640]   and it's hard to imagine that anybody would be so evil
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:47.640]   as to orchestrate parts of this from within the United States government.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.640]   That's very difficult for me to imagine.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.640]   You know what, though, Lex, there's people--
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.640]   and I won't elaborate, I won't get into it,
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.640]   any controversial subjects or what have you.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.640]   There's some people that don't have any problem at all
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   perpetrating any level of evil.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.640]   People like you and I who have hearts and we have depth of soul,
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.640]   we couldn't imagine it, but there's other people
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.640]   who wouldn't even be a second thought.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:17.640]   I mean, I've seen some horrific incidents in my career
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.640]   that I go home shaking my head at night going,
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.640]   "Human beings are just--they're not wired right."
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.640]   I mean, I look at animals, I love animals, I love dogs especially,
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   and I see this dog park when I train to fly airplanes now
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:34.640]   and it's something I wanted to do.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.640]   And there's a dog park across from the airport,
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.640]   and there's 60 dogs, and there's bones flying up in the air
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   and chew toys and sticks, and they're running around
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.640]   having the time of their life, right?
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.640]   And they're all getting along, and they're not hurting each other,
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   they're not violating each other, they're not canceling each other.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.640]   And I'm going, "We really need to learn from these dogs."
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.640]   Right? And I just--yeah.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.640]   I mean, sometimes it sounds crazy, but I think
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.640]   they're a better species than people.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.640]   Unless they're rabid, they don't hurt on purpose,
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.640]   they don't cut you off in traffic and throw you the middle finger.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.640]   They just don't do these acts of humanity
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.640]   that sometimes are so vicious.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.640]   - Why do you think these conspiracy theories,
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.640]   of which there's a lot, take hold?
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.640]   Why do you think so many people believe
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.640]   some version of different conspiracy theories around 9/11?
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.640]   - Well, you know, like many things in life,
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.640]   it leaves me a little conflicted.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.640]   I have to say this, I am at the point now
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.640]   I don't know who to believe anymore.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   So I could see that lending a hand to someone
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   who's already a doubter, going,
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.640]   "Oh yeah, look, exactly, that's what they're doing."
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.640]   I mean, look at this whole virus.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.640]   Who do you believe? Where did it come from?
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.640]   And if you plant that seed,
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   it's like that little campfire we were talking about earlier.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.640]   You just toss a little gas into those embers,
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640]   you got a fire now.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   I also think there's a lot of people
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.640]   with a hell of a lot of extra time on their hands.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.640]   And they're really bored.
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.640]   - And when the two are combined--
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   - Yeah, man, you know, like, look,
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.640]   I was a three job Charlie, right?
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.640]   You know, one guy used to say to me,
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   "Anything but home."
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.640]   I go, "No, I got deadlines, responsibilities."
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.640]   You know, like that's what it comes down to,
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:31.640]   is like, I mean, look, we all have our hobbies
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   and things we like and, you know, little nuances.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.640]   And that's what makes us special, we're unique.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:39.640]   Every person is a unique being.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.640]   But I also think some people just,
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   they wanna cling to something.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.640]   Like we all wanna feel accepted and belong to something.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.640]   So all of a sudden you grew up with these people
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.640]   and you all believe this fervently,
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.640]   like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, they did it.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.640]   "They took it down, they took it down."
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.640]   And now you start going, "Yeah."
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   And I think what happens is when you're in company of people
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.640]   and you start telling each other the same thing often,
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   you freaking believe it.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   I mean, if you keep telling me I got a gray head of hair,
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.640]   I'm gonna go, "You know what, I do."
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   But no, I don't.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.640]   I mean, right, I got that waving bye-bye do.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.640]   But like, but you know, I think when you start hearing something often,
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.640]   you start believing it.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.640]   But I'm not gonna doubt their intelligence,
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.640]   I'm not gonna doubt their intentions,
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.640]   but I just don't see it as being plausible.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.640]   I just, it would be too big of an operation
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:33.640]   to successfully happen.
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.640]   You know, I mean, look, there's other things that, you know,
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.640]   I won't say it on the interview there,
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.640]   but like I have my doubts with certain things, you know, that...
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.640]   I mean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.640]   'cause some of them are true.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   No, yeah.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640]   The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640]   Well, it's hard when you don't have facts, right?
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640]   Or you don't know who to trust.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640]   Sometimes when you don't have facts,
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.640]   when you don't have figures and you don't have science,
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.640]   it's hard to take someone's word on it.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.640]   You know, I had a conversation with someone a while back, right?
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:12.640]   And the guy's like a... just dedicated atheist,
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.640]   and he thinks I'm an idiot for believing in God.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.640]   And he's like, "Yo, you're one of those jerks
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.640]   who believe in creation."
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.640]   And I said, "Well, I do."
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.640]   "Well, what about the Big Bang Theory?"
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.640]   He's going on this diatribe about the science
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.640]   and the gases and the chemistry, and I'm going,
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.640]   "Dude, I barely got through high school chemistry.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.640]   Slow down."
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.640]   And he went on a tangent, and all of a sudden I stopped and went,
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.640]   "Who created the gas and the molecules
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.640]   and the stuff you're talking about and the collisions?"
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.640]   And he was furious and stormed off.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640]   And I got him.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.640]   And again, I had no facts.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.640]   I had no figure. He didn't either, but I stumped him.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.640]   But sometimes when you can't show something,
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.640]   people need to see something tangible.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.640]   They need to see it in their hand to believe it.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.640]   And that's the real hard thing about faith.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.640]   If I see it in action, people restore my faith.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.640]   And then I say to myself, "Well, there can't be that many dummies
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:11.640]   in this world if there's so many billions of us
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.640]   believing in this higher power, this higher--right?"
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.640]   And you said earlier, like, you believe most people are good,
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.640]   and I do too.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.640]   The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.640]   Right?
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640]   If it bleeds, it leads.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.640]   That's just, you know--like, think about it.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.640]   How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make?
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.640]   I didn't even know there was that many zombies.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   And it just seems like every other show is just guys, like,
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.640]   bashing each other's heads in with bats with nails in it.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.640]   And it's like, after a while, it's like, "Oh, gosh,
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.640]   you got to get a new boogeyman here," you know?
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.640]   But seriously, like--
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.640]   But meanwhile, human civilization is getting better and better.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.640]   We just like making Hollywood movies.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   We're getting better and better,
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.640]   but we're treating each other worse and worse.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.640]   You would think with all this technology
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.640]   and all the--it's like, what the hell is going on sometimes?
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.640]   Like, I really want to see the good,
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.640]   and I think maybe the level of bad that we're seeing
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.640]   was always existing.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.640]   It's just now everything is instantaneous news
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.640]   and flashes and tweets and this and this.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.640]   Like, you know--
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:16.640]   Well, with the technology we have,
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:19.640]   it's also come to the light, so you get to see all these fights.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.640]   It almost--I think that's step one of dealing with the problem
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.640]   is revealing it in its full, beautiful light.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.640]   How much of a bickering species we are.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.640]   50 years ago, a guy like me who loves to talk,
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.640]   how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.640]   to have someone listen to me and have--right?
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.640]   I love this. This is amazing.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   I think it's cool, but you didn't have that arena.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.640]   You didn't have all these things.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.640]   My grandfather Nels, God rest him, he died in 1979.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.640]   I mean, that dude didn't even want to have a checking account.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.640]   He would walk to each store, each--the phone company,
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   the gas company, this company, and pay the bill in person.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.640]   He didn't trust the bank.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.640]   And it was like, now, ATMs, this, that,
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.640]   he would be overwhelmed. He'd be just like--
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:05.640]   I mean, I love my dad, but to watch him on his iPad is comical.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:09.640]   Right? He calls my niece's boyfriend, who's a tech guy,
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.640]   Matt, if you listen, he's the greatest.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.640]   He'll have this poor guy on the phone for, like, hours.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:17.640]   Like, the second you walk in to see my father, my kids,
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:20.640]   "Hey, do me a favor, straighten out this bed."
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.640]   And it's comical because I'm looking at my dad,
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:27.640]   and I'm going, "He was born when Hitler started World War II."
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.640]   Yeah, wow.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.640]   And I'm going, "He's seen all of that."
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:33.640]   Or my wife's grandmother was born in 1900 in Czechoslovakia,
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:35.640]   and she died in 1998.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:39.640]   And I'm going, "Holy, the stuff she saw in the span of her life."
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.640]   It's just incredible.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.640]   But what troubles me sometimes is with all of these advances
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:49.640]   and all these devices, this is what I say to my kids.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:54.640]   Look up from the phone and look up, right?
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.640]   Because we don't talk anymore.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.640]   I saw a girl literally--I shouldn't say girl, guy, whatever--
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:06.640]   I saw a person literally just about walk into an open manhole cover texting.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:11.640]   And I'm going, "That's scary," because your awareness is gone.
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:16.640]   And I've been at restaurants with groups of people,
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.640]   and they're texting.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:20.640]   They're texting each other, just sitting on the other side of the table.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:23.640]   I'm like, "Put the freaking thing down and have a conversation."
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:24.640]   And that's the thing.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.640]   We've lost the art of conversation.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.640]   My wife, she has this running joke.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.640]   She goes, "Oh, there's a lot going on up there."
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:33.640]   And I'm like, "Yeah, because I really am inquisitive.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.640]   I'm excited about life.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:36.640]   I love to meet people.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.640]   I love to learn."
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.640]   And the only way you can do that is to have a conversation.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.640]   The hilarious thing about this--so you're obviously very charismatic.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.640]   You've got great stories.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.640]   You're a great human being.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.640]   Thank you.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.640]   I'm not talking to a guy who spent most of his life behind a computer
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.640]   hiding from people.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:50.640]   No, no, and I don't--
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.640]   No, no, but we're trying to bridge this.
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:53.640]   Right, but I don't mean that as a rip.
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.640]   I would never know that.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.640]   It's real.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.640]   I would never know that because you're very engaging.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:58.640]   I would not know.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.640]   Thank you.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.640]   You don't have any impediments to your social skills, your personal--
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.640]   And again, I don't mean it as a knock to you and these young--
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.640]   Well, no, but this is me trying to look up from a smartphone.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.640]   It's having these conversations, talking to people.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.640]   I think it's important.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:17.640]   I mean, some of it could be--it's always hard to know.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:21.640]   Some of it could be just you and I being old school
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:24.640]   because you grew up before the internet.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.640]   Maybe there is joy and deep human connection to be discovered
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:28.640]   inside the smartphone.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.640]   It doesn't seem that way, but because the smartphone is so new,
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.640]   maybe we just haven't figured out those things
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.640]   because there's a globalizing aspect.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:42.640]   There's an opportunity for you to connect with people from across the world
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.640]   in ways that--
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.640]   I have cousins in Ireland and England.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.640]   I love it.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.640]   I get a FaceTime or a WhatsApp and it's like, "Holy crap.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.640]   They're 3,000, 4,000 miles away and I'm having a conversation now."
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:56.640]   I used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.640]   I adored her.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:00.640]   She passed when I was 10.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:02.640]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.640]   I was 11.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:08.640]   I'd send her a letter, airmail, and I'd wait and wait.
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:13.640]   About two weeks later, this airmail letter would come back
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:16.640]   and she called me Master Nils William Jorgensen.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:18.640]   I would be so excited, "Open up that letter."
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.640]   Handwritten.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.640]   Yeah, and then I'd write her another one
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.640]   and I just couldn't wait for letters from Granny.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:30.640]   Now, it's like that's kind of faded away.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.640]   I still write letters, by the way, handwritten.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.640]   I do too.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:38.640]   The way this all came about was I wrote a letter to someone
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.640]   to say thank you for cancer research.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.640]   I'm blessed to be alive.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:44.640]   My cancer--
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.640]   That's a good starting point for any story.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.640]   I'm blessed to be alive.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.640]   My cancer was one that if I got it 15 years prior to 19--
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.640]   Excuse me, 2011, I was a dead man.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.640]   15, 20 years before, there was no drug to treat.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.640]   I was gone, going home to see him.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:04.640]   There's this wonderful gentleman that donated
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.640]   hundreds of millions of dollars to cancer research,
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:08.640]   Mr. David Koch.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:11.640]   He's since, God rest his soul, passed away.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:17.640]   He's a controversial guy, big-time business titan.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.640]   The press was just brutalizing him one day
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.640]   over something to do with his politics.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.640]   Now, I'm a union guy.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.640]   I'm proudly served in unions, still in a union.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.640]   He was not--most business guys don't like unions.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.640]   Most guys like me don't like working for $3 an hour,
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   so we like our unions.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640]   I reached out, crossed the table, so to speak,
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.640]   and I sent him a handwritten letter to thank him,
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:45.640]   to say we may not agree on everything,
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:47.640]   but I can't thank you enough.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.640]   There's this regular dude out there who is now
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.640]   living his life, watching his kids grow.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.640]   Thanks to generous people like you who believe enough
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.640]   in cancer research, you've saved my life.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.640]   Maybe--I can't say his exact dollars,
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.640]   but people like him.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.640]   And he reached back out, and his secretary said,
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:04.640]   "Oh, he'd like to talk to you on the phone."
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:06.640]   I go, "Well, he's kind of a busy guy.
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.640]   He wants to talk to me. He's a billionaire."
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640]   And he got on the phone.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.640]   He was like the greatest guy in the world.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:12.640]   Invited me up to Sloan-Kettering to dedicate
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.640]   a new cancer wing.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.640]   It was like I was hanging out with my dad.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.640]   And the sweetest man, just so kind, so empathy,
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.640]   because he was a cancer survivor.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   But now he's got the means to help people
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:32.640]   who've suffered his fate to a better place.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   And he was so real, and it was so beautiful
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.640]   just to get to know, say, "Hey, you know what?
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:39.640]   This guy is a big-time guy, but yet he's just
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.640]   a regular human like you and I.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:44.640]   You know, I'm a guy who went to night college,
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.640]   and I went to the Army, and I'm a blue-collar kind of dude.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.640]   And here's this guy who went to MIT like you,
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.640]   and he's a wildly successful billionaire, a genius.
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.640]   But yet he can sit down and mix it up with me
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.640]   and know that I was truly grateful."
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.640]   And that to me was just like one of the coolest
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640]   little relationships I've ever had.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.640]   It wasn't like we were hanging out,
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:07.640]   having barbecues together, but like, you know,
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.640]   it was just I was so touched by his decency.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.640]   - Well, the basics of the, like, cancer reveals,
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.640]   you know, it's like fundamental to the human experience
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.640]   is trauma, is tragedy.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.640]   It's like money, who gives a shit about money?
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.640]   Education, all of that is like weird new inventions.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.640]   You know, life is short.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.640]   You suffer with the various diseases,
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.640]   and that is a reminder that life is short
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.640]   and a reminder of the basic human connection.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.640]   And that's why you can bridge that gap.
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:38.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.640]   - All sparked by a handwritten letter,
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:42.640]   which just makes for a hell of a story.
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.640]   - And you know what, Lex?
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.640]   This is the commonality between us.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.640]   A guy with three jobs to a billionaire.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.640]   - Yeah.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.640]   - We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.640]   Boom, you have cancer, and you can't breathe
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.640]   for like 30 seconds.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:57.640]   - Yeah.
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.640]   - And then when your heart's just about to kick off
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.640]   and you take a breath and you go,
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.640]   "I'm sorry, what'd you say, doc?"
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.640]   You have cancer.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.640]   And it don't matter what kind.
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640]   One of my best buddies, Bobby,
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.640]   is going through right now prostate,
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.640]   and I got way too many of my buddies with cancer, right?
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.640]   My buddy, Hugh, who became a vet since his first cancer.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:18.640]   He was a fireman.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:19.640]   He's now a veterinarian, right?
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.640]   He diagnosed me, actually, over the phone, by the way.
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:25.640]   When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me,
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.640]   well, Dr. Hugh, he nailed it to the T.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:32.640]   And we talk, and the same thing
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.640]   that the dozen of my close friends that have cancer,
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.640]   the same thing we say is the fear.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.640]   So Mr. Coke and I, we shared that same sledgehammer
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.640]   to the chest and that same fear,
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:47.640]   and it didn't matter how much money he had
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.640]   and how much I didn't.
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:51.640]   And you know, it's just like the morning of the Trade Center.
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:56.640]   There was big-time brokers who went to their demise, right,
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.640]   working in these firms, God rest them.
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.640]   And there was dishwashers, excuse me,
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.640]   dishwashers up on the Windows on the World restaurant
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.640]   on 107th floor making five bucks an hour,
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.640]   and they died together.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.640]   It didn't matter.
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:13.640]   It didn't matter if you had an armored car loaded with bills.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:14.640]   You were done that day.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:18.640]   And that's, I think, where people need to humanize each other.
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.640]   Just because you're driving around in a nice car
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:24.640]   and you got your own jet and you got this and you got that
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:26.640]   don't mean nothing.
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.640]   When you're in that vulnerable spot,
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.640]   you could have more money than the U.S. Reserves,
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:37.640]   Federal Reserve, or you could have a welfare check.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:39.640]   You're going.
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.640]   I learned that in a cancer ward.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:44.640]   I had people in my ward that died on me.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:47.640]   I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:50.640]   because I was trying to--I was putting on a fake--
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.640]   I was putting on a fake like I got this, I got this.
[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:54.640]   I was so scared.
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:59.640]   But when I got past that seven days of torture
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.640]   and the days leading up to it,
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:05.640]   I'd go around and try to comfort the other cancer patients.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:07.640]   I had this one older African-American gentleman.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:10.640]   He couldn't talk because he had such advanced throat cancer.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.640]   He was my roommate for a little while, but then he got worse.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:16.640]   They had to put him by himself.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.640]   And you couldn't understand what he was saying
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.640]   because his throat was just so radiated from the radiation.
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:25.640]   But if you put your ear down to him,
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:28.640]   you could make out what he was saying.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.640]   And I'm not faulting the nurses for maybe not wanting to do that.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.640]   They're busy. They got a ton going on.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.640]   They can't spend--
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:39.640]   So if he was in need, I'd put my ear down,
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:42.640]   and I'd find out, and I'd go get it for him.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.640]   So when they moved me down the hall,
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.640]   they asked me to come down with my IV tower.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.640]   He needed me.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:59.640]   And I knew it was bad because he just--his look was gone.
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:03.640]   And I said, "Sir, what do you need?"
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.640]   And he whispered, "Call my sister. I'm going."
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:11.640]   He had only one survivor in his whole life.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:13.640]   And she was in North Carolina, and he wanted her to know
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.640]   she couldn't get up. She was elderly.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.640]   And I got the nurse, and I got on the phone,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:25.640]   and I called his sister, and I said, "Ma'am, I explained who I was."
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:29.640]   And I said, "He can't really verbalize too well right now,
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:37.640]   but he wants to say he loves you."
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.640]   And I put the phone down, and he told her he loved her,
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.640]   and he said, "I'm going home."
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   And that was it, and I hung the phone up,
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:50.640]   and I just said, "Ma'am, I'm so sorry."
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:53.640]   I said, "They'll notify you."
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:55.640]   And I stayed with him for a while, holding his hand,
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.640]   and then they wanted him to rest, and then I left.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:05.640]   And I got the tap an hour later, and they said, "I'm sorry. He's gone."
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.640]   And then there was another girl, and she was a young girl
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:12.640]   from one of the areas I worked, a young African-American girl
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:14.640]   where I used to respond.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.640]   And I didn't know her, but I knew her neighborhood.
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:20.640]   And she had what I had, but they weren't sure which one.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:24.640]   Leukemia is an elusive beast. There's 49 of them, right?
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.640]   Each one of them has got their own little nuances,
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:30.640]   their own specific treatments.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.640]   So if they don't know what you have, they don't know what to do for you.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.640]   And she refused to let him drill into her hip to take the marrow
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.640]   because it's vicious. It hurts so much.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.640]   It's like someone's boring into your hip with a wood drill,
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.640]   and it's no joke.
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:50.640]   And they asked me to try to convince her to let them do that
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.640]   or she was going to die because if they couldn't figure it out,
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.640]   it was advancing quickly.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.640]   So I talked to her, and she said, "I can't. I can't. I'm too scared."
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.640]   I said, "But are you more scared to die?"
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:06.640]   And she said, "I am." I said, "Okay. I'll stay with you.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.640]   I'll hold your hand. You squeeze it as hard as you want."
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.640]   And I said, "If you want, they'll give you like a towel or something
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.640]   to bite on or whatever." I said, "But you get that pain out,
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.640]   but you need to do this so you can get saved."
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.640]   And she said, "Okay." And they came in, and they had this huge,
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   thick needle. They just bore it into you, and she's screaming for her life.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:32.640]   And she's squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard.
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.640]   And I said, "It's okay, hon. You keep going. You keep going.
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.640]   We got it. It's just 10 more seconds, 10 more seconds."
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.640]   They got it. They figured out her treatment,
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.640]   and they got her onto her road to recovery.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:55.640]   And I spent a long time asking God, "Why do I have cancer?"
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:57.640]   But then I stopped, and I went, "Wait a minute.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:01.640]   I didn't die that day with my friends."
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:04.640]   Shame on me for asking Him why I have cancer.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:11.640]   I had 10 years after 9/11. It was such great years.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.640]   And I got to watch my little girl being born when John never got to see his son.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:19.640]   So it was all gravy after that.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.640]   And I said, "But now I know why I have my cancer,
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.640]   because I can empathize with people who have it,
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:31.640]   and I can try to be their voice when they can't talk,
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.640]   be their shield to try to take that pain,
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:41.640]   because I can understand, I can walk their walk.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:45.640]   And now I thank God for my cancer, because it's made me a better human being.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.640]   It's made me--I'm not going to lie.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.640]   It brought a lot of anger for a while, and my family suffered it.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.640]   But I really tried to go past that and heal,
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.640]   and part of living out in the country,
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:00.640]   it's very, very healing for the mind and the soul.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.640]   But I now thank God for the cancer, because it humbled me.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.640]   I didn't really need humbling.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.640]   I wasn't an arrogant, puffed-up type of person at all.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:14.640]   But maybe I was running away at myself a little bit.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:17.640]   I'm working on a TV show. I'm fine, man.
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.640]   At the time, I was 42. I got sick.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.640]   Life was cruising, man. It was great.
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:26.640]   And then all of a sudden it was like a blowout on the highway
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.640]   in the middle of the night,
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:31.640]   and you're just veering off towards the guardrail.
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:34.640]   You're reminded that you're mortal,
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:38.640]   and that's ultimately a connection to all the rest of us.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.640]   Oh, yeah. It's a good thing, though, because that's the problem, I think.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.640]   There's a lot of people running around thinking they're immortal.
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:48.640]   When you look at it, Lex, you look at the heartache
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.640]   in a lot of segments of people.
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.640]   And any time someone that's got fame and wealth and success,
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.640]   and they die tragically, a lot of times it's from substance abuse
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:04.640]   or just some horrible death.
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.640]   And I used to say to myself,
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:10.640]   "How the hell would someone with that much money and that much fame
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.640]   and this freaking mansion and I love cars.
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.640]   My son and I are just big car heads."
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.640]   I'm like, "This guy's got a collection of cars."
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:23.640]   And he overdosed because he was sad.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:25.640]   And I'm going, "How the frig are you sad?"
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:27.640]   But then I stop and I go,
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:31.640]   "Okay, because maybe he doesn't have any idea who loves him.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:34.640]   He's got a lot of people clinging on to him because of his success.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:39.640]   And he just can't fill that void."
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:42.640]   And then they fill the void with something destructive.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.640]   And I'm not bashing people that have substance abuse problems
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.640]   or alcohol problems. I don't mean it that way.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:56.640]   But what I mean is it's just sad that their level of despair is so high.
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:59.640]   On the surface, they look like they just got everything going on.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:00.640]   It's all great.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:02.640]   They're still humans. Still got to deal with the same.
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.640]   Exactly. Because they want love.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:10.640]   They want love and they can't really find it.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.640]   Well, first of all, that's true for all of us.
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   I think we're deeply lonely and looking for love.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.640]   When we find it, that's what friendship is.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:17.640]   Absolutely.
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:22.640]   And then that's true for whether you're super rich or super poor.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:23.640]   It's all the same journey.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:27.640]   My dad said all the time, "Kid, you're going to end up working with hundreds of guys
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:29.640]   and you'll love a lot of them."
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.640]   But he says, "When it's all said and done and you're all like me
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:35.640]   and if you still got two or three of them that you talk to and you'll love."
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:41.640]   And I tell you what, I have thanked the Lord more than two or three of them.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:43.640]   I have my six. I call it my six.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:46.640]   Six guys that are going to carry my coffin when I'm gone.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.640]   Because I know this cancer is going to come back.
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:51.640]   I know it. We get multiples.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:53.640]   My friend Yvette just got his second.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.640]   My friend Mike's had five of them.
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:58.640]   My other Mike has two.
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:03.640]   But I wasn't ready to accept it in 2011.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:05.640]   There was so much more to do.
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:07.640]   I was so scared.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:09.640]   I'm like, "Wow, who's going to take care of my kids?"
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:13.640]   They were little, 9, 11, and 14.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.640]   It's like, "What the hell?
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:17.640]   I have two girls and a boy in between and they're beautiful kids.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.640]   They're such good, good children."
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.640]   They're adults now.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:23.640]   But my wife's a drill sergeant.
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:25.640]   She coughs. She don't mess.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.640]   She's this big.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.640]   So you're the softie in the family.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:29.640]   I'm just kidding.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.640]   It's funny because my son said to me--
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:34.640]   My son's 21 now. He's a good kid.
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.640]   And he says to me, back when he was 12,
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.640]   he goes, "Dad, I don't want you to be offended,
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:42.640]   but I'm really scared of mom.
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.640]   I'm not really that scared of you."
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.640]   I cracked up because it's true.
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:49.640]   She's got to stand on a milk crate to reach him
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.640]   because she's tiny and he's tall.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:52.640]   But it's true.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:55.640]   But she was hard but fair but loved.
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.640]   See, this is the thing.
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:03.640]   You take any child anywhere from any background,
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:05.640]   if you love them, you nurture them,
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:06.640]   you teach them, and you guide them,
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.640]   you have a successful adult.
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.640]   And see, that's the problem in our society.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:13.640]   It's not judgmental.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.640]   I'm not judging anyone.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:19.640]   We need to try harder as parents,
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.640]   as siblings, as friends,
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.640]   but especially when we're blessed with a child.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.640]   It's like you got to put that child first.
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:32.640]   It's like being a military personal responder.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.640]   It's not about you anymore.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:35.640]   Now it's the team.
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.640]   So that little child is now the team,
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:43.640]   and your wife or your significant other.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.640]   It's not about you anymore.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.640]   And see, that's the problem is people have a hard time
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.640]   not making it about them.
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:52.640]   Like now it's really weird.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.640]   My kids are 19, 21, and 24,
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.640]   and they hardly want to hang with me
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:57.640]   because they're busy in their life.
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:59.640]   We love each other.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.640]   They're probably tired of hearing me go on
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:04.640]   and preach and whatever, but they're adults.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.640]   We did pretty much the crux of what we had to do
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:11.640]   to put them into adulthood.
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:13.640]   And I look back and I go, "Wow.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:14.640]   "I wish I didn't work so much."
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.640]   But then I say, "No, but it was okay.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:18.640]   "My wife stayed home.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.640]   "Good lessons, good," you know, just--
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:24.640]   - But ultimately, like you said, it's love.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.640]   - It is.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:30.640]   It's the common, love is the most important ingredient
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.640]   on this earth, and that's the problem
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:34.640]   that's going on right now.
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:36.640]   Like take politics out of it.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:39.640]   Take polarizing each other against each other.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:41.640]   Take all that crap out of it
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:45.640]   and just airdrop a bunch of love, right?
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.640]   Like when I worked on "Rescue Me," right,
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.640]   I loved those people so much.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:51.640]   They were such great--
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.640]   We had such a great crew, and they worked so hard.
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:54.640]   - You're a celebrity.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:55.640]   - No, no, no, not at all.
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.640]   If I was, it didn't really work out so good.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.640]   I went on to being a stagehand.
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.640]   No, I'm not pretty, but--
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.640]   And they don't want old guys waving bye-bye hairdos,
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.640]   but it was funny.
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.640]   The crew, we became really tight.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:14.640]   We had like, shoot, like 80, 90 people on a set, right?
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.640]   And you know, the first few episodes,
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.640]   everybody's trying to feel each other out
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.640]   because you work with different crews, different people.
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:25.640]   And this is going back, starting in 2004,
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.640]   so it was a different time.
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.640]   And I love to hug people
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.640]   because to me, a hug is a true expression
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.640]   of love and caring.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:37.640]   You may not know a person a long time,
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.640]   but you say, "I care about you," with a hug.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.640]   - Just a tiny tangent.
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.640]   This was in the midst of COVID when I was in Boston
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:47.640]   and it was masks, like triple masks.
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:51.640]   And I went to see Joe here
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.640]   when he's trying to convince me to move to Austin, Joe Rogan.
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:55.640]   And then the first time I see him, he's like,
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.640]   "Ah, you motherfucking big-ass hug."
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.640]   And it felt so good.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:01.640]   - People probably looked horrified.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.640]   They're hugging.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.640]   - Well, it was just him.
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.640]   - Oh, okay, I was gonna say,
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:06.640]   but if you do it in public now,
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:07.640]   it's like you committed a crime.
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.640]   - But that expression, because I was so...
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.640]   You forget how powerful that is.
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:14.640]   - Oh, I got some of my buddies.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:19.640]   I give them a huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their cheek.
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:20.640]   'Cause I love them.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:22.640]   These are my brothers, you know?
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.640]   But on this set, I swear to God,
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.640]   it got to the point, and I'm not trying to whatever,
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:29.640]   but there was people that would come up to me
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]   for the daily hug.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:33.640]   And I said, "What are you doing?"
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:34.640]   And they said, "Come on, bring it in."
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:35.640]   And I give them the hug.
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:36.640]   And they said, "You don't understand.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.640]   "It just makes me feel so good.
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.640]   "It makes me feel like you give a crap about my side."
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.640]   I really do.
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.640]   I said, "But it touched my heart
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.640]   "that people were seeking me out
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:47.640]   "to get that hug to start the day."
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:49.640]   And I remember there was a guy in Manhattan.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:51.640]   He was selling hugs for like 50 cents,
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:52.640]   and I think he got arrested, right?
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:53.640]   It was just before COVID.
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:55.640]   But I wouldn't sell them if...
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:56.640]   - You're giving them away for free.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.640]   - Well, now I got leukemia.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.640]   I'd be kind of concerned to get into COVID.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:02.640]   But I really think we need that.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:05.640]   We need hugging booths in each city or each town.
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.640]   Because there's so many people
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.640]   that just want to know someone gives a shit about them.
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.640]   And that's the problem.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.640]   It's like, that's what I love about small little towns
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.640]   like where I am now in Tennessee.
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.640]   And I'm not knocking New York.
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:21.640]   I'm not knocking big towns.
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.640]   But I guess it's easier to do in a smaller area
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.640]   because it's just not this massive humanity.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:28.640]   But they'll stop and check on you.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.640]   Like you're out in the road,
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:31.640]   and I'm cutting and cleaning or whatever.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:34.640]   Occasionally, I'll roll a lawnmower or a tractor
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:37.640]   into a ditch because I'm not a farmer too good.
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:40.640]   But it's easier to drive a fire truck in New York.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:42.640]   But they literally, "Oh, I was worried.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:43.640]   I haven't seen you."
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:44.640]   And I'm like, "No, no, I'm okay."
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.640]   But they literally like check on you.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:47.640]   They're worried about you.
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:50.640]   And I'm going, "These people hardly know me."
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.640]   But yet they're so caring.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.640]   And that's the problem.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:57.640]   That's what I love about my life.
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.640]   I spent a lot of time, especially as a young boy,
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:03.640]   a lot of time in Ireland at my grandma's farm.
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:07.640]   And my mom comes from this tiny, tiny little village.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:09.640]   She's out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.640]   And the childhood home she grew up in,
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:14.640]   still my aunt and uncle live in it still.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.640]   I just love it there so much because everyone waves.
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:18.640]   Tennessee is similar.
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:21.640]   They wave, drive by, and you're like, "Who the hell is that?"
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:22.640]   And they just wave.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.640]   But my cousin will point it out.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.640]   I'm actually third cousin, second removed by Johnny.
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.640]   Like, "Holy shoot, I'm related to everyone here."
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:33.640]   But everyone stops to say hello and, "How are you?"
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:35.640]   And I have a problem doing that because my wife goes,
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:37.640]   "People think you're crazy.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.640]   "Why are you talking to everybody?"
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:41.640]   I said, "I'll literally stop someone and say,
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:42.640]   "'How's your day going?'"
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.640]   I mean, I'll randomly on the sidewalk.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:45.640]   Then it looks a little nuts.
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:47.640]   But if I'm buying a cup of coffee.
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:49.640]   - Oh, that happens here in Austin all the time.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.640]   That's why I love it here.
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.640]   On the sidewalk randomly.
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.640]   - Yeah, no, it's just so nice.
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:55.640]   - They'll say hi to me.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:56.640]   I thought they recognized me or something.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:57.640]   They don't give a shit who you are.
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:14:58.640]   They're just being nice.
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.640]   (laughs)
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.640]   - I was on the road coming back,
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.640]   driving from my family up north down to Tennessee last week.
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.640]   I stopped in a bathroom and it was closed.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.640]   The girl was cleaning it, whatever.
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:15.640]   She's working so hard, whatever.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.640]   She goes, "Sir," she goes, "If you go down the hall,
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:18.640]   "there's a family restroom.
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:19.640]   "Feel free to use it."
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:21.640]   She didn't have to do that.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:23.640]   And I went down and I'm old.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:26.640]   You need a bathroom, you need a bathroom, right?
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:29.640]   And I walked back out and I said, "Ma'am,"
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:31.640]   I said, "I wanna thank you for being here today."
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.640]   I says, "The bathroom was immaculate."
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:36.640]   It was, it was like my army bathroom in the barracks.
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:38.640]   It was spotless, right?
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:40.640]   And I gave her $10.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:42.640]   I said, "I'd really like you to buy lunch with me today."
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:45.640]   I said, "You really didn't have to do me that favor."
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:46.640]   And she goes, "No, sir."
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.640]   I said, "No, no, I want."
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.640]   And it was like I gave her a million bucks.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:51.640]   And I say to my wife now,
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.640]   "I've been praying to be a billionaire."
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.640]   She goes, "That's a sin."
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:56.640]   I said, "No, no, you don't understand."
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.640]   Right?
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.640]   And she goes, "Oh, you're Mr., you know, Mr., you know, God."
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:00.640]   I said, "No, no, no."
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:01.640]   I said, "You're getting it wrong."
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:04.640]   I said, "I'm praying to be like a multi-gazillionaire
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:06.640]   because I wanna give all away."
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.640]   We used to have a sign in Ladder 114
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.640]   until some other rival truck company stole it, right?
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:12.640]   'Cause that's what we do.
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:14.640]   You know, you get sent to cover your district
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.640]   when you're out of fire and now your stuff's missing.
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.640]   And the old-timers had a sign that says, "I am content."
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.640]   Because if you got to Ladder 114,
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.640]   that was considered such a great place,
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:27.640]   such a great assignment, such great guys.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.640]   You had to be vetted to get there.
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:31.640]   You couldn't just randomly go.
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:32.640]   And it was a little exclusionary,
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.640]   but they wanted good guys.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.640]   And I said to myself, "That's where I am in life right now.
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.640]   I am content, but I'm restless
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:44.640]   because I wanna really do a lot more good."
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:45.640]   It's like this podcast.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:48.640]   I wanna make sure that it's not forgotten
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:51.640]   and I wanna make sure that these charities
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:54.640]   that are really, really helping people get recognized.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.640]   But I'd like to take it a step further, right?
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.640]   A friend of mine runs this foundation
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:05.640]   for young folks suffering mental illness and in crisis.
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.640]   It's for someone that we love dearly.
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.640]   And he's on a mission now to get therapy dogs
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:18.640]   for really, really mentally wounded warriors, right?
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:22.640]   A lot of these young soldiers are having a really hard time.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:24.640]   And now they could be out a while.
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:28.640]   They may have come back in country two, three years ago.
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:30.640]   Now it's just starting to set in.
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:34.640]   And there's a waiting list for thousands of therapy dogs.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:38.640]   And he said that they can't get enough of them quick enough.
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.640]   But he said, "When you see the response,
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:44.640]   the way these veterans just light up
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:45.640]   when they get these dogs,
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:49.640]   it just changes their life radically, immediately."
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:51.640]   And I said, "That's it.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.640]   God, I don't know how I'm gonna do it,
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:56.640]   but I wanna be a gazillionaire.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.640]   And I don't want any picture, photo ops, this, that.
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:02.640]   I just wanna go, 'There's a dog, there's a dog,
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:03.640]   there's a dog, there's a dog.'
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:05.640]   And then I wanna build veterans land
[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:09.640]   for these vets who just need a nice, clean place to live.
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:11.640]   So why don't we take these old army bases
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:14.640]   and Marine bases and Navy bases
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.640]   that have been shut down?
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:17.640]   They're just sitting there rotting away.
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:19.640]   I was in the army in Alabama.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:22.640]   My old Fort McClellan is three quarters vacant.
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:23.640]   It's sitting there.
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:24.640]   They just did a documentary on it.
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:27.640]   It just looks like zombie land going back to zombies.
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:30.640]   So why don't we take that and renovate it
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.640]   and say to vets who are struggling,
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.640]   "Hey guys, you're gonna live here."
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.640]   And they take the old army,
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:41.640]   the places where they had all the supplies,
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:42.640]   there's massive buildings
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:44.640]   where you could just retrofit it
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:47.640]   and make light manufacturing within two weeks.
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:49.640]   Give these guys jobs.
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:50.640]   There they live, there they work,
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:51.640]   they'll take care of it.
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:54.640]   Military guys, they teach you how to take care of stuff.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.640]   How the hell in this country
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:59.640]   should any vet come back home and be homeless?
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:02.640]   Because now they have to dedicate their lives
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.640]   for six, seven, 10, 12 years,
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.640]   five, six deployments making $7.50 an hour.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.640]   And then they spend seven years
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.640]   or they get a whopping 16 an hour.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.640]   They walk out making 35 grand.
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.640]   And now no one gives them a job.
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:19.640]   No one gives them a chance.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:22.640]   So very quickly they end up homeless
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:25.640]   by no fault of their own.
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:28.640]   And I don't know how that's even possible.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.640]   The people in this country who've given the very most
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.640]   and they're struggling, they're hurting.
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.640]   That's not fair.
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:36.640]   And my whole thing is
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:41.640]   if I can have this dream of succeeding, so to speak,
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:43.640]   I wanna try to change it.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.640]   So that's why I'm praying to be a billionaire.
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:48.640]   (laughing)
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:49.640]   - Guzzillionaire.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:50.640]   - Guzzillionaire.
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.640]   Well, my Irish mother probably wouldn't agree either
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.640]   'cause you're not supposed to, right?
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:56.640]   - Well, I'm the same with you.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:57.640]   The more money you have,
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.640]   the more you're able to help people.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.640]   - You can put smiles on people's faces.
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.640]   - I have to ask you,
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:08.640]   the US invaded Afghanistan in October, 2001
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.640]   in response to terror attacks.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:13.640]   Now, 20 years later, we still had a presence
[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:16.640]   and abruptly withdrew all troops.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.640]   What do you think about this war across the world
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:22.640]   that was sparked by this tragedy?
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:24.640]   - Whenever you do something quickly
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:28.640]   without thinking it out, thinking it through and planning,
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.640]   it doesn't succeed.
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.640]   I understand that we needed to exit.
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:36.640]   I mean, how long are we gonna stay over there?
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:41.640]   And we've lost over 7,000 of our young souls over there.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:43.640]   For sometimes people,
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:45.640]   I don't know if they're grateful for it or not, right?
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:47.640]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:49.640]   - So there's the other element,
[02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:50.640]   and sorry to interrupt.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:51.640]   - Yeah, that's okay.
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:54.640]   - One is the financial of $6 trillion.
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.640]   And that money is not just money,
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:00.640]   it's education, it's everything.
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:03.640]   It's money that could have gone towards,
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:05.640]   first of all, the first responders,
[02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:07.640]   but all the service men and women
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:09.640]   of all kinds throughout this country.
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:11.640]   And then there's the other side,
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:14.640]   which is the over 800,000 people
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:17.640]   who died in direct result of this conflict.
[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:20.640]   So not just the American side of the troops,
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:23.640]   but just people who died, those humans.
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:25.640]   And those humans,
[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:30.640]   many of them civilians,
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:32.640]   that's spreading hate,
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.640]   especially if you have leaders on the other side
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:38.640]   who frame the death of those civilians in certain ways,
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.640]   that just spreads hate throughout the world.
[02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:45.640]   And so you think about this kind of 20 year saga
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:47.640]   and think what are the ways
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:50.640]   that money could be spent better?
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:53.640]   And what was the way that we could have spread
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:56.640]   more love in the world versus hate?
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:57.640]   And you wonder.
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:59.640]   But then the other side,
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:02.640]   what is it?
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:04.640]   I'm not sure who says this line,
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:06.640]   but it's something like,
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:10.640]   we sleep at night because there's rough men
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:13.640]   out there ready to fight for you.
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:17.640]   There is some sense in which we have to make sure
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:20.640]   that there's strength coupled with the love.
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:23.640]   Otherwise, evil men
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.640]   will do evil onto the world.
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:29.640]   So it's a very difficult decision,
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:31.640]   but then you look at the final picture,
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:34.640]   and it's like, what have we gotten for the $6 trillion?
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:37.640]   What have we gotten for this 20 years?
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:40.640]   The thousands of American soldiers who died,
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:45.640]   the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died.
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:52.640]   - It's a troubling subject for me.
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:53.640]   I'm a patriot.
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.640]   I love this country.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:56.640]   I love it with my soul.
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:01.640]   And I was just about to head over to the first Iraqi war,
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:04.640]   and we went out for desert warfare training,
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:05.640]   and then it ended.
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.640]   I was at that time a combat medic
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:08.640]   assigned to an armored cavalry unit,
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:10.640]   so basically tanks driving around
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:11.640]   an armored personnel carrier,
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:15.640]   and when it gets hit, then you tend to that guy
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:17.640]   and try to save his life.
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:18.640]   I didn't want to go.
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.640]   I may sound like a coward.
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:22.640]   I did not want to go to war.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:26.640]   I would have went willingly if I was sent
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:27.640]   to defend my country.
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:29.640]   I took my oath.
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:32.640]   I didn't join the military to kill,
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:35.640]   but if necessary, I would.
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:38.640]   I'll use the analogy of cancer.
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:41.640]   If you have a cancer and you're aware of its presence
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:44.640]   and you don't annihilate those cells
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.640]   and take them out quickly,
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:50.640]   it's going to spread, and it's going to kill you.
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.640]   Those evil bastards that flew those airplanes,
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:57.640]   one of those airplanes had a little 3-year-old child in it
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:00.640]   from Ireland, where my mom's hometown.
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:02.640]   A friend of mine who's since died of a heart attack
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:05.640]   from 9/11 toxins, he found her shoe
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.640]   with human remains in it,
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.640]   and he thought someone was messing with us
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:11.640]   because we didn't know there was any kids in the building.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:14.640]   He says, "Boss, there's a baby's shoe,
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.640]   "and it looks like there's something in it,
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:17.640]   "but there's no kids in the Trade Center."
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:22.640]   I went, "The plane, it's a little girl's shoe."
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:25.640]   I can never get that shoe out of my mind.
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.640]   The evil bastards who perpetrated that
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.640]   needed to have missiles strike and rain down upon them
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:34.640]   and annihilate them like a cancer that they are.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:37.640]   What just fascinates me is they'll show videos
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.640]   of these guys flying around and pick up trucks
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:41.640]   with 50 cows on their back.
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:42.640]   It's like, "Well, wait a minute.
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.640]   "If a camera crew can get this footage,
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.640]   "you think all these freaking drones and planes
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:51.640]   "and radar-assisted systems can't just go,
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:53.640]   (whistles)
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.640]   "Goodnight, you're gone."
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.640]   So kill the cancer, kill the cells, get rid of it,
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:03.640]   get rid of it quickly, and go into remission.
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.640]   - It's an undeniable show of force
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.640]   that sends a message that gets rid of most
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.640]   of the obvious centers of terrorism.
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:18.640]   On that note, that's though, 'cause we offline mentioned
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:23.640]   a discussion with Jaco, and maybe a romanticized view
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:26.640]   and mentioning Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:29.640]   and saying we're all Brothers in Arms
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:32.640]   even when it's on the opposite side of fighting,
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:35.640]   which is more of a vision, and growing up in the Soviet Union,
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.640]   you saw about World War II, that it's all just kids
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.640]   thrown into the, kids sent to die in all sides.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:50.640]   But then presenting that to Jaco, who was in Iraq,
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:55.640]   he did not see it as Brothers in Arms,
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:00.640]   which is, his basic statement is there's evil people,
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:03.640]   and some people don't deserve the compassion.
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.640]   You give them a few chances,
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:07.640]   they don't take the chances they have to go,
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:09.640]   because they're spreading evil onto the world.
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:13.640]   And so it's not, we're not, all of us deserve a chance.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:16.640]   - Oh no, absolutely, but the difference though,
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.640]   and believe me, Jaco, I am from a way, way minor league
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.640]   compared to him, right, I mean, this man was right there
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:27.640]   in the firing line, but I can understand his analogy,
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:29.640]   'cause when you think about it, right,
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:31.640]   those young conscripts back in Germany and Russia
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:33.640]   and all the countries where they were being drafted,
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:36.640]   even our guys were being drafted and thrown into this.
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:43.640]   They were gallantly and bravely defending their country.
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:46.640]   Now, I'm sure the young Germans felt,
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.640]   well, hey, Hitler must be right, right,
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.640]   and the young Russians felt, hey, Stalin must be right,
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:54.640]   and the young Americans figured,
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.640]   hey, President Roosevelt must be right.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.640]   So they were romantically, in a sense,
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:03.640]   defending the honor of their country, of their motherland.
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.640]   The difference between those, so they did have
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.640]   that commonality, if you and I were firing
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:11.640]   across each other from France to Germany,
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.640]   or from Germany to Russia, we're just these two kids
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:17.640]   who got thrown into this, we didn't freaking ask for this,
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:21.640]   but the difference with Jaco's enemy is
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.640]   no one was attacking their country over there, right?
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:28.640]   No one was taking their country over.
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.640]   Maybe in their mind, they didn't want people
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:32.640]   trying to build their government, this and that.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:35.640]   I don't know, I don't know enough about the history there
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:38.640]   to really elaborate.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.640]   We didn't attack them.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:43.640]   And if a soldier attacks a soldier,
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:46.640]   that's an understood concept amongst warriors.
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.640]   But when a soldier attacks a civilian,
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:51.640]   now you're after a different beast,
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:54.640]   and you've written that beast off, if that makes any sense.
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.640]   - Yeah, and the enemy, I mean, as Jaco explains,
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.640]   the enemy in Iraq and just certain parts
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.640]   of the Middle East is essentially terrorists
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.640]   who don't value the lives of the civilians
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:12.640]   of their own country. - They don't.
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:16.640]   - And so it becomes like this weird guerrilla warfare/game
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:19.640]   of violence that ultimately allows them
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:21.640]   to gain more power within their country,
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:23.640]   but they don't care if they're playing
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.640]   with civilian lives as pawns.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.640]   If you have a child who dies,
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:33.640]   that's a civilian in their country,
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.640]   that could be seen as a positive for them
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.640]   because they can use that to leverage
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:40.640]   for more and more power within that country.
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:42.640]   - Absolutely. - So when you're fighting
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:44.640]   an enemy like that, that's a vicious,
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.640]   that's an evil enemy. - Absolutely.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.640]   It's like snakes are beautiful,
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.640]   but if you go pet a rattler, you're getting bit
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.640]   and you're getting dead, right? - Yeah.
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.640]   - And that's with terrorists.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.640]   You've got to cut the head of the snake off.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.640]   And I feel, no, don't commit our guys to me anymore.
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:01.640]   But what we need to do is go with tech warfare.
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.640]   If we have intel from drones or planes
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.640]   or whatever it is that so-and-so and so-and-so
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.640]   and so-and-so are driving down in that pickup
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.640]   or whatever, take it out and do it again tomorrow
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:13.640]   and tomorrow and tomorrow, and maybe they'll get
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.640]   the message after a while, oh shit,
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:17.640]   these guys aren't messing around.
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:19.640]   Instead of throwing wave after wave
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:21.640]   of our brave warriors, brave SEALs,
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:24.640]   brave special ops guys,
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:26.640]   and God bless them for what they do.
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:27.640]   I couldn't do it.
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.640]   I could not have done it.
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:33.640]   But they have to be now sitting home going,
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.640]   what the hell?
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:38.640]   My friends, my body, myself,
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:41.640]   they must feel so betrayed
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:43.640]   because they passionately went over there
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:47.640]   to cure a cancer, the cancer of terrorism.
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:50.640]   And now the cancer's back.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.640]   And I hate to say it, but I think the cancer
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.640]   is going to start running wild.
[02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:55.640]   We need to change our tactics up.
[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:57.640]   This is just my opinion.
[02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:00.640]   I can't see committing all of our guys
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:03.640]   to a continuous eternal war.
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:06.640]   But I think what we need to do is hit surgically
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:10.640]   and hit hard at that cancer that is over there.
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:13.640]   We are never going to rebuild that region.
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.640]   It's just, it's thousands of years of traditions
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.640]   that you're not going to change.
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:21.640]   It's just some people are unchangeable
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:23.640]   because they don't want to.
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:27.640]   And we have so many social problems here in our country,
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:29.640]   I think, that we need to fix first.
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:33.640]   You know, I heard this spoken in the past by many people.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:35.640]   It's like the garden theory.
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:37.640]   You have your garden with a fence around it.
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:38.640]   You tend to your garden.
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:40.640]   There may be weeds on the outside of the fence,
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:43.640]   but as long as they're not inside your garden,
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.640]   your garden will prosper.
[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:48.640]   And I know some people don't agree to that,
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:51.640]   America first and, you know, the whole take care of our own.
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:56.640]   But it's like, how are we going to take in more people now?
[02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:00.640]   And I have a human feeling for them.
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.640]   But it's almost like the lifeboat theory.
[02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:05.640]   How many people can we take into the lifeboat
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:09.640]   before the lifeboat itself sinks as the ship is going down?
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:13.640]   So if we can't take care of our own homeless vets
[02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:15.640]   and our own homeless people,
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:19.640]   and it's just going to become worse.
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:21.640]   And it doesn't make any sense.
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:24.640]   It's just like we need to just take a timeout
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:29.640]   and I think switch our tactics a little bit.
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:32.640]   And invest into helping people here at home.
[02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:34.640]   Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:38.640]   There's very few as obvious of cases
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:42.640]   as the first responders in 9/11.
[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:47.640]   One of the things that I really want to kind of talk about,
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:48.640]   at least a little bit,
[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:51.640]   we've already talked about the amazing project that you're doing,
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:56.640]   the 20 for 20 podcast that you host.
[02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.640]   We mentioned one story, Stephen Siller.
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.640]   Is there other stories,
[02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:02.640]   or maybe you can speak out at a high level,
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:04.640]   what are you hoping to tell?
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:08.640]   And all these different stories that are weaved about,
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:13.640]   that connect the tragedies and the triumphs,
[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:15.640]   the heroism of that day
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.640]   and the days and the years that followed.
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:21.640]   You know, Lex, it seems like the common few themes,
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:26.640]   the common threads are being selfless,
[02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:30.640]   helping out others even though they might be a stranger,
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:33.640]   and acts of kindness, acts of love,
[02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:36.640]   and it seems to all be weaved together with faith.
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:39.640]   They all seem to have some sort of faith.
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:43.640]   I mean, we have one gentleman, Mark Hanna,
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:46.640]   and he's a Coptic Egyptian priest,
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:48.640]   and he's an immigrant to the United States.
[02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.640]   He was a Port Authority building engineer,
[02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:55.640]   and with his crew who subsequently passed away,
[02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:56.640]   the crew did,
[02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:00.640]   he was effectively rescuing dozens of people on the upper floors,
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:03.640]   and his boss ordered him to assist an elderly gentleman
[02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:08.640]   who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out.
[02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:11.640]   And in stopping on the 21st floor,
[02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:14.640]   he figured they would just wait there for medics.
[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:18.640]   He came across Captain Patty Brown of Ladder Company 3
[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:21.640]   who told him, "No, sir, you need to evacuate."
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:24.640]   And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit about the structure
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:27.640]   because he figured, found out he was an engineer.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.640]   And Captain Patty Brown continued on to effect rescues,
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.640]   and he and his crew were killed.
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:38.640]   But Mark was able to effectively evacuate this gentleman.
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.640]   They were the two known last survivors to come out of the tower.
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:45.640]   He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:49.640]   in St. Mary's Church in East Brunswick, New Jersey.
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:51.640]   He did this for a total stranger,
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:57.640]   and he said he was inspired by his bosses who died and his friends.
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:33:59.640]   One of his best friends was an Italian man,
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:02.640]   the other man was a retired Navy SEAL, a Hispanic man.
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.640]   And they were part of this melting pot.
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.640]   And no one looked at each other that day,
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.640]   what color, what race, what belief were you.
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:11.640]   They just said, "Hey, you're a human in need. Let's go."
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:15.640]   And we have the story about John Feale
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:18.640]   and his mission to help the responders.
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:23.640]   We have a young lady, Mariah, whose birth father was on Flight 93.
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:25.640]   She had not even met him.
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:28.640]   And she had this premonition that somebody in her family
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:31.640]   was killed that day, and her adoptive mom said,
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.640]   "No, everyone's fine."
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:36.640]   Three years later, when she was legally able to find out who her dad was,
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:39.640]   she found out that her dad, Tom, was actually on that plane
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:42.640]   as part of the Let's Roll team.
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.640]   And we have a gentleman, Robert Burke, who's an actor,
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:50.640]   sweetheart of a man, he's a gentleman,
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.640]   and he's a very, very popular actor in Hollywood.
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:56.640]   He was on Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, Gossip Girls.
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.640]   And Bobby, my friend, as I call him, is a volunteer fireman now.
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:03.640]   This man doesn't need to get out of bed at 2 o'clock in the morning
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:06.640]   and help people with a stroke or a burning garage or a burning house,
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.640]   but he does because he wants to,
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.640]   because his best friend was Captain Patty Brown,
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:14.640]   and his other best friend was Father Michael Judge,
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:19.640]   who was our chaplain, who was killed literally blessing victims at the site,
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:22.640]   had just given last rites to the firefighter I mentioned earlier,
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:24.640]   Danny, who was killed.
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.640]   And Father Judge was in the lobby of the building giving a blessing,
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:29.640]   praying to God to please stop this.
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:32.640]   And he was struck by debris, and he was killed.
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:37.640]   And Bobby goes on to elaborate about Father Judge's story.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:39.640]   Father Judge used to walk the streets of New York City
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:42.640]   helping AIDS patients just with whatever they needed.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:44.640]   And he was a Franciscan friar.
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:46.640]   They wear sandals and a robe.
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:49.640]   They just live very humble lives.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:54.640]   And just a common denominator is loving each other
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:59.640]   and helping each other regardless if you know the person or not.
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:03.640]   And really when you think about it, that's how America was made.
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:05.640]   We fought for independence.
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:11.640]   Stranger fought next to stranger and fought tyranny
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:13.640]   because they wanted freedom.
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:20.640]   They wanted to be able to live, love, pray, and prosper.
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:22.640]   And they fought and died alongside of strangers.
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:25.640]   And it's sort of symbolic of what happened that day.
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:27.640]   And then strangers from around this great country
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:31.640]   just flocked in by the thousands to help.
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:34.640]   They didn't know who was in that pile, but they didn't care.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:36.640]   That was another American.
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.640]   And what I ultimately am trying to do involved in this beautiful project
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:45.640]   is spread the message of doing the right thing.
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:51.640]   Look at these examples, these brave people who didn't have to,
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:52.640]   especially the civilians.
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.640]   They weren't paid to run back in there and help person after person.
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.640]   They had no obligation.
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:02.640]   They could have just said, "Hey, man, I'm out of here," and just bolted.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.640]   But they didn't.
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:07.640]   So we're just trying to say to people,
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.640]   let's bring back that unity and that feeling of 9/12.
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:14.640]   As strange as 9/12 of a day was, it was so sad
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:19.640]   because it was the first dawn of the sun where we realized
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:24.640]   this wasn't a dream, this was real, and it's not going away.
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:26.640]   But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:31.640]   lined up along the West Side Highway with signs and American flags.
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.640]   And they were from every country and every race and every creed.
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.640]   And it didn't matter who they were, but they all shared one bond, love.
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.640]   And they were hugging and crying and thanking rescuers.
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:51.640]   And it brought the morale so high for a group of people
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:54.640]   that was so beaten down the day before.
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.640]   It just started lifting the morale and making us realize,
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.640]   you know what, people really do give a crap.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:03.640]   They really do love each other.
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.640]   And now I'm going to be honest with you,
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:07.640]   I've been doubting that a little bit lately.
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:09.640]   I still have these examples of it, you know,
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:12.640]   that lady who helped me last night with the phone.
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:15.640]   I know there's these shining little examples,
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.640]   but sometimes I think, I don't know, are we running out of them?
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:22.640]   - Well, I've got to give you some advice.
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:27.640]   There's two words that were repeated often in the days and the years
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:30.640]   after 9/11, which is never forget.
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.640]   So might I remind you to never forget about 9/12.
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.640]   I mean, those words you talked about that, you know, there's people,
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.640]   what is it, college freshmen maybe?
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:43.640]   - Yeah, they weren't even born.
[02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:44.640]   - They weren't even born.
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:47.640]   And there's people in the 20s that were too young to remember
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:50.640]   or to understand the events of that day.
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:53.640]   But I think what that day, as you're describing, means,
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:55.640]   it's not about a terrorist attack.
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:57.640]   It's about the unity that followed.
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:38:59.640]   - It was tremendous, Lex.
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:00.640]   I never felt so proud.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:02.640]   I was always proud of this country.
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:05.640]   You know, I remember my Grandpa Nails used to walk by, see a flag,
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:08.640]   or hear a Star-Spangled Banner, and he'd tear up, and I'd say,
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:09.640]   "Grant, why are you crying?"
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:11.640]   He said, "I'm not crying.
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:12.640]   It's the tears of joy.
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:14.640]   I love this country so much."
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.640]   And I just remember, like, feeling that way.
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:18.640]   I felt that way 9/10.
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:20.640]   I felt that way on 9/11.
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.640]   But then on 9/12, I was just so proud of just the people,
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:26.640]   the way they stepped up.
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:29.640]   And I just want to try to see if that can happen again,
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:32.640]   and I hope it's not necessary for us to have another tragedy
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:34.640]   to bring that about.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:36.640]   Let's do that without the tragedy.
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.640]   Let's just stop and say, "Hey, you know what?
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:42.640]   Let me listen to what this guy has to say,
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.640]   and maybe he probably won't convince me, but maybe I'll go,
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.640]   'Well, you know, I never thought of it that way.'"
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:54.640]   Stop the finger-pointing, the bickering, the tantrums, the fighting.
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:55.640]   It's just not necessary.
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:56.640]   It gets you nowhere.
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:59.640]   It's like I was 2 years old and I'd stomp around because I wanted a cookie
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:00.640]   or a piece of candy.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:02.640]   I still didn't get it.
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:05.640]   Turned blue in the face and whatever, got a swat in the rear end,
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:07.640]   but I didn't get the candy.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:09.640]   And that's what we got going on right now.
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:11.640]   Everybody's just stomping around, being a baby.
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:12.640]   Stop.
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:13.640]   Just stop.
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:14.640]   We're really lucky.
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:17.640]   Look, the country's not perfect, right?
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:19.640]   But it's damn good.
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:21.640]   It gives us all these opportunities.
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:24.640]   Like I said, no one's rushing out the gates to get out of here.
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:26.640]   They're freaking-- I got a cousin of mine.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:29.640]   I love him dearly, my cousin Tony in Ireland.
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:31.640]   And he said he's just a little older than me.
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:32.640]   He's in his 50s.
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:35.640]   He said, "Man, I should have done it.
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:36.640]   I should have went to America."
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:37.640]   My dad said, "Go to America."
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:39.640]   I went to England.
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:41.640]   And he went back to Ireland.
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:42.640]   But he's happy in Ireland.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:43.640]   It's his home.
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:46.640]   But he said, "Wow, what a place of opportunity."
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:48.640]   And I said, "It's never too late."
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:49.640]   He goes, "Yeah, but you know what?
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:50.640]   You get tied down."
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.640]   And I understand that.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:55.640]   I thank God my mom came here at 16.
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:00.640]   I thank God my grandpa got on that ship in his 20s, 27, I think,
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:02.640]   with not a nickel to rub together.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:06.640]   I thank God they did it because I don't know where else I would have ended up.
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:09.640]   There's no place else I want to be.
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:13.640]   And I thank God that there's people like you who rushed towards ground zero
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:16.640]   to help other human beings.
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:20.640]   I believe that that human spirit ultimately represents the best of this
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:22.640]   country and the best of this world.
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:27.640]   Thank you for the stories you're telling, for your perseverance in that.
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:30.640]   And thank you for welcoming me to the crew.
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:31.640]   You're very welcome.
[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:32.640]   I'm proud.
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:33.640]   We'll take you any day.
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:35.640]   You look like you could do the job just fine.
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.640]   I love lifting heavy things and doing dangerous things.
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:43.640]   So I'm proud to be part of this country and part of the telly hole now.
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:46.640]   Well, you are definitely an attribute to America,
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:48.640]   and we're glad you chose to come here.
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:50.640]   You know, Lex, it's such a beautiful place.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:52.640]   It's a beautiful melting pot.
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.640]   If we were all the same, it would be kind of a boring place, right?
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:56.640]   Yeah, kind of boring.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.640]   It really would.
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:00.640]   But it's just such a great place, and I just want to say thanks.
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:01.640]   It's an honor.
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:04.640]   It's an honor to have someone to let me sound off,
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.640]   and it'll be an even bigger honor if somebody will listen to me and just say,
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:10.640]   "Hey, let me just try to do something good today."
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.640]   And, you know, that's the tunnel to towers mantra is let us do good.
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:23.640]   And I just, you know, I got a really big credit card with God, a big balance, right?
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:27.640]   I need to pay him back a lot, and I need to pay him forward.
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:30.640]   And I'm just going to spend the rest of my days trying my best.
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.640]   I don't know where this is going to go, what it'll lead into,
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:37.640]   but I really would like to get those dogs for those vets,
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.640]   build them that village, and just keep going on from project to project
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:46.640]   and just say, "When my final day comes and I'm laying there and I say,
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.640]   'You know what? I really made the most of that second chance God gave me
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.640]   way back in 2011.'"
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.640]   I hope it's 30, 40 years from now, but even if it's 30 months from now,
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:59.640]   I'm giving it the best shot.
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:00.640]   So thank you, sir.
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:03.640]   I appreciate it, and wishing you blessings and success in your career.
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:05.640]   Keep up the good fight.
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:07.640]   And you're always welcome back to Texas.
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:08.640]   Oh, I love it.
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:13.640]   It's great food and a little hot, but I can deal with it.
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:16.640]   We don't do so good to Irish in the sun, you know?
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:18.640]   Well, the barbecue and the people are worth it.
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.640]   Oh, yeah. No, they are. They're awesome.
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:23.640]   I was down here for some storm relief a few years ago,
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:25.640]   and I tell you what, I fell in love with it.
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:27.640]   The people are great. It's a great state.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:30.640]   And yeah, I'll definitely be back again for sure.
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.640]   Thanks for talking to me, Daniel.
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:33.640]   Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:44.640]   And now let me leave you with some words from Franklin D. Roosevelt.
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.640]   "Human kindness has never weakened the stamina
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:50.640]   or softened the fiber of a free people.
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:55.640]   A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough."
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:57.640]   Thank you for listening.
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:59.640]   I hope to see you next time.
