[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Pastor John, this is a question we get almost every day via email.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Can a born-again Christian lose his or her salvation?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The answer to that question, biblically, is a resounding, clear, emphatic, joyful, glorious "no."
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   A born-again person cannot become dead, cannot be unborn again, because--
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   and I'll give some biblical thinking here, try to be as textual as possible and not just theological.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   The life that is imparted in the new birth is precisely eternal life.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   This is the testimony that God has given us eternal life.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Has given us, has given us eternal life.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And this life is in His Son, 1 John 5, 11.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   So He didn't give us temporary life, He gave us eternal life.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   We are already participating in the life of the age to come.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And then here's another crucial word.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Those whom He predestined--this is Romans 8, 30.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Those whom He predestined, He called.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And those whom He called, He justified.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And those whom He justified, He glorified.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Now, glorification is the final state of permanent salvation.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And this verse says that all the called, with nobody dropping out, are justified.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And all the justified, with nobody dropping out, are glorified.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So the question is, if you're called, you cannot lose your salvation.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And I'm going to argue that being called and being born again are identical in biblical categories.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   We will be justified, we will be glorified, because we have been called, that is, we have been born again.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   The kind of call that Paul is talking about there is the call of Lazarus by Jesus from the grave.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   "Lazarus, I know you're dead, now come out."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And the call creates the life.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And that's what happened to everybody who's a Christian.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   God's sovereign call created the life.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So that means that there's a promise attaching to the call.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And here's a couple of verses.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   1 Thessalonians 5, 23, "May the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely at the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He who calls you is faithful. He will do it."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So the logic there is, if you've been called, God is faithful, you will be kept for the last day.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Or here it is again in 1 Corinthians 1, 8, "Christ will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So now you can go back and see why in Romans 8, 30, all the called are justified and all the justified are glorified.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Because God is faithful.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   There's nothing automatic.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   A lot of people think eternal security is like a vaccination.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Like when I was six, I prayed, "God vaccinated my arm. I can't get the disease of damnation."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That's not the way it is.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Rather, it's more like entering a lifetime therapy with a doctor who says, "You are my patient.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You will do what I say, and I will get you to the end, whole in the last day."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I will make, here's Jeremiah 32, 40, this has got to be one of my favorite all-time yes to my perseverance.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I will make with them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from doing good to them,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and I will put the fear of me in their hearts that they may not turn from me.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So the new covenant that Jesus bought with His blood is a covenant of preservation.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's not just security in some mechanical way.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's preservation in an active way.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   God is active in my life.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   When I ask people, "Tony, how do you know you're going to be a Christian when you wake up in the morning?"
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   A lot of people are kind of shocked.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Like, "Oh, because, you know, it's like being human."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   No, it's not like being human.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You will wake up a Christian tomorrow morning because God is faithful.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   God will wake you up and awaken in you His faith.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And a couple more verses.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Philippians 1, 6, "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   The reason Paul talks like that is because of the way God's faithfulness connects to his call, his new birth.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   "Now unto him who is able to keep you from stumbling."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I preached on this a while back because I was at age 67, just finishing up my pastoral ministry.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I'm overwhelmed by the fact that God kept me.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   He kept me.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   He didn't let me fall down and bring reproach upon His name and destroy the church.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I don't look back on that and put my thumb in my armpits and say, "What a good boy am I."
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I say, "Amazing, amazing."
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "Now unto him who kept me and will keep me."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Which only leaves, I think, one key question that people always have and should have.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Well, what about people who are in the church?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They've been deacons or elders.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They look like they got saved in college and here they are five years later and they've thrown it all away.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And some of them die in that condition.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   What about them?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And I think there are two key verses that people should think about long and hard.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And one is 1 John 2, 19.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   "They went out from us because they were not of us.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But they went out that it may become plain that they were not all of us."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And "of us" in that verse surely means born again with us, grafted into Christ with us.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And they weren't.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   They looked like they were.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They said some of the right things.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   They had tasted of the powers of the age to come, but they were not born of God.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And one more.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You know, Hebrews 6 is a big stumbling block for people here about the kinds of spiritual experiences a person can have and still be lost.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But Hebrews 3, 14, I think, is an absolute key in the book of Hebrews where it says, "We have become sharers in Christ if we hold our firm confidence to the end."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He doesn't say, "If you hold your confidence firm to the end, you will get a share in Christ."
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   He says, "We know that we have had from the beginning of our lives with Christ a share in Christ because we endured to the end."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Which means perseverance in faith is the evidence that we've been made part of Christ.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And when that perseverance doesn't hold, then we were never in.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And the assurance, therefore—here's the key—the assurance, therefore, is not automatic.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's assurance rooted in our confidence in an absolutely sovereign, covenant-keeping God who gave his Son on behalf of sinners,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   so that as we look to him, the Holy Spirit testifies to us that we are the children of God.
