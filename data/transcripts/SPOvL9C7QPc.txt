[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   - Yeah, the very good question is, most of the time,
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.680]   we said brothers, but twice in the New Testament,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.640]   we said brethren, why?
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.720]   And it has to do with a difference in the Greek word.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.940]   The Greek word adelphoi, I argued strongly
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.040]   that let's get rid of that church word brethren, okay,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.920]   and just say brothers, and so we did that.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.560]   But then somebody says, okay, First Peter,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.520]   twice you went back to brethren.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   It's a different Greek word, that's the reason.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.240]   Adelphoi is brothers.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.840]   Then there's another word, spelled slightly different,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.840]   that has reference, we might say, to the brotherhood, okay,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.480]   and so we chose to go back to brethren
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.120]   in those two references in First Peter
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.520]   because it's a similar but a different Greek word.
