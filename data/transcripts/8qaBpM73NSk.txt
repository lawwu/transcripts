[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.840]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.680]   My guest today is Dr. Casey Means.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.920]   Dr. Casey Means did her undergraduate degree
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.440]   at Stanford University and her medical degree
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.880]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.760]   She is one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.100]   in metabolic health.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.840]   Today, we discuss how metabolic function and dysfunction
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.160]   impacts our health.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.000]   In particular, we discuss mitochondria,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   which are involved in energy production within our cells,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.040]   and the various things that we can each and all do
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.980]   to ensure proper mitochondrial function,
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680]   which is essential, not just for things
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.920]   like body composition and physical and mental energy,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.360]   but also our ability to regulate hormones,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.280]   blood sugar, and much more.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480]   We discuss how exercise, even simple exercise like walking,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.220]   as well as sleep, as well as more vigorous exercise,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.740]   and in particular, nutrition,
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.520]   including the types of foods we eat,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160]   the timing of food intake,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060]   and the sources and quality of those foods' impact
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.120]   are mitochondria and other aspects of metabolic function.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.360]   We also discuss how particular micronutrients
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.000]   within specific foods can directly impact
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.040]   mitochondrial and metabolic health.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   Dr. Means explains how mitochondria, inflammation,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.840]   and reactive oxygen species,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.320]   which are the byproducts of metabolism in our cells,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.240]   can combine to create conditions of obesity,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.660]   as well as ways that we can manage those things,
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.060]   or even reverse mitochondrial inflammation
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.460]   and reactive oxygen species dysfunction
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.860]   in order to reverse obesity, reverse diabetes,
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.060]   and enhance our health in myriad ways.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.380]   By the end of today's discussion,
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.460]   you'll have a clear picture of the cellular processes
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.140]   that occur in the brain and body
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.540]   that underlie metabolic disease and metabolic health.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.960]   And most importantly, you'll have a very clear picture
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.060]   of the actionable items that we can each and all carry out
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.700]   every day and every week in order to ensure metabolic health,
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.500]   proper mitochondrial function,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.420]   and indeed that can also impact body composition
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.660]   and overall feelings of wellbeing.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.500]   I would also like to share that Dr. Casey Means
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.380]   has a terrific new book coming out.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.280]   I know it's terrific because I've read it.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.100]   It is entitled "Good Energy,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.300]   The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.660]   and Limitless Health."
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.900]   If you're interested in the book,
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.220]   we provided a link to the book in the show note captions.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.680]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.700]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.660]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.600]   about science and science related tools
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.980]   to the general public.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.200]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.940]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.200]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.100]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.040]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.560]   and with several expert guests on this podcast
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.680]   about the fact that most of us should be seeking
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.420]   to get about one gram of quality protein
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.620]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.300]   Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.900]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.220]   but also for overall metabolism and health.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.980]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.620]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.820]   One of the key things however,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.060]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240]   without ingesting excess calories.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.300]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.060]   per calorie ratio,
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.620]   such that getting one gram of protein
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.460]   per pound of body weight is both easy
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.280]   and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.380]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.860]   They have venison steaks, they have ground venison,
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.780]   and they have venison bone broth.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.260]   I personally like all of those.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.660]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.900]   pretty much every day.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.460]   And occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.620]   And if you're really on the go,
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740]   they have Maui Nui Venison jerky,
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.660]   which has 10 grams of protein per stick
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.460]   at just 55 calories.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.320]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.940]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.700]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.560]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.160]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.300]   Now I've spoken many times before in this podcast
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.260]   about the critical need to get sleep,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.100]   both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.940]   When we do that, everything, our mental health,
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.140]   our physical health, performance in any sports
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.140]   or school, et cetera, all get better.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.260]   And when we're not sleeping well or enough,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.540]   all those things suffer.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.780]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.820]   is that your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.260]   by about one to three degrees in order to fall
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.580]   and stay deeply asleep.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.300]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.260]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.020]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.860]   One of the best ways to ensure that happens
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.620]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.540]   And with Eight Sleep, it makes it very easy to do that.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.280]   You program in the temperature that you want
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.160]   at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.480]   You can even divide the temperature
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.320]   for two different people,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.200]   if you have two different people sleeping in the bed,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.580]   and it tracks your sleep.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.880]   It tells you how much slow wave sleep
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.780]   and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.980]   It really helps you dial in the correct parameters
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.120]   to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.840]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   for well over three years now,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.220]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.520]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.320]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.480]   and save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.440]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.720]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.020]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.120]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.720]   AeroPress is like a French press,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.120]   but a French press that always brews
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.800]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.920]   AeroPress achieves this
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.080]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.800]   between the hot water and the coffee.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.460]   And that short contact time also means
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.040]   that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.080]   The whole thing takes only about three minutes.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.560]   I started using an AeroPress over 10 years ago,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.840]   and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.640]   who's a former Stanford engineer, who's also an inventor.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.620]   He developed things like the Arobi Frisbee.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.920]   In any event, I'm a big fan of Adler inventions.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.840]   And when I heard he developed a coffee maker, the AeroPress,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.040]   I tried it and I found that indeed,
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.340]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.560]   It's also extremely small and portable.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.240]   So I started using it in the laboratory
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.400]   when I travel on the road and also at home.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   And I'm not alone in my love of the AeroPress coffee maker.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.280]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,

[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.000]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.200]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Casey Means.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.960]   Dr. Casey Means, welcome.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.840]   - Dr. Andrew Huberman, thank you so much for having me.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.480]   - Really excited to talk to you today
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.140]   about all things health.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.220]   One of the things I love so much about your work
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.880]   is that you really give people a sense of agency
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.680]   through knowledge and actionable tools,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.040]   which is very near and dear to my mission and my heart.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.080]   But to kick things off,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.380]   let's talk about metabolic function and dysfunction.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.500]   I think most people hear the word metabolism
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.080]   and they think, okay, the burning of energy.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.440]   Maybe they think about ATP.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.800]   Maybe they think about calories in, calories out,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.640]   that sort of thing.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.160]   But what are we talking about
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.040]   when we're talking about metabolic function and dysfunction?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.920]   Because these are really important concepts
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.120]   for everyone to understand.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.800]   - Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.720]   I think that when we hear the word metabolism,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.760]   the first thing that comes to most people's minds
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.720]   is my weight.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.000]   Do I have a fast metabolism or do I have a slow metabolism
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.060]   or something like basal metabolic rate?
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.400]   And I think what's really important for people to realize
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.040]   is that metabolism is actually the foundation of all health.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.160]   It is the core foundational pathway
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.040]   that drives all other aspects of health.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.240]   And it's also the core foundational pathway
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.660]   that's truly getting crushed in the modern American world
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.600]   and underlying nine of the 10 leading causes of death
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840]   in the United States today.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.000]   It's really quite relevant to everyone.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And the spectrum of metabolic rooted disease is vast
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.920]   and actually really relevant to most Americans.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   The latest research
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.120]   from American College of Cardiology suggests
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   that 93% of American adults have suboptimal metabolism.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.840]   And we can go into what that means.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.000]   But fundamentally, when we're talking about metabolism,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.480]   we're talking about how we convert food energy
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.040]   to human energy.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   So we take in a astonishing 70 metric tons or so
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.880]   of food in our lifetime.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.600]   And that is potential energy.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.760]   It's energy from the environment that's outside of us
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   that through our metabolic pathways gets converted
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.760]   to a currency of energy that can then be used to pay
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.520]   for essentially every chemical reaction inside our body.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.600]   And the bubbling up of all of those chemical reactions
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.480]   is our lives.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.720]   And so when metabolism is not working properly,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.440]   it's essentially creating underpowered cells.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.720]   And like any city or factory or machine,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   not having adequate power will lead to dysfunction.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.480]   And the reason that the metabolic spectrum of disease
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.800]   is so vast is because we have over 200 cell types
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   in the body and underpowering in different cell types
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.920]   is going to look like different symptoms
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.440]   because underpowering in a astrocyte
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.000]   is gonna look different than underpowering
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.680]   an ovarian theca cell or an endothelial cell.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.080]   It's going to look different,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   but the core foundational process that is dysfunctional
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   can actually be the same.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.080]   And I think the biggest blind spot in Western healthcare
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.240]   and actually the reason that health outcomes
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.000]   are actually getting worse every year in the United States
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.480]   is because fundamentally we are ignoring metabolic health
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.320]   and metabolic dysfunction.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   We are laser focused on the downstream symptoms
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.400]   that result from metabolic dysfunction
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.040]   in different cell types.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   And we spend all of our energy focusing on those symptoms,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.900]   playing whack-a-mole with them,
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.880]   and really ignoring that underlying foundational root cause
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.800]   of metabolic function.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.160]   And what's so fascinating to me
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.940]   and what I saw in the healthcare system
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.600]   as like a super subspecialist, as an ENT surgeon,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   is that the more we specialize in healthcare,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.120]   we have over a hundred specialties now
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.920]   that we've just like invented in the healthcare system.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.380]   The more we specialize in healthcare,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   the sicker we're actually getting.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.340]   So the more we do technological innovation
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.280]   in all these different specialties,
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.360]   the sicker we're getting.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.460]   And I think what the real nugget there
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.720]   that everyone really needs to understand
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.440]   is we've bought into a system where we value specialization
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.040]   and this is the game in Western medicine.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.360]   But while we've done that, what has happened
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.120]   is we have the worst chronic disease epidemic
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   and the lowest life expectancy
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.600]   of any high-income country in the world.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.460]   And the reason is because in that specialization,
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.080]   we're focused on the downstream manifestation
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.400]   of underpowering of cells, the cell-specific symptoms
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   and not the metabolic function itself.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.840]   So really our chronic disease epidemic in this country,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.880]   it is a metabolic dysfunction epidemic,
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   an underpowering epidemic.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.440]   And that is the biggest blind spot in healthcare.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   And I think a focus on metabolic function
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.320]   as the center of our healthcare system,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.340]   it's a completely new paradigm for health
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.580]   that is urgently, and I cannot overstate enough,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.500]   it's urgently needed.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.940]   We know we're not in the right paradigm right now
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.440]   when we have 100 isolated specialties
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.660]   and yet 85 to 90% of the conditions in those specialties,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.260]   if you go to the science and look at the real physiology
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.560]   is metabolic dysfunction.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.540]   So that's kind of the landscape
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.260]   of what metabolic dysfunction is
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.420]   and how it's kind of creating a big blind spot
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.740]   in the healthcare system that really represents
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.740]   an outdated way of categorizing disease
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.820]   that unfortunately is killing us, I would say.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.840]   - Yeah, thank you for that.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.300]   I have several reflections and a question.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.580]   First off, the analogy that comes to mind
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.600]   is an assembly line that's constructing,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.100]   let's say an automobile,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.180]   and it sounds like 80 to 90% of the automobiles
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.900]   that are coming off that assembly line are not working well.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.020]   Tires aren't aligned, engines isn't working well,
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.740]   transmission isn't working, has a bunch of issues.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.740]   And no factory, no car manufacturer would tolerate that
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.900]   nor would the customers,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.860]   but we're tolerating that in ourselves,
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.980]   it sounds like, many people are.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.020]   And then accepting the fact that then a bunch of
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.520]   other businesses are gonna crop up,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.160]   like the business that aligns the tires,
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.240]   the business that goes and repairs the pistons.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.160]   And essentially, when you talk about these multi specialties
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.800]   that have evolved in the medical care system,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.680]   they provide an opportunity to go and fix the problems
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.000]   or try and ameliorate the problems.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.840]   But really what we need to do to make this analogy
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.360]   much briefer than it otherwise would be
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.840]   is just to go further up the assembly line,
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.120]   figure out whether or not the hardware is correct,
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.160]   the software is correct,
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.120]   and where the hardware and software are becoming deficient
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.580]   in this analogy where we are the automobile
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.720]   that's essentially coming off the conveyor broken.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.960]   And the good news is, and I know this
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.160]   because I've read your book
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.860]   and because I follow your work very closely.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.400]   The good news is that we each and all can take matters
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.280]   to some extent into our own hands,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.560]   collaborate with healthcare providers
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.080]   and repair metabolic dysfunction,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.160]   essentially make us metabolically functional.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.600]   So the question therefore is,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   I think most people when they hear metabolism,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.160]   they think energy.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   And when we hear energy, we think ATP sometimes,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.000]   but typically people think about mitochondria,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.060]   the powerhouse of the cell, so to speak.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.760]   So you've talked about the trifecta or the big three,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.000]   mitochondria, inflammation, and oxidative stress
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.180]   as three critical factors underlying metabolic dysfunction.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.320]   And I'm presuming those are also the avenues to address
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.980]   in order to create metabolic function.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.560]   Because ultimately what we want, of course,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.600]   is an optimistic picture
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.640]   that we can actually take some control,
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.300]   that we have some agency in all of this,
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.140]   which I believe we do.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.300]   So if you would, could you get us all on the same page
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.400]   about what are mitochondria and what do they do?
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.480]   Why are they so important?
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.600]   Then we can turn to inflammation and oxidative stress.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.800]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.560]   So the mitochondria are the structure within the cells.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.080]   We have 40 trillion cells,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.760]   and each cell might have a handful
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.640]   or many thousand mitochondria.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.380]   And they are the magical part of the cell
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   that does that conversion process of food breaking down
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.840]   and then converting to energy,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.520]   translating it to a currency of energy
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.280]   our body can recognize.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.080]   And so currently what's happening
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.320]   is that our environment,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.640]   the environment that our cells exist in
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   across every single facet of our life
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.260]   over the past 50 to 75 years has changed rapidly.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.600]   You look at how our food system has changed
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.920]   from whole real food and good soil to industrial food.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.360]   Our sleep habits have changed.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.280]   We're sleeping less.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.400]   It's very fragmented.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.600]   Our movement patterns have changed.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.140]   We're sitting 80% of the waking day.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.280]   Our time in nature has changed.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.600]   We actually are indoors as Americans,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   93% of a 24-hour period.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.800]   So that totally changed our relationship with light.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   We have 80,000 synthetic toxins in our food, water, air,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.020]   personal care products, home care products.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.840]   We live a thermoneutral existence now with our thermostats.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.420]   There's no real swings in temperature
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.640]   unless you're intentionally trying to.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.920]   And then our emotional health is very different.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.840]   We are very much exposed
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   to low-grade chronic stress triggers.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.000]   So across food, sleep, movement, emotional health,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.040]   toxins, light, and temperature,
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.560]   things are not what they once were.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.060]   And it's changed in the blink of an eye.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.720]   I mean, the light bulb was created in 1806.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   This is like 0.04% of human history
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.840]   that we've even had artificial light.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.040]   So things have changed.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.280]   And the unique thing
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.960]   about all of these changes in our environment
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.040]   is that each one of those pillars,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   each of those changes in our environment
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.400]   synergistically directly hurts the mitochondria
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.960]   through different mechanisms, the chronic low-grade stress,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.280]   the sitting, the ultra-processed nutrient-devoid food,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.360]   even the blue light at nighttime,
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.160]   all of it through different core biologic mechanisms
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.680]   synergistically hits this part of the cell, the mitochondria.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.080]   So we have the food coming in,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.460]   but we're not doing a good job of converting it
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.960]   to an energy form we can use.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.440]   So we have these underpowered dysfunctional cells
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.920]   because of mitochondrial dysfunction
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.740]   caused by our environment.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.440]   And of course, what happens if you've got energy substrate
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.360]   that you can't process, it's gonna be stored.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.720]   And that's of course why we have an obesity
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.320]   and overweight epidemic that's affecting close to 80%
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.600]   of American people. - That's so wild.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.320]   - It's just, we talk about obesity like it's the problem.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.840]   Obesity is one branch of a tree
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.520]   that's rooted in this mitochondrial dysfunction
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   that's caused by our environment.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.080]   And just to back up a little bit,
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.280]   to just sort of share kind of maybe like how I sort of
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.020]   started thinking about that,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.640]   I had trained as an ENT surgeon
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.720]   and I was at Stanford Medical School.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.000]   And I was so fascinated by this idea of like,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.960]   the way that we're defining the diseases we're treating
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   in like a specialty like ENT is like,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.360]   I saw sinusitis day in and day out
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.680]   and we'd have these patients on the table
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.680]   that we'd be literally drilling into their skulls
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.560]   to suck out sinus pus.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   And that's like the treatment for sinusitis.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.280]   And the way we diagnose the patients is we say like,
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.320]   okay, this patient has sinusitis
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.560]   if they have facial pressure, purulent pus,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.720]   nasal discharge, nasal obstruction and low sense of smell.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.840]   So if they have these symptoms, then they have this disease.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.000]   But when you actually go to the science
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.660]   and you actually go to the studies of like,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.680]   what is actually happening to create this,
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.640]   what you find is a lot of papers
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.080]   about mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.560]   Because sinusitis is in a chronic inflammatory condition
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.080]   where the cells are essentially sensing some threat
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.020]   and then they mount this immune response
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.040]   that creates swelling and then you get pus buildup.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.160]   But we confuse the pus buildup with the disease,
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.040]   which is actually happening inside the cells.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.240]   And so you start looking at PubMed as a clinician
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.080]   through a slightly different lens of like,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.760]   what's actually happening in the cells?
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.540]   And what you find for almost every chronic disease
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.080]   we're seeing in the US is that you will find a lot of papers
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.240]   on how the mitochondria are dysfunctional,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.800]   lower ATP generation in a lot of these cell types.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.640]   And then what does that do?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   And this gets to your question
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.460]   about chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.320]   Well, when you've got that dysfunctional mitochondria,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.840]   let's say in a nasal mucosal tissue,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.600]   that is a cell that can't do its job.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.080]   That is a cell that's underpowered
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.680]   and what could be more threatening to the body
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.600]   than a cell that can't do its job?
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.160]   So interestingly, those cells will initiate
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.420]   a whole process, which is called the cell danger response.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.240]   It's work that's been done by Robert Navio at UCSD,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.880]   where basically they understand the mitochondria
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.120]   is not working properly.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.680]   This is, of course, caused by the environment.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.440]   And they will actually release extracellular ATP,
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.840]   which is not really supposed to go outside of the cell.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   And that creates a massive innate immune response
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.780]   saying like, I'm underpowered, I need help.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.940]   My mitochondria is broken.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.240]   This is the cell releases ATP outside of the cell.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.600]   Usually the concentration of ATP
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.160]   is a million times higher inside the cell.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   So releases it almost as a neurotransmitter,
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.840]   a purogenic neurotransmitter
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.960]   that massively activates the immune system to come and help.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.920]   But the immune system comes and is like,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.620]   not much we can do for you here.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.240]   Because the problem is not something
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.320]   that the immune system can help with,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.120]   like grabbing a bacteria and lysing it,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.880]   or taking care of some cells infected with the virus.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.900]   The problem is outside the body.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.140]   It's the environment.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.180]   So you end up getting this tornado of dysfunction,
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.060]   of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the environment,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.960]   leading to the cell danger response,
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.740]   which leads to innate immunity.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.820]   And then on top of this, you get the oxidative stress,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.860]   which is the third piece of the trifecta,
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.380]   which is essentially these mitochondria
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.740]   trying so hard to do their work,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.960]   but they're not working properly.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.000]   So they create damaging metabolic byproducts
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.660]   called oxidative stress, free radicals
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.860]   that cause more damage.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.380]   So this is happening in the nose.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.060]   It's happening all over the American body
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.140]   because of our environment.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.820]   So you've got these tornadoes of interrelated physiology
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.860]   of mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation,
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.860]   oxidative stress, which if you start going to the research
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.200]   as a clinician who's focused on symptoms
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.380]   and confusing those for the disease,
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.620]   and look at what's the pathophysiology of arthritis?
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.060]   What's the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's dementia?
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.460]   What's the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.420]   obesity, fatty liver disease,
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.340]   polycystic ovarian syndrome, erectile dysfunction?
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.340]   It all traces back to this trifecta
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.340]   that no medication or surgery,
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.780]   you obviously can't operate on oxidative stress.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.460]   You can operate on the downstream symptoms.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.460]   So that's the real secret that I really feel like
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.380]   we need to reorient the healthcare system around
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.620]   since 90% of healthcare costs
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.460]   go towards treating the downstream symptoms of these.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.060]   And for every marginal dollar
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.580]   we're spending on treating symptoms,
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.780]   we're getting, the rates are going up
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.700]   because they're doing nothing
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.500]   to actually affect that trifecta.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.300]   But to really make it simple,
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.260]   I like to think of this trifecta of what I call
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.260]   trifecta of bad energy,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.820]   trifecta underlying metabolic dysfunction
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.820]   of chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction,
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.300]   oxidative stress as chronic inflammation
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.220]   is biochemical fear, it's response to a threat.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.060]   Mitochondrial dysfunction is kind of like
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.780]   rolling blackouts, it's not enough power.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.620]   And the oxidative stress is like wildfires.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.780]   So it's kind of, what's funny to me a little bit
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.300]   is like what's happening inside the cell
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.820]   is almost like what's happening like in our society.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.340]   It's like, this is like living in California.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.020]   It's like blackouts, fire, fear.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.540]   And that's literally what's happening inside our cell
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.980]   because of the environment.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.620]   And again, the optimistic news that you alluded to
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.620]   is that we actually have tons of tools and tests
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.540]   that can actually help us understand
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.220]   our level of metabolic health
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   and even give us hints about inflammation,
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.300]   oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.220]   And it's very easy to improve
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.740]   if we know what we're actually focused on.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.620]   - Well, that's reassuring
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.580]   and we're definitely gonna go there.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.540]   I appreciate the analogy to living in California.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.460]   I've lived here my entire life.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.020]   I have been outside of California,
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.220]   but perhaps the only thing you left out
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.140]   besides rolling blackouts, fires,
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:16.980]   and what was the other one?
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.820]   - Fear.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.740]   - And fear is high taxes.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.340]   The taxes, the health debt on the body.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.780]   So in any case, not to be too dark and pessimistic.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.900]   - Well, that's the healthcare cost.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.220]   - I maintain great hope
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.500]   and still a lot of love for California.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.340]   - It's pretty great.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.540]   - It's got, it's great aspects
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.900]   and it's not so great aspects.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.860]   And I can say that as a lifelong California resident,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.620]   there are other wonderful places to live.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.820]   A couple of questions.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.260]   First of all, about places to live.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.980]   You've been talking a lot about in the United States.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.460]   Are some of these same issues with metabolic dysfunction
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.940]   occurring outside of the United States?
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.100]   I would imagine so.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.940]   - Yep.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.060]   Any country where we've exported the standard American diet
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.540]   and some of the other norms of Western living
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.880]   are starting to see the same rates of chronic disease.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.060]   But like, it is worth not mincing words here.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.800]   Of all high-income countries in the world,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.180]   the United States has the worst chronic disease rates
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.820]   and the lowest life expectancy
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.240]   and our life expectancy is going down.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.300]   And we spend about twice as much on healthcare
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.060]   than the second highest spending country in the world.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.720]   So we are abjectly failing
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.220]   and that failure is predicated in our cult
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.220]   of siloing conditions into different specialties
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.600]   and not focusing on this root cause.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.700]   And I want to just be super clear.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.500]   There's a war being fought right now
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.480]   to get us to believe that siloing is the way
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.900]   because as you alluded to, siloing is profitable.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.900]   If you can convince doctors and people
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.360]   that there are 10 different symptoms or separate things,
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.320]   then they're going to 10 different specialist's office.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   Meanwhile, 75% of American adults are overweight and obese,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.500]   some of the highest in the world.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.640]   A full 50% of American adults now have prediabetes
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   and type 2 diabetes.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.320]   50%, 30% of teens have prediabetes.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.940]   40% of Americans have a mental health diagnosis.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.680]   Cancer is set to reach 2 million cases this year in 2024,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.580]   highest ever in recorded history.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.120]   Alzheimer's is going up.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.360]   Fat and liver disease is affecting 40% of adults,
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.720]   18% of teens.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.500]   Autoimmune disease is skyrocketing.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.040]   Infertility is going up at huge rates.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.900]   All these things are going up all at once in the U.S.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.620]   and yes, in many of the other countries
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.860]   that are eating our diet.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.280]   And there's no sign of it slowing down.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.060]   And so that's really, if you look at the research
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.500]   through this different lens,
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.000]   you'll find that all of those diseases trace back
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.580]   to metabolic dysfunction caused by our environment
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.420]   that no shot, pill or surgery can really address
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.700]   unless we unpack the environmental piece.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.240]   - Scary picture.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.720]   I'm glad that you're-- - But hopeful.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   - But hopeful. - We can fix it.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.880]   - Exactly, I'm glad that you are creating solutions.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.240]   And I should say, and just remind people,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.200]   I said this in my introduction,
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.680]   but you're talking about siloed medical care,
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.700]   you're talking about the kind of standard medical system,
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.480]   but let's not forget, right?
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.840]   I happen to be a faculty at Stanford.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.120]   You did your medical training at Stanford.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.580]   You are a medical doctor, right?
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.520]   I mean, you have a MD and are highly trained.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.560]   You were an ENT.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.660]   You're a nose and throat doctor.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.660]   So if anyone would be familiar with the industry
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.040]   and the practice and the educational system around this,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:42.880]   it's you.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.500]   So you're not speaking outside your ballywick.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.020]   So before we pivot to solutions,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.740]   I know people are eager to hear solutions,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.800]   but in order to understand
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.100]   how to best apply those solutions,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.980]   I do think it's worth drilling into some of the issues here
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.140]   just a little bit more.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.780]   You talked about underpowered cells.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.060]   You've also alluded to the fact
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.580]   that most people are consuming enough
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.020]   and probably excess amounts of caloric energy.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.940]   - Yes.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.940]   - So is it the lack of mitochondria
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.420]   or mitochondrial dysfunction
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.700]   that's at the root of the problem?
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.100]   The analogy I come up with is you've got a power plant
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.500]   that can convert incoming power line
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   to power that can be distributed to a community.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.860]   The community in this analogy
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.460]   being the organs and cells of the body.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.220]   There's plenty of potential energy.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.460]   But there's something about the power plant
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.740]   that is inefficient or dysfunctional.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.580]   There are shorts,
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.240]   there are circuitry that's just not working
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.340]   such that the energy that the community can benefit
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.580]   from the cells and organs of the body is just not there.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.420]   So it's not a lack of input,
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.200]   it's a lack of conversion and output.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.580]   And the consequence of this,
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.680]   we see in the form of excess adipose tissue
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.180]   and all the downstream effects.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.320]   It's not just aesthetic,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.580]   it's really all the downstream effects of visceral fat,
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.780]   subcutaneous fat, et cetera.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   What is it that would improve access to energy
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.820]   and energy utilization in cells?
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.220]   Is it simply a matter of getting the mitochondria
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.640]   to function better?
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.260]   Or is it that one can actually create more mitochondria?
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.820]   - This is the key question for how we can get healthy.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.820]   And it's really about creating capacity in the body
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.960]   to turn more potential energy to usable energy
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.720]   as opposed to taking that potential energy
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.480]   and shunting it to a storage form.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.040]   It's all just like, I think about everything visually
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.000]   and I'm like, you got the circular cell
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.420]   from high school biology textbook,
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.040]   inside are all the little mitochondria
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.280]   with the squiggly lines inside.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.160]   And it's just like there's Xs through those mitochondria.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.480]   So instead of, after glycolysis and you've got the pyruvate,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.400]   instead of going through the mitochondria,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.880]   it's being shuttled into something else.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.260]   And I mean, this is fundamentally
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.620]   the cause of insulin resistance
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.340]   because when the body senses that the mitochondria
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.620]   can't do that conversion process,
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.880]   the cell basically says, because I can't convert this,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.540]   I don't have the capacity to convert it to usable energy.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.460]   I'm gonna take the substrates and I need to block them.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.940]   I mean, you've got to turn them to basically a storage form,
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.140]   which inside the cell could be toxic fats
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.880]   like ceramides and diacylglycerol.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.480]   And I'm also gonna block the cell
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.540]   from taking any more substrates
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.780]   because I can't do anything with them.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.780]   That is fundamentally a route of insulin resistance.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.940]   So the body says, okay,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.300]   we're gonna block the ability of the insulin receptor
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.980]   to transduce its intracellular signaling pathway.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.500]   We're gonna block it.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.260]   And when that insulin binds,
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.180]   we're not actually gonna allow for glucose to come in.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.740]   So essentially insulin resistance is the cell compensating
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.980]   for the mitochondria being broken
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.140]   and telling the insulin receptor
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.800]   that it's not gonna be functional.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.500]   And so you don't get the glute receptors
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.700]   on the cell membrane to allow the glucose to come in.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.940]   So that's insulin resistance.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.420]   Again, we talk about that as the problem,
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.900]   but the problem is actually inside the cell
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.140]   leading to that.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.820]   So that's why just giving someone insulin
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.900]   isn't necessarily the answer.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.340]   We have to increase mitochondrial capacity
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.400]   to let the flow happen through it to energy,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.440]   which then trickles up
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.940]   into relieving a lot of these problems.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.940]   So to answer your question,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.060]   what we really wanna do to increase our metabolic capacity
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.020]   from a first principles perspective,
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.020]   it's we need to make more mitochondria.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:37.020]   We need to get each mitochondria to be more functional.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.020]   And we need to have each more functional mitochondria
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.260]   processing more energy substrates.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.740]   It's really that simple.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.060]   And the beauty is we can do all of those things.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.580]   If you actually break down
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.660]   like what those three things mean,
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.900]   it means promoting mitophagy,
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.340]   the recycling of old mitochondria to new mitochondria.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.260]   It means promoting mitochondrial biogenesis.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.380]   It means increasing the oxidative capacity
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.820]   of our individual mitochondria.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.160]   It means improving mitochondrial fusion,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   which is actually when mitochondria come together
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   to form long chains of mitochondria that are more efficient.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.340]   So there's like a lot of technicality
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.140]   to like what it means to print more mitochondria,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.420]   have them each be more efficient
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.840]   and have each one do more work.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.980]   But that's really what we wanna do.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.380]   And that's when it just kinda gets into the simple habits.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.820]   Like there's simple things we can do
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.820]   for each of those things.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.740]   For mitophagy, we can focus on various types
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.900]   of like endurance exercise
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.540]   and high intensity interval exercise.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.640]   There's compounds like urolithin A that promote mitophagy.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   When we talk about improving our oxidative capacity,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.660]   this is things like the sprint workouts.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.500]   We wanna build more mitochondria.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.700]   This is resistance training,
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.100]   literally telling the body to make more.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.420]   But first principles, it's how do we get more
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.180]   of these working better, doing more work every day?
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.840]   And then we think about, you look at the data on walking
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.240]   and it's like people who walk more than 7,000 steps a day
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.160]   have a 50 to 65% lower chance of dying in 10-year followups.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.000]   And it's like, yeah,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.900]   because walking is literally a glucose disposal signal.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.400]   So you're just simply asking.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.020]   It's not a great biogenesis signal.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.060]   It's not a great mitophagy signal, but it's a great disposal.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.260]   So if you're doing lifestyle habits
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.700]   that do one of those three things,
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.780]   which we can of course go into more,
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.980]   you're improving the cell's capacity
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.260]   to do that conversion process better.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.460]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.980]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.900]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.580]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.300]   every day since 2012.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.720]   And indeed that's true.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.220]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1 once
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.180]   or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.580]   that I might not be getting enough of
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.220]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.140]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.500]   And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.120]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.040]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.300]   it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.980]   and especially when I'm busy.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.220]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.540]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.500]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.140]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.700]   just report feeling better.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.980]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.240]   because it supports gut health.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.880]   And of course, gut health supports immune system health
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.860]   and brain health.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.980]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.480]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.260]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.820]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.940]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.300]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.620]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.820]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.840]   and physical health.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.140]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.500]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.940]   to claim a special offer.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.340]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.980]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.800]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.380]   There's a lot of great science
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.620]   and a lot of great stuff related to testing
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.480]   and assessment of one's metabolic health
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.540]   that we should get into and we'll get into.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.660]   But since we touched on lifestyle
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.260]   and because we've been talking about
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.540]   the sort of dysfunctional dark side for a bit,
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.680]   maybe we could just touch on some of the lifestyle factors
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.880]   that you just mentioned.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.820]   'Cause I do think it's important that people
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.760]   really start to feel into their sense of agency.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.980]   And here we're talking about things
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.660]   that are relatively low time investment,
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.020]   certainly don't have much financial cost
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.820]   in the sense that they could be done in gyms
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.520]   and with fancy equipment, but they don't require that.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.060]   Again, I wanna point out that these are not
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.660]   like strict prescriptives, but if you had a magic wand
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.500]   and because you are interested in the health of humans,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.320]   let's talk about a few of these things
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.100]   that can improve glucose disposal
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.920]   and mitochondrial function, mitophagy,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.660]   the removal of dead or dysfunctional mitochondria
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.400]   so they can be replaced.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.060]   Let's talk about the walking one first.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.380]   You said 7,000 steps a day.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.180]   I don't track my steps.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.620]   What are we really talking about there?
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.820]   We're talking about taking the stairs
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.460]   and trying to walk as much as possible.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.820]   Maybe we were gonna just give
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.180]   like a really crude prescription.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.740]   You're a doctor, so you can prescribe things.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.100]   What would you tell people to do?
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.820]   Like how many short walks per day?
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.940]   Is it like three?
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.700]   Is it five?
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.540]   What are we talking?
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.660]   - I would say, I mean, at least three,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.300]   I would say aiming for more than that is good though.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.420]   So to sort of just give a sense of the picture of walking,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.780]   if walking were a pill,
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.540]   it would be the most impactful pill we've ever had
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.500]   in all of modern medicine.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.820]   There was a paper in JAMA,
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.820]   6,300 participants followed for 10 to 11 years.
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:59.180]   And the people who simply walked 7,000 steps per day
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.860]   compared to less than that had an up to 70% lower risk
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.900]   of all-cause mortality in the follow-up period.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.860]   So not causality, but it's pretty incredible.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.620]   They've done follow-up research
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.660]   with slightly different numbers showing,
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.620]   again though, like many thousands of people
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.340]   in the study followed for about 10 years,
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.420]   8,000 to 12,000 steps per day
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:26.300]   was associated with 50 to 65% lower all-cause mortality.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.100]   And this has been played out in many studies
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.700]   showing about a 50% reduction in Alzheimer's,
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.300]   dementia, obesity, type two diabetes,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.620]   depression, cancer, gastric reflux,
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.700]   just all across the board.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.380]   And I think the key thing is that it's not about the steps.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.100]   It's about the fact that muscle contraction is medicine.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.620]   When we contract our muscles,
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.980]   even in a very like low-grade way,
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.460]   like walking or doing a couple of air squats,
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.500]   you know, we're activating AMPK
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.420]   and we are essentially causing that cell
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.780]   to have a stimulus to push glucose channels
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.980]   to the cell membrane.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.460]   Most of the time, the glucose channels are like in vesicles,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.820]   in little bags inside the cells.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.700]   They're not on the cell membrane.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.660]   So of course that's gonna keep the glucose
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.540]   in your bloodstream not being processed by the mitochondria.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.540]   So when we think about steps,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.220]   it's a proxy metric for just moving more throughout the day.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.740]   So let's take two people.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.900]   You have a person who's walking for one to two minutes
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.340]   every 30 minutes throughout the day.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.860]   Maybe they're exercising at the end of the day
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.460]   or the beginning of the day, maybe they're not.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.100]   That person is stimulating glucose channels
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.340]   to be at the membrane all day.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.180]   Now let's take another person
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.900]   who works out really hard for one hour
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.180]   in the beginning or the end of the day.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.100]   They feel great about it.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.420]   They've checked that off their box,
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.800]   but they're sitting the entire rest of the day.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.120]   Yes, they have gotten the benefits from the exercise,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.940]   but for a lot of that day,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.240]   those glucose channels are inside the cell,
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.300]   not doing the work they could be doing.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.580]   So I think about these little teeny short walking breaks
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.420]   or pushup breaks or air squat breaks
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.260]   every 30 minutes or so throughout the day
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.940]   as me essentially inside the cell
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.100]   pushing the glucose channels, the cell membrane,
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.540]   to make them constitutively active.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.580]   It's totally different physiology and it's so easy.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.620]   So it's not about the steps.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.500]   It's about muscle contraction regularly throughout the day.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.860]   And this has been shown out
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.280]   in actually more clinical research, which has taken,
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.260]   there's been several studies, two that I think are fascinating
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.020]   where they basically took two groups and they said,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.380]   okay, we're gonna have you walk 20 minutes before each meal,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.280]   three times a day, 20 minutes after each meal.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.820]   So that's also three times a day,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.340]   or for like two minutes every 30 minutes throughout the day.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   - So these are three separate groups?
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.180]   - Three separate groups.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.580]   - So either 20 minutes before, either 20 minutes after, or?
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.620]   - Two to three minutes every 30 minutes.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.580]   All added up to 60 minutes of walking
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.180]   or light jogging a day.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.940]   I'm kind of paraphrasing two different studies
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.840]   that showed the same thing.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.200]   One was jogging, one was walking,
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.300]   but it was basically chunks versus short walks
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.940]   every 30 minutes throughout the waking day.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.220]   The groups that do the short movement
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.780]   regularly throughout the day,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.940]   even though the total time is the same
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.980]   across all the groups,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.140]   have significantly lower 24-hour glucose level averages,
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   24-hour insulin level averages.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.740]   They are metabolically healthier.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.500]   And I believe, and the research mechanistically has shown
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.060]   that it's because we're constitutively
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.940]   putting these channels of the membrane
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.460]   to take up the substrate, use the substrate.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.900]   So this is not to replace exercise,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.600]   but I think it's a reframe.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.500]   I think the concept of exercise
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.540]   is something we're really very wedded to
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.120]   in our Western culture.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.740]   And you look at more like the Blue Zones
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.580]   and the Centenarians,
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.820]   and it's like they're kind of moving
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.020]   as built into their everyday life.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.460]   So we've taken movement out of our everyday life
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.740]   as these knowledge workers,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.540]   as we've been industrialized.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.700]   And then we think that exercise replaces
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.220]   that all-day movement,
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.940]   but biochemically, it does not.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.460]   So I think a big part of kind of digging ourselves
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.100]   out of this chronic disease mess
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.140]   and creating capacity for mitochondria
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.500]   is finding ways to take a lot of the activities
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.980]   we do now seated,
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.300]   and just find a way to do more of them moving,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.900]   standing, or walking.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.580]   Or if that's tough,
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.460]   you really need to sit at your desk all day,
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.020]   then every 30 minutes,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.580]   taking two minutes to do some just light movement,
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.660]   flex those muscles,
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.260]   get the glucose channels of the membrane,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.540]   get the mitochondria active.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.340]   So, and I think another fascinating stat is like,
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.280]   our gym memberships in the US have doubled
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.740]   since the year 2000,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.740]   and obesity has gone up in the same period.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.980]   So there's some mismatch between our obsession with exercise
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.500]   and our actual outcomes that we're seeing.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.860]   And I think it's that we have not actually rebuilt
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.060]   constitutive movement into our daily lives.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:00.900]   - Very interesting,
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.260]   'cause I think a lot of people are now working out,
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.940]   so to speak, doing resistance training,
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.020]   which I think is terrific.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.860]   - Terrific, yeah.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.660]   - Used to be such, you know,
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.060]   so restricted to niche subculture stuff,
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.740]   like bodybuilding, preseason football, military, et cetera.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.140]   And now it's a more ubiquitous for everybody,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.300]   men, women, young, old, that's terrific.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.980]   Same thing with things like yoga and cardiovascular training.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.820]   I mean, I like to study the history of exercise culture,
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.220]   and it wasn't, but in the '60s when, you know,
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.660]   jogging was considered kind of like,
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.120]   whoa, that's like a really esoteric niche culture thing.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.780]   So lots changed.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.140]   I love the prescriptives you gave
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.980]   because it's just very straightforward.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.580]   A couple of short walks, it just makes so much sense.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.120]   And I love the visual,
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.160]   and I hope people will really hold it in mind.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.740]   So I'll reiterate it.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.740]   The translocation of these energy utilization stores
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.620]   of vesicles, as you call them,
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.140]   these little packets from the center of the cell
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.100]   out to the cell surface,
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.620]   where then they can be involved, excuse me,
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.540]   in metabolic processes and the utilization of energy
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.020]   in ways that otherwise they wouldn't.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.500]   And glucose disposal being a big part of this.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.160]   So I have heard that a short walk after a meal
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.380]   will reduce blood glucose in a way that's really dramatic.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.900]   - Huge amount, 30, 35%,
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.020]   just taking a walk around the block after a meal.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.020]   That's definitely a prescription I think everyone should do
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.900]   'cause the research is so strong on it,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   is that building in simply a 10-minute walk around the block
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.820]   or a dance party in the kitchen,
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.060]   moving your muscles for 10 minutes after a meal
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.180]   can drastically reduce your glucose response
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.500]   'cause you're just bringing all those channels
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.780]   to the membrane, you're taking up the glucose,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.620]   you're using it.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.620]   It's a whole different physiology
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.380]   than sitting on the couch after a meal.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.620]   That's very high impact.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.440]   It's high leverage if it's after a meal.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.620]   So highly recommend that.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.120]   And the levels data and clinical data
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   has shown that out time and time again.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.640]   - Whenever I go to a city like New York
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.860]   when I am forced to walk more,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.740]   I always just feel so much better.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.300]   We also know that the optic flow
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.960]   that one experiences with walking
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.140]   has some interesting effects on the limbic pathways
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.300]   and quieting of some of the anxiety
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.360]   and stress-related pathways.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.140]   This links up with things like EMDR,
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.900]   although there are factors that are separate from EMDR.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.820]   Basically moving through space, not outer space,
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.620]   but walking through space with optic flow
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:22.120]   has a certain anxiety reduction function in the brain,
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.480]   which they're beautiful data there, in my opinion.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.720]   Okay, so that touches on walking.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.120]   You did mention higher intensity exercise.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.880]   So let's keep it within the cardiovascular realm for now.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.800]   So getting heart rate way, way up,
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   getting breathing hard for some minutes each week,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.560]   maybe a couple of times per week.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.860]   It seems that's a good way to increase mitochondrial
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.960]   function and mitochondrial number, is that right?
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.840]   - Yeah, so you take sort of each type of exercise.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.520]   We've got walking, we've got resistance training,
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.800]   we've got high intensity interval training,
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   we've got endurance training,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.040]   and then we've got sort of more like zone two.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.400]   So we've got these different flavors
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.680]   of how we get our heart rate up,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.160]   how we get the blood flowing, what we signal to the cells.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.120]   And each one actually has like a slightly different impact
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   on the mitochondria.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.840]   When we think about biogenesis,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.320]   we're thinking mostly like endurance exercise
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.840]   and really more of that zone two.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.160]   And like that is really gonna be a stimulus inside the cell
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.460]   to print more mitochondria.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.840]   When we think about improving mitochondrial fusion,
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.240]   high intensity interval training
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.860]   is really, really good for that.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.580]   When we think about resistance training,
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.360]   it's like that's like muscle hypertrophy,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.680]   we're gonna be creating more muscle cells
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.120]   and we need more mitochondria for those.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.480]   So each one has kind of a different impact.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.320]   And I think this is where honestly,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.560]   I think the regular guidelines that we have
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.360]   even by our government actually make a lot of sense.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.560]   It's like work every major muscle group three times a week
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.160]   in a resistance type training,
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.080]   and then work to get 75 to 150 minutes
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.300]   of moderate to strenuous activity.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.860]   So 75 minutes of strenuous activity
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.440]   or 150 minutes per week of moderate activity.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.280]   So that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.480]   80% of Americans are not meeting
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.420]   those very basic guidelines.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.120]   And 20% of Americans don't get any physical activity
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.960]   really at all.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.520]   Activity for the average American
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.560]   is 3,000 to 4,000 steps per day,
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.200]   which is less than two miles.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.400]   So we are not even close to even meeting
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.960]   the basic recommendations that are out there.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.140]   But I think those are pretty reasonable.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.560]   Resistance training two to three times a week,
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   most major muscle groups and working to get the heart rate
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.620]   up moderate level for 150 minutes a week
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.940]   or strenuous for 75 minutes a week.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.900]   Those are going together to be potent stimuli
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.340]   for biogenesis, mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion,
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.600]   for increasing antioxidant enzymes
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.660]   that are gonna protect the mitochondria
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.260]   from that oxidative stress.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.220]   And the one that's just actually not in there
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.520]   in sort of the basic recommendations for Americans
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.360]   is the walking.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.200]   And I would just absolutely add to that
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.640]   at least 7,000 steps per day
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.940]   based on what the data is showing,
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.740]   which honestly would probably take
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.140]   less than an hour total to do.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.820]   And if you break it up throughout the day,
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.740]   it's just a few minutes a day.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.340]   So that right there are gonna be like a big multifaceted
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:31.140]   set of signals for increasing mitochondrial capacity
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.740]   in different ways.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.800]   - Terrific.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.900]   What are your thoughts on under the desk treadmilling?
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.100]   I don't own one of these,
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.800]   but, and I try and get walks
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.700]   and I definitely do my three resistance training
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.660]   extra sessions per week,
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.260]   different muscle groups on different days.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.260]   So it ends up being each muscle group
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.920]   is hit directly once and indirectly a second time.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.460]   But I like to do a long hike once on the weekend,
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.060]   run in the middle of the week that's 30, maybe 35 minutes.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.420]   And then some VO2 max really short workout,
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.740]   12 minutes total, where basically I'm just going for,
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.420]   you know, the feeling that my heart
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.540]   is gonna jump out of my chest
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.980]   and I'm gonna die from gasping of air.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.980]   But luckily thus far I haven't died.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.280]   Nonetheless, the total time commitment isn't that great,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.220]   but I find that I'm at a desk a lot
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.980]   and I have a standing desk.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.380]   Is it wise to get a treadmill to treadmill under the desk?
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.860]   Seems like it would be one of the best things
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.900]   one could do.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.300]   - I'm a massive fan of under treadmill desk
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.580]   because genuinely I believe that if we move more
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.180]   of our daily activities that we're doing seated indoors
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.980]   to outdoors moving, it would radically change
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.620]   the health of the United States
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.700]   with real physiology underneath it.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.580]   So there's actually been research on under desk,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.420]   standing desk that is pretty interesting, small studies,
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.540]   but they, you know, took a handful of people.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.940]   I think it was around 10 in a workplace environment
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.620]   and they had them use under desk treadmills
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.260]   for two and a half hours per day during the workday.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.340]   So not a lot at very so speeds for two weeks.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.740]   And people lost on average, 2.6 pounds of fat
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.780]   and put on 2.2 pounds of lean mass.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.620]   - Wild.
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.020]   - In a very short period of time.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.160]   The study makes a somewhat wild claim
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.300]   that if this were extrapolated to a year,
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   we anticipate that we could see a loss of 44 to 66 pounds.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.460]   - Assuming it's a linear progression.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.460]   - Exactly.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.020]   - Which is not the case folks.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.740]   - That's why I'm saying it was a pretty,
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.140]   but that was there in the discussion.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.800]   And, but I think that short period is quite interesting.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.620]   So that's pretty significant.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.780]   And that's just for two and a half hours a day.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.460]   So I think now that they're about $150 on Amazon,
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.860]   these under desk treadmills,
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.820]   I think for anyone who's a knowledge worker,
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.300]   it's a good thing to have at your house.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.700]   And the way I use it is like,
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.420]   I basically just force myself to start my day
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.380]   on the treadmill desk.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.220]   And I say to myself,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.620]   if I don't like it after five minutes,
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.820]   I'll sit down if I need to sit,
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.660]   but I'll start and just see how it feels.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.920]   And then an hour goes by and I've forgotten I'm even on it.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.760]   - Is that right?
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.300]   So you're able to work without thinking about
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.100]   having to treadmill.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.820]   - I am putting it at such a slow speed.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.900]   I think I'm usually walking at like one mile per hour.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.620]   I mean, it's very, very glacially slow.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.500]   I do put my aura ring on my second toe when I do this,
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.320]   because otherwise it doesn't count my steps.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.100]   Because if your hands are at your desk,
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.220]   they won't count your steps.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.140]   - Because the aura rings measuring hand.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.300]   - Accelerometry, yeah.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.180]   But it's incredible how even at a 1.0,
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.500]   one mile per hour speed after two to three hours,
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.820]   you're easily gonna get six, seven, 8,000 steps
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.100]   and then throw in a couple other short walks
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.020]   throughout the day and you're getting there easily.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:49.580]   So it's just a great way to build back in
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.740]   what modernity took away.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.180]   And that unfortunately is unavoidable,
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.800]   that regular movement for good physiology.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.020]   So I'm a big fan of them.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.900]   And the data suggests that for a couple hours a day,
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.860]   they can actually have an impact on body composition,
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.300]   which I think is a great, easy,
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.940]   inexpensive thing for people to do.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.220]   But if you don't wanna buy one,
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.780]   like just set those timers and build in the walks
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.160]   throughout the day outside.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.420]   - Terrific.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.380]   Yeah, I'm a fan of getting walks when I can.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.980]   I also, one of your thoughts on, there was a study,
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.920]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   published at the University of Houston,
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.020]   where they looked at what they called soleus pushups,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.740]   which all the gym goers are gonna roll their eyes.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:41.360]   Imagine sitting down and pressing your toe
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.880]   against the ground and raising your heel.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.320]   So kind of like seated calf raise,
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.680]   but no weight right under the desk.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.460]   And this study had some remarkable claims and conclusions,
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.200]   which included, as I recall,
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.560]   that the activation of this muscle,
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.360]   the soleus, which makes up about 1%
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.800]   of the body's total musculature,
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.280]   involved, caused rather,
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.560]   a disproportionate use of blood glucose.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.960]   So it mobilized blood glucose in a good way.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.080]   And the idea was if people would,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.320]   it's not just bouncing your knee,
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.640]   but would actively push their toes against the ground
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.360]   and raise their heels as they were seated and doing work,
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.600]   that somehow there would be a positive effect
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.200]   on metabolism and blood glucose utilization.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.960]   I talked a little bit about this on social media
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.440]   and a few other podcasts.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.360]   And it was interesting to see the sort of attacks
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.920]   that I got, like people really didn't like the idea
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.720]   that this was any different than so-called NEAT,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.160]   non-exercise activated thermogenesis.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.720]   So it's known that people that fidget a lot
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.400]   or move around a lot burn a lot of calories.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.100]   This actually goes back to some really beautiful work
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.120]   several decades or more ago from Rothwell and Stock,
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.360]   who talked about like the fact that animals
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.040]   and people who fidget a lot burn a lot of energy.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:52.920]   They tend to be thinner,
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.380]   they tend to have lower adipose tissue stores.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.840]   And it's because they're just burning a lot more calories.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.200]   And this is actually what people who suffer from anorexia,
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.040]   which is by the way,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.720]   the most deadly of the psychiatric conditions.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.280]   So it's talking about true anorexia,
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.200]   are encouraged not to do
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.360]   because they either do it spontaneously
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.840]   or they learn that it's a very efficient way
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.280]   to burn calories and that's not what they need.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.040]   But many people do need to burn more calories.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.160]   So bouncing the knee,
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.600]   that thing that drives everybody crazy,
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.280]   if you're not the one doing it.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.760]   Soleus pushups.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.440]   What are your thoughts about this and that study?
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.880]   We don't have to pick it apart in detail,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.440]   but I thought it was kind of interesting.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.620]   It's all coming back to just moving the body
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.240]   as much as possible during the day.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.840]   Contracting muscles, contracting muscles.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.160]   - Contracting muscles, it's medicine.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.080]   And I find the concept of knee just endlessly fascinating,
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.920]   'cause we kind of come up with this term
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.880]   non-exercise activity thermogenesis,
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.680]   and the data is really good about it.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.720]   Like it's basically shows that this is a prime
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.280]   potential intervention for the obesity epidemic.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.480]   And it all goes back to the cell.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.440]   Like it's essentially a stimulus
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.320]   that's telling the body to stay metabolically active
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.800]   as opposed to keeping all those metabolic pathways
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.400]   dormant during the day.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.480]   And I think that it just, it is funny though,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.960]   that like we have these acronyms for basically like,
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.680]   this is just the way life was 100 years ago.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.800]   If you look at like the 1800s,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.240]   almost 100% of Americans lived on a farm,
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.720]   basically like pre-industrialization, pre-urbanization.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   Most Americans, not 100%, but close lived,
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.020]   they grew some of their own food.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.220]   They lived either on a farm or had a large garden.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.280]   Now that number is less than 1%.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.600]   So like movement was just built into everything we did.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   And you think from there, like what has happened?
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.000]   Like we were outside, we were moving,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.960]   our activities of daily living involved movement.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.500]   And if you just take the grocery example,
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.720]   then it moved to like, okay, maybe farmer's markets
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.560]   and sort of like outdoor open air markets.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.960]   Then it's supermarkets.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   Then it's, now it's literally buying food online
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.080]   with the click of the button.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.520]   And now some people aren't even doing that.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.560]   They're literally on the food
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.840]   delivered to them with Uber Eats.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.040]   So at every level we've taken away movement
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.880]   from everyday life.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.240]   And now we have sort of an acronym to like bring it back in.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.480]   But really it's about just, you know,
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.360]   giving the body stimuli that the cells have been entrained
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.560]   to expect throughout all of human history
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.840]   and building the back into our modern life.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.080]   So I think NEAT, it's incredibly important.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.780]   And I think it also brings up this point
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.240]   that like is so critical, which is like,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.680]   I really think our way out of this chronic disease epidemic.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   And even for people who are listening,
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.740]   don't have a chronic disease,
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.980]   any real chronic symptoms we're dealing with.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.120]   And just the fact that we're not feeling
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:44.960]   as good as we could.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.260]   Like the way out is pretty simple.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.740]   Like it's some of these basic things
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.940]   like walking more throughout the day,
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.460]   moving more throughout the day,
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.740]   getting outside, you know, eating clean, unpoisoned food.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:04.180]   A lot of these things that have the best data are so simple.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.540]   And I think it's like really important
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.800]   to just always remember like the game and the industry,
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.820]   it's all about how complex can we make it?
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.740]   Like specialization, talking about some of the minutiae,
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.240]   but like at the end of the day,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.580]   all the simple habits that we know are healthy,
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.740]   like fundamentally improve cellular biology.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.140]   And like some of these things like the NEAT,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:28.340]   like the walking, like it's emblematic of the fact
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.340]   that some of the simplest solutions
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.060]   are the ones that are by far the most effective.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.100]   And I think the biggest misconception
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.640]   in healthcare right now is that the way out
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.820]   and the way to get really back
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.260]   to true incredible health is complicated.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.060]   Like it's really not that complicated.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.540]   We've got to move more, you know,
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.700]   throughout the day, that's one of them.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.620]   And, you know, on each pillar that we touched on earlier,
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.780]   food, sleep, all of this, you know,
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.900]   when we talk about the simple habits that we know work,
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.980]   the reason they work is 'cause they all positively impact
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.640]   the mitochondria, they positively impact oxidative stress,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.380]   they positively impact inflammation.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.560]   So, yeah.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.400]   - I love it.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.800]   I love simple solutions that hit multiple cellular pathways
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.720]   that can make everybody healthier.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.160]   I'd like to just take a quick break
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, InsideTracker.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.800]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.440]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.080]   to help you better understand your body
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.040]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.240]   Now, I've long been a believer
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.920]   in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.320]   that many of the factors that impact our immediate
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.560]   and long-term health can only be addressed.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.900]   That is, can only be measured with a quality blood test.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.800]   Now, one issue with many blood tests out there
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.280]   is that you get information back about lipid levels,
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   hormone levels, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.880]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.600]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.240]   to understand your levels and what they mean
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:56.080]   and specific actionable items that you can undertake
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.200]   in order to bring those levels into the ranges
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.560]   that are optimal for you.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.560]   InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.800]   which enables coaches and health professionals

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.600]   I'd like to talk about assessment,
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.680]   blood tests in particular.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.640]   I remember in college,
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.180]   I was just very curious about blood testing
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.640]   and I had read a little bit about it,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.680]   but it was really hard to access.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.840]   I actually went to the student health center and said,
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.960]   can I just get my lipids measured,
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.160]   some hormone stuff measured?
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.000]   I was in great health.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.680]   I just want to do that.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.920]   And they're like, no, what's the issue?
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.000]   Why would you do that?
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.620]   Now it's very easy to find places that will do blood tests,
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.600]   but there is some cost often.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.880]   And nowadays, thanks to your efforts,
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.640]   your innovative and engineering efforts
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.940]   and the efforts of others,
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:02.720]   there are ways to measure what's in your blood
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.360]   and blood glucose in particular
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.760]   with continuous monitoring and with snapshot monitoring.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.320]   So let's talk about blood tests.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.940]   What do you think are the three to five things
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.560]   that basically everybody, if they can,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.280]   should know about what's circulating in their blood?
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.000]   I'm imagining LDL, HDL, this kind of thing.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.960]   I guess ApoB is a big favorite of our friend, Peter Atiyah.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.480]   Fasting blood glucose, continuous blood glucose,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.740]   post meal, et cetera.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.000]   Just kind of evaluating how exercise, food, et cetera,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.360]   impacts blood glucose.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.160]   And then I'll leave the other categories open
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.480]   'cause my point here is not to answer the question.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.320]   That's what comes to mind.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.040]   - You've got the big ones.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   So this is key is that every single person listening,
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.600]   I hope after this episode will go to their health record
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.440]   or send their doctor a message
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.060]   and at least get the following test.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:04.060]   And the first seven that I'll mention are very basic
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.400]   and people might take umbrage to them
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.160]   because obviously there's a lot of debate
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.440]   about what's everyone's favorite lab test.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.840]   But I think about it as what are the basics
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.920]   that everyone should know?
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.960]   And then what's the next tier up
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.680]   that are easy to access and are cheap
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.160]   that'll give you a lot more richness,
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.040]   but which you still might have to fight your doctor for.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.860]   So the first few that you will not have to fight
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.140]   your doctor for and are often free on an annual physical
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.600]   and literally define metabolic syndrome
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.760]   are fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.680]   HDL cholesterol, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol,
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.960]   waist circumference and blood pressure.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.000]   - Okay, sorry, I hate to interrupt
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.400]   and my audience hates it even more,
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.480]   but I'm gonna just, could you just explain
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.920]   what each of those is and what it corresponds to?
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.760]   - Yes. - Great, thank you.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.920]   - And I will say, first of all,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.240]   the reason I'm choosing these,
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.160]   it's not even my own choice really.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.120]   It's two reasons.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:57.500]   One is that the two studies over the past five years
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   that have shown us in large populations
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500]   that the vast majority of American adults
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.020]   are metabolically dysfunctional use those biomarkers.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.300]   So I think because of that, it's important to know them.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.740]   And the two studies that I'm referring to
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.180]   are one from UNC in 2018,
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.380]   which showed that based on those biomarkers,
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.500]   88% of American adults have suboptimal metabolism.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.740]   And then a follow-up study
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.020]   from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.180]   from last year showed that that number has gone to 93.2%
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:28.340]   of American adults are suboptimal in their metabolism.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.780]   And these are the metrics that they use
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.820]   and they're very basic.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.060]   If you had to pay out of pocket,
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.660]   they would be less than $100.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.780]   So let's talk through them.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.620]   Why they're great is because together,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.940]   they give you kind of like a tapestry
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.540]   of what's actually happening inside the cell.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.740]   If you choose to look at them that way,
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.500]   if you read the tea leaves of them,
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.420]   are the doctors often, if they see all these lab tests,
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.840]   it'll be in an electronic health record.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.860]   We've all been through this experience.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.020]   They'll come up on the screen
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.580]   and there'll either be like a green, orange,
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.340]   or red color next to it.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.540]   Like it's high, it's low, it's borderline.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.980]   And the doctor will basically, it's very algorithmic.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.020]   Oh, your LDL is high, we need to bring it down.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.420]   Oh, your glucose is high, we need to bring it down.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.060]   Oh, your blood pressure is high, we need to bring it down.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.180]   But what I'm inviting people to do
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.780]   is understand a little bit about each test
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.220]   and then read the tea leaves
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.860]   of what it's telling us about our mitochondria.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.300]   So let's start with fasting glucose.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.260]   So fasting glucose, when you look at these studies
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:33.980]   that I'm referring to, they call optimal less than 100.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.180]   So to define whether you were in that 88 or 93%,
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.020]   you had to essentially be in their optimal range
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.060]   for all biomarkers, not on medication.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.860]   So I'll quickly run through what their ranges were.
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.980]   My ranges for optimal are tighter than these,
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.540]   but fasting glucose less than 100,
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.340]   triglycerides less than 150,
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.420]   HDL above 40 for men or 50 for women,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.660]   hemoglobin A1C less than 5.7%,
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:04.660]   total cholesterol to HDL ratio less than 3.5 to one,
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.740]   waist circumference less than 35 inches for women
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.060]   or 40 inches for men,
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.780]   and blood pressure less than 120 over 80.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.260]   If those things were in those ranges
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.300]   and you weren't on medication for blood sugar
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.020]   or blood pressure or whatnot,
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.820]   you were considered optimally metabolically healthy.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.200]   That's now 6.8% of Americans.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.940]   All of these biomarkers are easy to change
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.500]   in one to two months, I would say,
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.100]   with simple lifestyle habits.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.100]   - Could you remind us what hemoglobin A1C is?
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.460]   I think most people are familiar with HDL cholesterol
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.340]   being the quote unquote good cholesterol
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.660]   and LDL being the bad cholesterol.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.300]   And as I say that, I know I'm gonna get dogpiled.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.940]   - Yeah, oh, totally, yeah.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.060]   I'm not sure that I adhere to that.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.320]   I'm not sure I don't adhere to that.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.180]   I'm not sure about a lot of things.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.860]   But I am sure that most people think of them that way.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.460]   So just to stay functional here,
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.440]   we'll frame it that way for now with the caveat
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.220]   that that might not be the whole story,
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.380]   isn't the whole story.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.860]   But triglycerides, fat in the blood, fatty stuff.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.060]   - That's so key to understand about the triglycerides.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.500]   We don't wanna confuse triglycerides with eating more fat.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.260]   Triglycerides are a storage form
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.780]   of excess carbohydrates in the blood.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.020]   So this is why it can tell us something about,
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.420]   and I know you and Rob Lustig talked about this at length,
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.980]   but it's- - And Lane Norton.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.820]   - And Lane, yeah.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.500]   - Yeah, I mean, one of the things that's really tricky,
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.660]   gosh, is that the language around nutrition and health
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.560]   is complicated because people hear the word fat,
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.940]   they think body fat,
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.660]   but then they also think the macronutrient fat.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.660]   We just need more words to better parse the reality.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.140]   In biology, we call the two major groups of people,
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.460]   lumpers and splitters.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   Lumpers like to lump everything together.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.180]   It oversimplifies and complicates.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.740]   Splitters like to split everything,
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.980]   give a name for everything,
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.380]   individual name for everything.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.220]   It complicates.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.580]   And so there's a middle ground, right?
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:02.620]   There's a land of reasonable people and nomenclature.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.220]   And unfortunately, that does not exist on the internet,
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.140]   nor does it exist in any one specific subfield
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.020]   of medicine or science.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.320]   I mean, so much of the confusion out in the world
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.220]   is because of a lack of adequate language
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.120]   in order to explain.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.620]   Okay, so the triglycerides are a reflection
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.340]   of excess carbohydrate intake.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.580]   - And how it's helping us with that tapestry
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.220]   of understanding the trifecta of bad energy
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.300]   is that if you think about it,
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.740]   let's just go back to that cell and that poor mitochondria
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.540]   that's being absolutely decimated by our environment
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.020]   and its capacity is low.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.780]   Okay, so that mitochondria is like,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.560]   I can't process glucose or fatty acids to ATP very well,
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.020]   so I'm gonna block their entry into the cell.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.180]   So now you've got glucose rising in the bloodstream.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.620]   So, okay, fasting glucose,
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.700]   that was one of our biomarkers.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.900]   If that's going up, that is a little bit of that tapestry
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.560]   of maybe something's going on inside the cell
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.020]   that's blocking the entry into the cell,
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.100]   so it's rising the bloodstream.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.820]   Okay, well, where's all that?
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.060]   The body does not want lots of glucose
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:00.260]   floating around in the bloodstream
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.180]   because it can literally independently cause
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.460]   endothelial dysfunction,
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.980]   which is basically blood vessel problems.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.560]   It can cause oxidative stress in the bloodstream.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.820]   It can cause glycation,
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.360]   which is sugar literally just sticking to things.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.540]   The body doesn't want that glucose high in the bloodstream,
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.400]   so it converts it to triglycerides to be stored
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   in a storage form of energy.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.640]   That's a key point that I think is helpful to understand
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.560]   is that the body,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.360]   it's always trying to kind of keep things in the right range
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.480]   so it'll convert things.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.220]   So then triglycerides, a picture in your blood
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.040]   of glucose being high and triglycerides being high
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.680]   is very much should signal to everyone
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.800]   when they look at their labs
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.720]   that there's probably something going on inside the cell
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.240]   that's blocking the cell from being able to use and process.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.260]   It's a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.880]   and chronic overnutrition.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.920]   Too much substrate, not enough processing,
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.840]   glucose is gonna go up, triglycerides are gonna go up.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.640]   And so then if you kind of squint and read the tea leaves,
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.640]   it's like, huh, I think metabolic dysfunction.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.060]   And what's fasting is that the travesty
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.140]   in our healthcare system
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.300]   is that a patient might go into the doctor
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.380]   and their fasting glucose is 99,
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.060]   one point under what we'd consider the normal range
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.940]   and their triglycerides are 149,
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:18.460]   one point under what we'd consider the normal range
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.380]   from these things.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.700]   That doctor might say to that patient, you're totally fine.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.340]   Both glucose and triglycerides are normal.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.620]   But that's just really problematic
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.880]   because they're on the upper end of normal
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.480]   for both of those.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.120]   And so really what that would say to me
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.480]   as someone thinking about the mitochondria
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.320]   is like this person
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.600]   is definitely metabolically dysfunctional.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.560]   They're on the highest end of normal
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.280]   for both triglycerides and glucose.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.320]   There's something,
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.400]   there's definitely insulin resistance going on here.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.440]   I would much rather see that glucose at 73
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.460]   and that triglyceride at 50,
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.840]   which to me would say,
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.120]   oh, this cell's processing through energy, great.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.960]   And things are moving through
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.060]   and we're not backing up in the bloodstream.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.460]   We're not converting to triglycerides.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.900]   So that's where really optimal ranges get in.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.780]   But so that's glucose and triglycerides.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.260]   Why, if those are starting to creep up,
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.020]   it's a sign that something is happening metabolically.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.020]   And then when we look at some of the other biomarkers,
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.740]   so hemoglobin A1C is really,
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.380]   so that's a marker that's looking at
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.360]   how many of the hemoglobin molecules
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.940]   that are in the red blood cells that carry oxygen,
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:28.020]   how many of those hemoglobin molecules
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.080]   have sugar stuck to them,
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.860]   and that's glycation.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.440]   So you're looking at glycated hemoglobin.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.160]   And you can imagine that if the concentration of glucose
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.920]   is higher over time,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.000]   more glucose is gonna stick to red blood cells.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.080]   And that's gonna create a higher percentage
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.960]   of glycated hemoglobin.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.080]   So that's why that lab is represented as a percentage.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   So less than 5.7 is what we want.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.560]   - You want those cells nice and smooth and slippery.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.320]   - No sugar stuck to them, causing dysfunction.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.260]   And because blood cells last for about nine to 120 days,
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.780]   hemoglobin A1C is giving us basically a snapshot
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:11.280]   of average blood sugar levels over nine to 120 days.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.420]   And if that average is higher, again,
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.300]   probably a sign that cells are rejecting glucose
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.380]   from the cell and it's causing a rise in the bloodstream.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.180]   And then just talking about one other biomarker
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.720]   in that that we talked about, which was blood pressure,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.760]   people might say, well, how does blood pressure relate
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.600]   to like what's going on inside the cell,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.560]   you know, in the mitochondria and whatnot?
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.920]   And the fascinating link is that
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.080]   when that cell becomes insulin resistance,
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.580]   which again is a compensatory mechanism
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   for mitochondrial dysfunction,
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:46.080]   the insulin is gonna rise in the blood
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.480]   'cause the body's insulin resistant.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.200]   So the body's gonna churn out more insulin
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.760]   to try and overcome the insulin block
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.120]   to drive the sugar into the cells.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.240]   So insulin levels rise.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.240]   Well, insulin is one of the key activators of nitric oxide,
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.040]   which is the molecule in the blood that dilates
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.480]   and relaxes blood vessels.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.460]   And so when we become insulin resistant
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.820]   and we're not responding to that insulin signal,
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.760]   we end up getting less nitric oxide activity.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.060]   So this is how kind of looking at even these very basic,
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.560]   very cheap biomarkers through the lens
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.480]   of basic cellular physiology, we can start to see,
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.080]   man, my body might be like underpowered.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.600]   I might have a mitochondrial issue here.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.960]   So that's a few of those tests
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.480]   that we really wanna shoot for.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.000]   - Terrific, and thanks for bringing up blood pressure again.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.800]   It's sort of comes across to many people as old school,
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.520]   right, but when Atiyah was here,
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.880]   one of the several times he was here,
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.720]   he really pushed on blood pressure
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.560]   as such a key metric, right?
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.960]   I mean, obviously, if blood pressure is high,
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.200]   you're getting less nitric oxide through whatever means here.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.520]   Vessels and capillaries are constricted.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.940]   Cells aren't able to use the energy that's coming in.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.800]   There's excess energy.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.400]   There's buildup of metabolic waste.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.560]   There's all this stuff.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.880]   And now we can start to see the picture
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   that's trying to emerge.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.320]   And as you mentioned briefly,
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.840]   these markers can be put into healthy range
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.700]   or maybe even fantastic range in a very short period of time.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.340]   So we'll talk about how to go about that.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:19.600]   In terms of getting a basic blood test,
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.500]   as your physician, what's the secret code?
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.300]   I'll give away one that a former guest
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.940]   who's also an MD shared,
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.300]   which is oftentimes if you ask your physician
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.020]   for a blood test, they will say,
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.740]   "Well, unless there's a particular need
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.440]   "or you're struggling with something,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.740]   "they won't give it to you."
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.580]   But if you have a shift from baseline in a symptom
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.540]   or in a number that can help,
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.460]   all the physicians are gonna come after me now with,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.860]   I guess, with stethoscopes.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.000]   I'm willing to stand my ground.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.680]   If you want a blood test,
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.040]   it's often useful to mention
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.200]   that there's been some market shift.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.520]   You wanna be honest, right?
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.920]   But some market shift in sleep, in lifestyle,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.200]   in how you feel standing up, sitting down.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.640]   I'm not trying to lace people's minds with ideas
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.380]   to create narratives here,
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.080]   but oftentimes where physicians are resistant,
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.720]   there'll be more amenable if they understand that,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.980]   "Hey, like something's changing."
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.400]   And the patient's saying something's changing.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.740]   It actually would be irresponsible of them
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.760]   to not give the blood test.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.360]   So there you go.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.680]   Bring it on, MDs.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.520]   - Yeah, truly.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   And I think the nice thing about these,
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.300]   again, very basic tests,
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.800]   and there are so many other tests
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.640]   that I talk about in my book
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.000]   and that you've talked about on your podcast,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.400]   ApoB, uric acid, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HSCRP,
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.960]   liver function tests, GGT,
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.360]   all these other tests that are great
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.680]   that can really tell us more about mitochondrial dysfunction,
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.780]   oxidative stress, chronic inflammation.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.920]   But the ones I'm mentioning
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.600]   are the ones that you will not have to fight
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.560]   with your doctor about.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.640]   - Oh, good.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.980]   - Everything I just mentioned,
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:52.920]   the doctor should order on an annual physical.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.880]   And it's really about us learning
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.720]   to actually read the tea leaves of what they're saying
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.840]   and not look at them in this algorithmic way,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.680]   but how together, if they're creeping up
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   or if many of them are a little bit high,
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.840]   we need to focus all of our energy
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.900]   on improving mitochondrial capacity, basically,
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.240]   and bring those numbers down,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.400]   which we can do very, very quickly.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.680]   Once you start getting the mitochondria
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.960]   moving through more of those substrates,
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.840]   a lot of them will just naturally come down.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.440]   Now, in the book, I give scripts
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.040]   to literally talk to your doctor with,
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.820]   because you are gonna get pushback.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.620]   Often, if you ask for a fasting insulin,
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.760]   I would say probably, I mean,
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.000]   even though doctors are waking up a little bit,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.880]   like maybe 85% of people are gonna have their doctor say
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.920]   they won't order that for them.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.320]   So I actually think there's a huge benefit.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.340]   I hate to say it, but like going outside the system,
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.580]   this is where I think innovation has been valuable.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.040]   There's a lot of like amazing companies
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.280]   doing direct-to-consumer lab testing,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.320]   so you can basically avoid the hassle,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.400]   and some of them are very affordable.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.600]   There's Function Health is a company
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.820]   that's doing 110 biomarkers,
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.400]   including all the key metabolic biomarkers
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.960]   for less than $500, and they'll do it twice a year,
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.000]   so you don't ever have to, and then they do interpretations.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.560]   InsideTracker, Next Health, Levels is doing labs,
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.200]   and so there's a lot of this springing up
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.280]   because I think people are sick of fighting
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.560]   with their doctors to get a crumb of information
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.560]   about their health, and we should probably be testing these,
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.440]   I would say, three to four times a year,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.360]   and the beauty is is that like,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.960]   I think a lot of what keeps people down in the health world
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.880]   is that they're confused about what to do.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.000]   There's a lot of noise.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.440]   There's a lot of different strategies.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.440]   Do I do paleo, keto, carnivore, vegan, Mediterranean?
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.760]   Do I do HIT or Zone 2 or eccentric?
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.960]   It's like there's so much noise,
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.340]   and the beauty with having a plan
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.200]   for understanding your biomarkers regularly
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.380]   is that you can cut through all the noise.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.700]   Try a strategy, see where you stand,
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.920]   retest in a few months,
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.120]   and see if you're moving in the right direction.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.360]   You don't have to trust your doctor.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.200]   You don't have to trust me.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.720]   You don't have to trust anyone.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.600]   You can literally trust your own labs,
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   and I say to people, like, if your labs are optimal,
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.560]   and the ranges I just mentioned are not optimal,
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.840]   like you wanna actually get to better than all of those,
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:25.840]   if your key metabolic biomarkers are optimal,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.880]   if you feel absolutely freaking incredible
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.560]   and you have no symptoms,
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.520]   then you're probably doing the right strategy,
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.660]   whatever that is, vegan, keto, whatever,
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.520]   like an exercise in your lifestyle
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.720]   because that is showing that your cells
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.640]   are fundamentally working properly.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.680]   So I think that's just a really empowering message.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.800]   Now there's phenomenal companies that are cropping up
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.720]   to basically help allow people to do this
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   on their own schedule,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.280]   which I think is really the future of health,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.620]   and actually will help lessen, I think,
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.200]   some of the intensity of the diet wars,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.160]   'cause it's like people can just say,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.480]   like, I trust my strategy.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.780]   I know I'm doing what's right for me
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.860]   'cause look at all my biomarkers, and I feel great.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.140]   - Yeah, what used to be the before and after,
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:13.800]   pre-diet exercise, post-diet exercise photos
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.740]   on social media are now starting to also include numbers,
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.200]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.480]   I mean, obviously these aren't randomized controlled trials,
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.600]   but it's cool to see people posting their numbers
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.200]   of things that are not just related to aesthetics
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:31.560]   but are, or body weight, but are related to health metrics.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.400]   - Yeah.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.760]   - So it's fun.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.400]   I think it speaks to a more scientific
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.200]   or at least a more quantitative approach to things,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.360]   and I think it's inspiring for people.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.160]   Thanks for putting those scripts in the book
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.400]   that people can refer to.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.760]   Let's say that I go in for these blood tests.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.400]   I do the basic seven,
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.200]   and I find that my fasting glucose is a little high.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.280]   My triglycerides are a little high.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.880]   My LDL is a little high.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.320]   Maybe a few other things are okay.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.880]   So I'm kind of in the, you know,
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.360]   not in the red zone, but I'm in the like,
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.060]   you should probably pay attention to these things.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.000]   What are some of the things that one can do
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.960]   in order to try and move those needles
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.780]   in the right direction?
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.960]   I know we talked about walking and movement before.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.920]   What are a few others?
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.420]   And maybe we could start to touch into nutrition
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.840]   a little bit, and then we'll pivot
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.580]   to insulin and blood glucose.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.120]   - I think on the highest level,
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.040]   it's about running through what are the science-based things
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.520]   that we know in our environment
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.480]   can lead to metabolic dysfunction,
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   and take honest stock of how those factors
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.640]   are playing out in your life,
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.840]   and then choose a few to start moving
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.200]   in a different direction.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.820]   So the ones that I think are ones
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.320]   that we can really control,
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.440]   and that we know, based on the science,
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.360]   are impacting our mitochondrial metabolic health
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.200]   is the food, the sleep, the movement,
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.840]   the emotional health, the toxins,
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.760]   our relationship with light,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.500]   and our relationship with temperature.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.180]   And your journey to optimal metabolic health
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.000]   might be totally different from mine,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.660]   'cause I might really need to focus on the food,
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.200]   and the sleep, and the emotional health,
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.040]   and you might really need to focus on the toxins,
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.900]   and the light, and the movement.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:13.820]   And so a lot of it is actually taking stock
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.900]   on where the levers are in your own life.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.140]   Where are you crushing it,
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.060]   and where is there a lot of room for improvement?
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:24.980]   So step one is knowing that those are the things
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.300]   in our environment that we need to basically improve
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.060]   to give ourselves the best capacity.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.700]   And then, of course, checking your biomarkers
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.860]   to make sure your interventions are working.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.240]   But food, I think, is one that is totally unavoidable.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.460]   Of those pillars, those seven pillars,
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.880]   food is one that most of us are getting wrong,
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.780]   and that we really actually have to get right
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.880]   to improve our metabolic health, for a lot of reasons.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.740]   I mean, our bodies are basically 100%
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.540]   molecularly made from food.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.380]   - That's so wild.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.260]   - It's so wild.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.980]   Every time I think about that, it kind of blows my mind.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.900]   - Like, babies are 3D printed from food, basically,
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.300]   inside a woman's body.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.680]   It's wild to me.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.620]   And then, what's so cool about the body,
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.780]   what brings me just immense awe every day
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.820]   is that we have this conception in our Western world
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.380]   that the body is like a thing
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:11.580]   that we're with throughout our life,
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.740]   'cause we kind of look the same, and we age slowly.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.900]   So it's like, Casey is a thing, and Andrew is a thing,
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.660]   but the body is actually a process.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.820]   The body, and there's this amazing Taoist statement,
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.980]   like, "Life is a process, not an entity."
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.820]   - I love that.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.640]   - And the way--
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.700]   - No, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:31.700]   I'm just, I always wish that if people could understand
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.940]   that with biology and health,
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.580]   understanding the nouns and the names is important,
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.660]   but it's verbs.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.440]   It's verbs, verbs, verbs.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.740]   If you understand that things are processes,
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.620]   or processes, depending on who you are
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.180]   and where you live in the world,
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.140]   it all becomes so much more tractable.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.420]   - Yes, and it's so much more hopeful,
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.020]   because if I'm a process, if you're a process,
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.220]   then every day we're eating, we are changing the process.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   Whereas if you think you're a thing, then there's no hope,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.140]   'cause I'm just, I'm Casey, and that's who I am,
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.660]   and I have this disease, you know?
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.940]   And I think so much in our language, actually,
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:12.020]   of healthcare, both our Western
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.540]   sort of de-spiritualized nature,
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.500]   like we don't really have a lot of curiosity with process,
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.640]   but even like the ideas, the way we talk about disease,
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.620]   I have diabetes, and we don't even talk
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.100]   about diabetes cures, which now a lot of people
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.740]   are curing their diabetes, we call it remission.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.660]   Like it's this thing that's a part of you,
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.580]   and I think, I just love this idea
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.100]   of like we're evolving every day,
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.100]   and food is so important, because again,
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.540]   we take in 70 metric tons of food in a lifetime,
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.820]   two to three pounds per day,
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.140]   one metric ton per year on average,
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.620]   and that is like the printer ink.
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.620]   That's the 3D printer ink to create
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.900]   tomorrow's version of ourself,
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.780]   which is molecularly different than the Casey of today.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:52.140]   That's a hopeful message,
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.260]   because if we can give the body food,
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.980]   which I think we, again, our conception of food,
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.520]   I think, is very limited.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.020]   Food is the molecular building blocks of the body.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.700]   It is the cell-signaling functional molecules
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.300]   that tell our cells what to do.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:16.300]   They act as transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers,
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.900]   cell-signaling pathway intermediates,
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.740]   and it's also, of course, the substrate
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.420]   to change what the microbiome does,
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.300]   and the composition of the microbiome,
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.340]   which is basically a pharmacy inside our bodies
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.780]   to create different molecules that can affect our health.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.540]   So food is certainly a calorie is a calorie
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.480]   from the concept of thermodynamics,
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.600]   but from the concept of molecular information,
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.460]   it has three massively important parts
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.800]   that are unavoidable for creating cellular health.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.960]   So I would just say that that is the pillar
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.020]   that we can be happy to drill into
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:56.060]   of what do we really do to build
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.820]   as much metabolic health as possible.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:02.240]   - Yeah, I want to focus now, if you're willing, on food,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:05.180]   not just macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.420]   not just calories, although that as well,
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.240]   but things like timing, things like fasting,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.680]   and micronutrients, which I think
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.480]   is a highly underexplored topic.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.160]   So with respect to food, gosh, I feel like
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.200]   we've all been exposed to pretty much every variation
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.840]   of it's all calories in, calories out.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.160]   And by the way, I believe in the laws of thermodynamics.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.600]   So yes, total caloric load matters.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.120]   Total energy expenditure matters, without question.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.120]   Within the framework of not consuming excess calories,
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.840]   there's a lot to explore, however.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.360]   I can just say for myself, for what it's worth,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.220]   I'm not very hungry until 11 a.m., noon, or one.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.800]   I'm okay not eating until then.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.860]   And just, you know, water, electrolytes, and caffeine
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.740]   does me just fine.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.820]   I can exercise, et cetera.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.780]   But once I start eating, I really enjoy eating,
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.380]   and I mostly like the proteins.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.620]   I like meat, and fish, and eggs,
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:05.200]   and I like cheese, and vegetables, and carbohydrates,
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.100]   and fruit, and all of it.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.180]   I like all the stuff.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:11.420]   And I tend to like single or few ingredient foods.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.340]   I just naturally do.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.720]   So I've been lucky in that way.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:19.500]   But I know a lot of people like sandwiches, processed foods,
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.580]   things that are combinations of ingredients.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:27.580]   What do we know about kind of, I don't want to say optimal,
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.260]   but if one, we're going to explore different ways of eating
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.120]   for sake of adjusting these biomarkers
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.100]   in the right direction and improving metabolic health.
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:39.540]   Is there kind of a generic jumping off point?
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.300]   Would most people, for instance, be wise to cut back
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.720]   on the total number of sugars,
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.380]   or the total amount of sugar, rather,
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.980]   perhaps reduce the amount of carbohydrate
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.900]   and replace it with some lean quality protein?
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.540]   I mean, are there generalizations that we can make?
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.020]   Or is it really all just about
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:57.580]   not getting excessive calories
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.900]   and trying to get those calories
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.500]   from the most nutrient-rich sources?
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.460]   Well, just drilling in on two things you just said there.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:05.980]   So one thing you said that was interesting
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.020]   was that you're lucky that you like all of those foods.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.340]   And then the second thing was,
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.080]   is it just about not getting excess calories?
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.420]   But I think what's interesting about both of those
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:19.180]   is that I would argue that the reason you like those foods
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.000]   is because you have given your body enough whole real foods
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.380]   that now everything in your biology, neurobiologically,
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:30.480]   your reward circuitry, your microbiome,
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.060]   your satiety hormone threshold,
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.060]   all of these are now basically creating a situation
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.580]   in which you like those foods.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.860]   And then the caloric thing fits into that
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.780]   because the reason we're eating excess calories,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.180]   the reason chronic nutrition is happening,
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:49.180]   and the reason we are quite literally in the United States
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:52.680]   eating ourselves to death for the first time
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.940]   in human history is because we're not eating real food.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.620]   And we're eating 60 to 75% of our calories
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:06.080]   of ultra processed nutrient depleted foods
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   that fundamentally don't give ourselves what they need.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:15.580]   And a real premise that I think is so important to realize
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.700]   is that our cells are brilliant.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.880]   And if the cells aren't getting what they actually need
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.840]   to function properly, they will drive you to eat
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.720]   until they get their needs met.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.640]   Unfortunately, because the ultra processed food
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.880]   is designed to be highly addictive,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.120]   and it's devoid of what the cells actually need
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.080]   for good function, we end up eating ourselves into a grave.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.280]   And now almost 80% of Americans are overweight or obese,
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.960]   close to 50% of the country is obese.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.000]   We literally gloss over this as a culture.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   It has become so normal in such a short amount of time.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.200]   But I always think about the fact that like,
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.760]   there are really no other animal species in the world
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.160]   that have obesity and chronic disease epidemics.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.200]   And they don't have social media,
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.980]   they don't have experts, they don't have PubMed,
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.480]   they don't have the FDA, they don't have the USDA,
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.320]   they don't have any of it.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.280]   And they have somehow figured out a way
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.240]   to stay at a healthy weight and to not get heart disease.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.280]   And it's because they're eating real food
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.000]   that meets the needs of their cells.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.400]   And so I think to just boil that down,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.160]   the root cause of the problem
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.680]   is that we have a toxic food supply
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.460]   that's no longer filled with the molecular information
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.720]   that our body needs to know to be satiated
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.580]   and to function properly.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:39.340]   And so through the complex biology of satiety hormones
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:42.320]   and neurobiology and microbiome function,
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.820]   we are driven to eat so, so, so much more.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:49.380]   So truly the jumping off point for anyone
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.580]   on the quest to better health is to eat
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:57.580]   as much real unprocessed food from good soil as possible.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.540]   And of really of any dietary philosophy they want.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:04.540]   Truly, I think if someone's eating real unprocessed food
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:09.020]   from good soil who is plant-based or who is keto,
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.660]   they are gonna have such a higher chance
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.740]   of meeting their body's actual fundamental needs.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.380]   And the good thing about biomarker testing
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.740]   is they can track for themselves
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.700]   if they are having good cellular function.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.380]   And with that strategy,
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.780]   there's been studies that have panned this out.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.700]   We know that the more ultra-processed food you eat,
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.580]   the higher risk of obviously obesity,
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:27.780]   but also chronic diseases are.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.680]   But then of course, there's an amazing study
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.220]   from Kevin Hall just recently
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:34.140]   where he basically locked people up at the NIH
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.180]   and for two weeks he had them eat ultra-processed food
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.620]   and for two weeks he had them eat real food.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.620]   And people ate 7,000 more calories in the two-week period
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:46.860]   when they were eating ultra-processed food
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.920]   versus the unprocessed food.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.420]   - They were locked at the NIH?
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.560]   - I mean-- - I've been to NIH
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.400]   quite a bit.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.980]   It's great for a day job or a day visit.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.260]   I don't know that I wanna be locked there.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:01.300]   That sounds like the Stanford Prisoner Experiment.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.660]   - I say this tongue-in-cheek and with such admiration
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.500]   for what he had to do,
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.100]   but I think it's so amusing that we have this
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:10.340]   totally frankenfood toxic food system
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.220]   that's largely ultra-processed.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.220]   And it took amazing Kevin Hall
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.940]   to basically do an NIH-funded study
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.540]   where people, what I say by locked
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.980]   is that they were inpatients at the NIH
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:27.100]   and every, had ad lib, unlimited access to food
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.420]   during each of those two-week interventions.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.100]   So it was two weeks of ultra-processed food,
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.780]   two weeks of unprocessed or minimally processed food.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.260]   And they could eat whatever they wanted,
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.600]   as much as they wanted in both groups,
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.740]   and then they would weigh every single bite
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.060]   that was left on their trays.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.220]   So they knew exactly, exactly how many calories they ate.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.980]   And literally just giving people this ultra-processed food,
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.300]   which is devoid of what our bodies need
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:55.940]   and therefore will drive people to eat more.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.260]   They ate 500 calories more per day
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:02.280]   for a total of 7,000 calories more in that two weeks.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.860]   And they gained about two pounds
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.620]   and then lost two pounds in the unprocessed group,
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.620]   which makes sense, of course,
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.660]   'cause a pound is about 3,500 calories.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:14.140]   And so we have to do these kind of crazy studies
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.500]   just to prove what we kind of know is true,
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.700]   which is that this ultra-processed food environment
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.820]   that's cropped up for the past 50 years
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.980]   is an experiment that has failed.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.420]   It has failed.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:27.580]   Close to 45% of kids are overweight or obese now.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:31.180]   It's not working, and that really is the root cause.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.100]   So I think a lot of food is about quality
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:39.100]   and how do we actually really meet the needs of the cells
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:41.100]   that our satiety hormones get secreted
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.900]   and we naturally stop eating?
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.500]   'Cause just telling people eat less calories
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:50.100]   but eat whatever you want, that just doesn't work.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.980]   We have to inspire the body
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.460]   to not want to eat excess calories,
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   which we do by stimulating satiety hormones,
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:03.660]   helping the microbiome support that process
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.140]   and then change our reward circuitry,
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.980]   which is done with nutrient-rich,
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:10.580]   the most nutrient-rich food we can possibly get.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.780]   And that's why I mentioned the soil,
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.220]   because our food is drastically depleted of nutrients.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.540]   So when we look at that 70 metric tons of food
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:20.500]   we're eating in a lifetime, it's just fasting.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.060]   That's the information for our body,
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.060]   what it's gonna be built from, how it's gonna function.
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:29.180]   Well, right now, 60 to 75% is ultra-processed,
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.460]   so we slash the value,
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.740]   'cause the ultra-processing just slashes the nutrients.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:35.860]   We slash the value of that 70 metric tons.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.660]   And then we have crappy soil,
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.340]   'cause our industrial agriculture system,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.300]   which means the food in some cases
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.780]   has 70% less of key micronutrients in it.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.180]   So that 70 metric tons,
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:48.820]   what's actually useful for our body
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:51.780]   becomes so much smaller.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.420]   So what we wanna do is basically expand the value
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.980]   of that substrate we're putting in the body.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:01.020]   And that means real food, unprocessed, from good soil,
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.820]   meet the needs of the cells, naturally don't be hungry,
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.140]   maintain a healthy weight.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:09.380]   And something I talk about is that we could,
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:10.540]   I mean, we could talk about nutrition,
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:11.900]   the biochemistry of nutrition all day,
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:16.900]   but in my review of the biology and the biochemistry,
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.460]   there's five main things I think we can strive for
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.500]   in our food that can really help
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.500]   meet the needs of our cells.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.020]   And when it really comes,
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.780]   there are obviously more things our body needs,
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.420]   but if we strive for these five things,
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.620]   we will ultimately, I think, eat a really healthy diet.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:36.620]   And that is fiber, omega-3s, adequate healthy protein,
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:41.580]   a good amount of probiotics and high antioxidant sources.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:45.380]   And if we build our diet around knowing a few things
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.380]   in each of those categories that we really love
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.580]   and stock our kitchen with it
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:50.700]   and make our meals a mixing and matching
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.660]   of each of those components,
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.260]   and we get a good amount of those,
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:57.740]   we will give the body a lot of what it needs
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.140]   to have mitochondrial health, reduce chronic inflammation,
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.020]   reduce oxidative stress.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:05.260]   - It's interesting for me to take a step back
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:08.500]   from nutrition as it's typically presented
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.980]   and think about the brain, the hypothalamic circuitry
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:14.820]   that drives hunger and satiety and things like that.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:17.380]   And to map that onto what I've heard,
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.380]   and I believe to be true based on my view of the literature,
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.980]   which is that we are largely,
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.700]   meaning these circuits in the brain
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:28.700]   make us largely amino acid foraging machines
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.140]   because we need those amino acids
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.540]   in order to carry out metabolic processes
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:36.340]   and reconstruct any tissues that need repair and recovery,
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:39.200]   not just from exercise, but just daily turnover,
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.640]   removal of waste, et cetera.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:46.500]   So we're foraging for amino acids unconsciously.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.980]   We're foraging for micronutrients.
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:51.060]   And of course we need macronutrients.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.980]   We need enough energy from proteins, fats,
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:56.320]   and carbohydrates, or some either combination of the three.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.340]   I feel like I'm sort of in the dying category of omnivores,
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:02.020]   right, I'm neither, you know, I'm not meat-based
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.780]   and I'm not plant-based, I'm an omnivore.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.340]   I think most people are omnivores actually,
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:09.740]   but omnivores aren't discussed quite as much
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.600]   as the other categories, at least not on social media.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.860]   But that, you know, where we think of ourselves
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.700]   as getting hungry and wanting to eat.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:21.700]   And I think eating the food,
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.700]   some of them that I listed off before,
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.060]   like meat and fish and eggs and vegetables and fruits,
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.740]   and some, I do like starches, like rice, oatmeal,
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.220]   some pastas, some sourdough breads and things.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.640]   I love butter, who doesn't love butter?
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.980]   Of course, none of that stuff in excess, olive oil.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.980]   But if one looks at kind of that buffet of options,
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.460]   you realize you can get some high-quality amino acids,
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.780]   you can get some high-quality lipids.
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:50.260]   You probably wanna get more of them from olive oil
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.700]   than from butter, but you can get the micronutrients
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.220]   you need provided those food sources are healthy.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.780]   Now contrast that with a highly processed diet
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.960]   or even a minimally processed diet,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.500]   and you can get the taste, you can get the macronutrients,
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.220]   you can get the calories, but you don't,
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.900]   meaning the brain doesn't really have a sense of,
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:13.340]   it can't directly map taste, calories, micronutrients
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.540]   onto one another.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:18.180]   And so you can imagine that the neural circuits,
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:21.220]   and here is a little bit of hypothesizing/conjecture,
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.220]   but that the neural circuits responsible for hunger
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:26.980]   and satiety would get immensely confused
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:30.300]   by what's in a highly processed food, right?
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.220]   A Snickers bar, if you like sweets, tastes pretty good,
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.620]   but it's unclear what's in it, except sugar,
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:39.220]   except it's got a certain Snickers bar taste, right?
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.260]   But if the circuits of the brain are really trying
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.380]   to drive us to get amino acids and micronutrients
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:51.220]   for bodily health and repair, well then highly processed
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:53.180]   and even moderately processed food
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.460]   has just got to be pure confusion.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:58.260]   I'm sorry to go long here, but it reminds me
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.820]   of an idea I had once where like,
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.620]   imagine if you took a pill that greatly increased
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:06.620]   the level of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine,
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.220]   and serotonin all at once, that's polypharmacology.
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.620]   And it might make you feel a certain way,
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.180]   maybe good, maybe bad, and then afterwards,
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.540]   you'd probably have a bit of a crash
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.160]   from as the drug wore off, no doubt you would.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.900]   But let's say you wanted more of that feeling,
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.420]   you wouldn't really know what to go look for
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.580]   because you don't know what was in it
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.100]   because it's polypharmacology.
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.560]   So I feel like highly processed food is polypharmacology.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.580]   Whereas when you are eating foods
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.100]   that create a more pure experience of micronutrients,
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:36.460]   amino acid content, calories, and taste,
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.420]   those four things map to one another,
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.500]   that intuitively we can start to understand,
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.000]   oh, I like this food and it's good for me,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.260]   and this is enough of it, right?
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.600]   I don't know anyone of reasonable size
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.280]   that eats like four ribeye steaks, they eat one.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.320]   I mean, I'm sure there's some freaks out there that do that,
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.320]   but one, even small piece of quality meat is very satiating.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.020]   - Yeah, you will self-regulate 'cause the body,
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.320]   like every other animal in the world,
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:09.560]   is exquisitely designed to regulate hunger
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.560]   on a very intuitive level if we eat natural food.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.360]   It's, you know, I think it's almost ridiculous
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.820]   to talk about calories in isolation
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.580]   because the reason we're eating more calories
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:26.060]   is because we're eating ultra processed food.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:29.220]   And so, but I love what you just said, Andrew,
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.060]   about the brain and the polypharmacy.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.860]   I think that literally is, I've never heard that said,
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.760]   and I think it's like processed food
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.300]   is like polypharmacy of food.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.420]   It is the definition of processed food,
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.020]   which I know you talked about with Rob Lustig,
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.340]   the NOVA4 criteria, is literally,
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:47.880]   it's breaking down foods into these constituent parts
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.080]   that were never meant to be separated from each other,
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.420]   like the endosperm of a wheat kernel,
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.880]   separate from the bran and the, you know, the germ,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.600]   and then take that and like a little science experiment,
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.180]   pair it up with all these other individual components
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.980]   and synthetic chemicals that are made in a factory
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.820]   and put them together to create this thing that the body,
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:12.000]   I truly think our insatiable hunger,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.900]   again, we're eating ourselves to death in the United States.
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:16.340]   That's the reality.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.340]   Our insatiable hunger and our chronic disease epidemic
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.940]   fundamentally is a lot of, it's mass cellular confusion.
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.620]   And when you think about what chronic inflammation is,
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:30.140]   chronic inflammation is biochemical fear
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.460]   on the cellular level.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.400]   Well, when you put this stuff into the body
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.980]   that's never seen before,
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:37.660]   obviously that's gonna generate some confusion.
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.020]   And, you know, you could trace that back
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.740]   to what that really means with leaky gut
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:44.920]   and, you know, all the sorts of the real physiology of that.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.560]   But there's a wonderful book
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.220]   that is called "The End of Cravings" by Mark Schatzer.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.620]   He also wrote "The Dorito Effect,"
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.440]   but he talks a little bit about what you're talking about,
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.040]   which is this ideal that processed food
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.040]   is actually the ultimate sort of food-based variable reward.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.480]   So in the way that it, in like things that,
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.100]   I mean, I'm speaking back expert here,
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.040]   but things that the body can't predict
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.200]   what the outcome is gonna be
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.240]   are gonna kind of get you in that dopamine motivation pathway
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.280]   and that's actually what processed food is doing
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.320]   is it's every time we eat a different,
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.600]   we think we're eating a tortilla,
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.120]   but it's like completely different
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.720]   than all the other weird tortillas,
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.020]   ultra-processed tortillas on the shelf.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.600]   So every time we eat tortilla
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.980]   and our brain is this incredible prediction machine,
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.960]   and as it's coming towards our mouth,
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.920]   we're predicting what the load is gonna be,
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.040]   but we have no idea.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.000]   Is it a Coke Zero?
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.680]   Is it a Diet Coke with aspartame?
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.760]   Is it a regular Coke?
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.160]   It all tastes the same,
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.520]   but the nutrients that are in our gut are totally different.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.680]   So we end up actually triggering the motivation pathways
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.680]   because of processed food representing a variable reward,
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.420]   whereas every time you eat a ribeye,
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:57.080]   your body's pretty much getting a similar thing each time,
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.080]   and so the prediction matching is gonna be more conducive
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:07.260]   to getting off the motivation treadmill for more,
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.900]   which I think is so fascinating.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.520]   But I think backing up a little bit,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.920]   one concept I have for food that really helps me
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.180]   is really thinking about
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.520]   the body's always trying to help me be satiated
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.280]   and trying to help reduce my cravings.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.080]   I literally just have to give the body what it needs.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.040]   I have to stimulate the body in a way that it will serve me
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.760]   and giving me satiety hormones
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.240]   to basically regulate my hunger.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.560]   And again, with visuals, I think it's so helpful.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.900]   I think about these cells lining our small intestine
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.100]   that literally have nutrient sensors
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.100]   and literal receptors on the cell membrane
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.860]   in the luminal side of the gut that's facing all the food
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.300]   that are just sitting there waiting to bind
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:53.400]   with these things in our food that will stimulate the cell
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.920]   to make the satiety hormone
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.720]   that poof, effortlessly makes us not hungry,
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.340]   gets rid of that grip of attachment to cravings
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:02.700]   that all of us are so plagued by.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:07.280]   And I think we have this intense conversation
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.080]   happening in society right now about GLP-1 analogs
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.380]   and Ozempic and Menjara and all these things, GLP-1 agonists.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.360]   But we rarely talk about the fact
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:19.440]   that we have nutrient sensing cells of the gut,
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.740]   the L-cells of the gut,
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.160]   that when stimulated appropriately will make GLP-1.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.680]   And when stimulated the way they want to be
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.600]   will secrete hordes of GLP-1 for us.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.480]   And so how do we actually think about
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.280]   just literally giving the body what it needs
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.020]   to stimulate the satiety hormones?
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.120]   And the processed foods aren't giving us those things.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:42.120]   The things that are gonna stimulate those cells,
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.740]   well, the things that will,
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:44.840]   I mean, this is kind of fascinating
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.280]   if you don't mind going down a little road.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.840]   No, please, please.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.580]   With the GLP-1 conversation,
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.080]   I feel like so missing from the conversation
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.560]   is the idea that from a first principles perspective,
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.760]   there's three ways our body could make more GLP-1.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.920]   We make more cells that make it, L-cells of the gut.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.600]   Each of those cells makes more GLP-1.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.560]   And importantly, we can also inhibit the inactivator
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.320]   of GLP-1, which is an enzyme called DPP-4.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.280]   So GLP-1 actually gets rapidly degraded
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.020]   by DPP-4 in the body.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.840]   So if we can figure out how to inhibit DPP-4,
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.320]   we can raise our GLP-1 levels.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.820]   - What is DPP-4?
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.960]   - It's an enzyme that breaks down GLP-1 rapidly.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.080]   - I think you said that and I missed it, I apologize.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.400]   - It's so fascinating.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.440]   And so how often have you seen in the headlines,
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.000]   oh, here's some strategies to inhibit your DPP-4?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   Never, because Ozempic is on track
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.920]   to be the highest grossing med in human history.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.000]   And just like we talked about in the beginning of the episode
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.920]   the whole industry,
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.720]   this $4 trillion healthcare industry
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   is desperate for us to not understand
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.000]   how to do the things that drugs could do for us.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   So when we look at those three first principles approaches
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.400]   of how do we make more L-cells,
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.920]   get them to produce more GLP-1 from each L-cell
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.480]   and then inhibit the breakdown to the inhibition of DPP-4.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.300]   For the first one, we know that short chain fatty acids,
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.860]   which of course are the by-product
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:11.240]   of microbial fermentation of fiber in the diet,
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.360]   stimulates the differentiation of more L-cells in the gut.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.800]   So more short chain fatty acids, more L-cells.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:19.680]   - Can we translate that into support the gut microbiome?
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.500]   - Eat more fiber.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.340]   - Eat more fiber.
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:23.820]   And we had Justin Sonnenberg from Stanford
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.960]   on a world expert in gut microbiome
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.640]   and he was a big proponent of,
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.760]   based on work he's done with Chris Gardner
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.120]   and others at Stanford, so happens,
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.240]   of ingesting one to three servings
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.920]   of low sugar fermented foods each day.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.940]   Things like sauerkraut, kimchi.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.560]   Again, low sugar variety is probably best.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.400]   - Right, not kombucha.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.560]   - Yeah, maybe not.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.560]   You said not kombucha?
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.600]   - Yeah, 'cause that's gonna be like the highest sugar
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.200]   of the fermented foods, which people often go to,
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.040]   but now that's become soda.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.860]   - And often costly too.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.700]   And pretty costly.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.840]   The sauerkrauts, you can actually make your own sauerkraut.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.120]   Tim Ferriss had a great recipe for this
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.440]   in "The 4-Hour Chef."
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.760]   You have to be careful because you can create
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.640]   some unhealthy ferment.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.000]   You have to do it the way he describes.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.480]   So check out the recipe, it's online.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.660]   Or you can buy sauerkraut and the brines,
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.640]   drinking the brine off the sauerkraut
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.120]   or off seems to be good for the gut.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.240]   - That's such a great point,
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.200]   which is that ultimately we want the short-chain fatty acids,
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.100]   which is the medicine that the microbiome are making for us
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:26.940]   through the microbial fermentation process.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.800]   And we can basically do that in three ways.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.880]   One is we can eat more fiber, which is prebiotics.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.000]   We can also eat more polyphenols
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.840]   because we're now learning that the microbiome
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.240]   actually processes, they ferment polyphenols from our,
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.160]   which is basically, you'll find those in colorful fruits
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:47.000]   and vegetables, spices, teas, cocoa, things like that.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.400]   So fermentation of polyphenols and fiber
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.940]   to short-chain fatty acids, which then we absorb.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:56.820]   And then, like you just said, in a fermented food,
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.480]   the bacteria in that food will be making
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.900]   short-chain fatty acids by fermenting the food in there.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:02.880]   And then if we drink that,
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.700]   we're getting the short-chain fatty acids directly.
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:09.300]   So that's the kimchi, sauerkraut, Greek yogurt,
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:11.100]   kvass, which I'm obsessed with,
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.700]   which is like low-sugar kombucha.
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:14.820]   It's like made with fermenting beets, basically.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.660]   - That's good stuff.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:16.740]   - It's such good stuff.
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.180]   Miso, natto.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:19.020]   So that's one.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.340]   That has been shown to differentiate
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.020]   more L-cells in the gut.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.100]   We also know that people with type 2 diabetes
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.500]   have much fewer L-cells in the gut.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.800]   And it's hard to know what the causality is there,
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.140]   but I think a safe assumption is like,
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:34.140]   if we keep our blood sugar under better control
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.940]   and sort of stay out of that diabetic range,
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.000]   it probably lends itself.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.660]   I don't know what the chicken and the egg is there,
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.500]   but blood sugar stability, more L-cell differentiation.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:44.100]   And then actually ginseng has been shown
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:48.500]   to improve L-cell differentiation.
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.700]   So that's just sort of one set of things.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:55.320]   And I don't think the dose on ginseng has been settled,
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.900]   but very high antioxidant component plant.
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.460]   When we look at actually stimulating more GLP-1,
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.580]   you've talked about yerba mate, I think,
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.740]   having like a mild effect on GLP-1,
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:09.300]   but there's actually a lot of other things
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.540]   in the literature.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:13.620]   Protein, of course, very potently stimulates
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:14.980]   these nutrient receptor cells,
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:18.180]   and specifically like valine and glutamine
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:21.340]   seem to have a potent stimulatory effect on GLP-1.
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:24.380]   So you're gonna find that in like meat and turkey
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:26.940]   and eggs and things like that.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.140]   - What are your thoughts on supplementing L-glutamine?
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.340]   It's controversial.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:32.980]   I know that some people do it in an effort
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:34.580]   to relieve leaky gut,
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.740]   but there aren't any randomized control trials for that.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.560]   So depending on one stance on what's required
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.140]   for kind of a threshold for adopting something,
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.540]   some people will say that's crazy.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.300]   Other people really swear by supplementing L-glutamine.
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.620]   Maybe it's through this route of increasing L-cells
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.740]   that some of the gut relief might exist.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:57.880]   I guess we'd have to explore it.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.340]   So that's speculative, folks.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:01.220]   So this is interesting.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:04.060]   These are ways to increase the cells that then make GLP-1.
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:07.380]   So fiber, prebiotic, probiotic fiber, and fermented foods.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.360]   - Antioxidants, lowering blood sugar, ginseng.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.360]   So those are kind of the L-cell ones.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.780]   The actual secretion of more GLP-1,
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.660]   one of the most potent ones,
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.100]   and the study that looks at this,
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.220]   like the bar graphs are very clearly
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.700]   statistically significant, lots of asterisks,
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.460]   is actually thylakoids.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.220]   - Thylakoids, tell me more about thylakoids.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.980]   - Thylakoids are so fascinating.
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:33.220]   Thylakoids are actually a structure in plants
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.420]   that are part of the chloroplasts.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:38.180]   So chloroplasts, and this also is fascinating
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.100]   'cause chloroplasts are basically the plant version
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.220]   of mitochondria, essentially.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:45.220]   And thylakoids are a molecule in the chloroplasts.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:46.820]   And there's actually been research that shows
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:50.840]   that when you eat about 100 grams of spinach,
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   which gives you five grams of straight thylakoid
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.220]   over 12 weeks daily, it led to a significant increase
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.740]   in GLP-1, and again, I don't remember the exact,
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:06.160]   it was two or three-fold higher secretion.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.420]   So this is in part, so that's a direct stimulatory effect
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:13.260]   of the L-cells, and so this equates
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.760]   to 3.5 ounces of spinach a day, which is like nothing.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.980]   So just getting those-- - Raw spinach
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:18.820]   or cooked spinach?
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:21.020]   - I think, I actually, I don't think it actually,
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:24.100]   it might've said in the methods, but I would imagine raw
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:28.460]   because you wanna get those undenatured thylakoids
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.540]   in the gut.
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.500]   So just kind of another, and actually thylakoids
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.860]   do a lot of other interesting stuff.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.740]   They inhibit lipase in the gut,
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:38.180]   and so actually help more fat get down
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:40.480]   to the distal small bowel and promote satiety.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.780]   So this is one of the reasons why you talk about,
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:45.260]   oh, the people who eat all these healthy foods and greens,
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:46.100]   they're less hungry.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.860]   It's like, it's biochemistry.
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.500]   There's stuff happening in there
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.460]   that is making the hunger signals go down
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.820]   through things like inhibiting lipase,
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.340]   improving GLP-1 secretion.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:01.500]   So other things for GLP-1 secretion, the thylakoids,
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:04.180]   also fiber's been shown, specific amino acids,
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.420]   so high-protein foods, things that involve a lot
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:09.300]   of valine and glutamine, green tea,
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:14.300]   and specifically the ECGC
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:16.680]   that is one of the compounds in green tea,
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.460]   that's been shown to stimulate GLP-1, curcumin.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.340]   So there's several things that are all in that whole food,
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:27.600]   basically things you would associate with a healthy diet,
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.460]   but we actually know they stimulate GLP-1.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.740]   So those are all things I try to include in my diet.
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:34.120]   And the last one is inhibition of DPP-4.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.020]   And that one, there's just actually,
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:37.020]   when you look at the research,
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.480]   there's some kind of random foods
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:43.480]   that tend to inhibit DPP-4, black beans, Mexican oregano,
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.700]   other forms of oregano, rosemary, guava,
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.460]   and I wrote this one down
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.940]   'cause it's a word I hadn't seen very much
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:54.100]   before I started digging into this, but muricetin,
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.100]   which is found in berries, cranberries,
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.100]   and peppers, and Swiss chard.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.300]   So all that is to say,
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:05.680]   ultimately, many of us are gripped by cravings.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.680]   And the idea of just not being constantly driven to eat more,
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:16.940]   which I would argue that about 80% of Americans are,
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:18.980]   feels really hard to overcome.
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:22.700]   But a lot of it is literally just communicating to yourselves
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:27.220]   in a clear way through food to help you be satiated.
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:29.620]   And the science can show us how to do this.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.700]   And a lot of it comes down to eating,
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.420]   essentially, what you were talking about,
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:35.560]   how you eat omnivorous protein,
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.720]   healthy sources with nutrient density,
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:44.320]   and lots of colorful fruits, vegetables,
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.960]   spices, herbs, things like that.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.200]   So, yeah.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.440]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.520]   Again, these aren't randomized controlled trials,
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.720]   nor are they peer-reviewed studies,
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.920]   but I have a few friends who I've known for most of my life
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.080]   who really struggled with their weight,
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.440]   carried a lot of excess weight,
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.900]   and were starting to suffer health issues in their,
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.080]   even their 30s, but in their 40s.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:09.460]   I'm 48, so they're my peers,
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.380]   and so they're about that age range.
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:15.180]   And they've all done extremely well,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:18.940]   meaning they lost a tremendous amount of body fat,
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:21.140]   are terrifically healthy now,
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:25.100]   by way of basically restricting their food intake
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:30.100]   to protein, so fish and meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.700]   They basically just cut out starches,
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.420]   but I don't think it was the starches per se.
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.660]   I think it was the satiety that comes from eating
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.320]   high-quality protein, fruits and vegetables,
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:46.460]   and from limiting the number of highly processed foods.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.060]   And actually the toughest thing for all of them
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:51.800]   was to stop asking me, or themselves,
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.100]   rather, like, can I include this condiment, this, this?
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.140]   And what's interesting is all of them now
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:01.060]   seem to really enjoy eating foods in their more pure form.
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.340]   And I'm not somebody that, like, pushes this on my friends.
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.740]   They just come to me and say, like,
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:09.220]   how do I lose 50 pounds without having to exercise
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:14.100]   it all off, you know, as the only source of weight loss?
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.540]   They all exercise as well, but it's just so daunting
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:20.100]   to try and lose, you know, 20, 30, 40 pounds,
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:22.080]   and to do so quickly, and then to keep it off,
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.860]   'cause they've all had the experience of going on a diet,
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:26.340]   and then, you know, exercising a lot.
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.000]   The point here is that I really think
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.060]   there's something powerful about that relationship
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:33.820]   between taste, macronutrient value,
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.540]   micronutrient value, and satiety.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:39.660]   I think there's really those powerful associations
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.920]   because the brain is such an associative machine.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.020]   One thing that I should have said before,
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:47.620]   and I know most people are familiar with Ozempic,
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:51.740]   and its commercial names are, I forget what the-
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.620]   - Ozempic is the commercial name,
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:56.060]   and Mungiaro, and Mugovi, and yeah.
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.860]   - Got it, is that GLP-1 acts more or less
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:02.760]   as an appetite suppressant, powerful appetite suppressant.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:07.760]   So many millions of people are now taking GLP-1 analogs,
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.820]   is that right?
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.580]   - I think there were over 20 million prescripts
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.660]   in the United States last year.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.860]   - Is it expensive?
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.300]   - It's $20,000 per year.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.260]   - Does insurance cover it, typically?
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:23.220]   - Right now, insurance is covering it for indications,
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:25.500]   but there is a all-out assault
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:29.540]   from the pharmaceutical industry
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:33.900]   to essentially classify obesity as a genetic disease
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:37.340]   and a chronic disease in order to be able
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:42.340]   to feed this medication more into the insurance pathway,
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:44.660]   and essentially get more taxpayer dollars
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:46.280]   to pay for this medication.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.260]   And it is extremely expensive,
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:52.260]   and it's on track to be the highest grossing medication
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:55.980]   in human history because it's now being recommended
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:58.380]   for people with obesity, type 2 diabetes,
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:01.540]   and then the American Academy of Pediatrics recently
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.500]   has talked about giving this to children as young as 12
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:08.660]   as part of the first line for overweight.
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:13.300]   And I think really it's such a travesty
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.980]   based on the conversation we've had,
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:20.180]   because what Ozempic does not do in any way, shape, or form
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.860]   is impact the toxic environment that we're living in
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.660]   that's hurting our mitochondria.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.060]   Losing weight is different
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.900]   than improving mitochondrial function,
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.140]   and mitochondrial dysfunction is the root cause
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:33.940]   of basically every chronic illness and symptom
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.680]   that's torturing American lives today.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.380]   And so in many ways, it represents the ultimate Band-Aid
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:43.680]   for an environment that is not changing.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.240]   And when you think about what we could do
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:52.240]   with $20,000 per year, and it's a weekly injection.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.020]   So people will say, "Well, per person."
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.600]   Like, oh, and it's a medication
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:59.300]   that is intended to be taken for life,
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.700]   because when people come off this medication,
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:05.280]   many people are gaining back all of the weight
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:07.300]   or even more weight afterwards.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.580]   And then there's been conversations,
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:12.340]   Peter Atiyah is waiting on this, about loss in lean mass.
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:15.040]   Part of the weight loss is disproportionately muscle.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:18.020]   And so there's a lot of concerns about it
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:19.540]   above and beyond its ability
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.100]   to lower the number on the scale
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.360]   that we should all be very alert to,
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.060]   because the reality is that the 40 trillion cells
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:30.480]   in our body are in an environment
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.840]   in the Western world right now
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.720]   that is not conducive to core biologic functioning.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:39.380]   And there is obviously no shot
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:44.380]   that can mitigate the multi-front assault on our biology
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:47.060]   that ultimately generates a body
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.460]   that's immensely profitable
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.660]   for those 100 specialties of healthcare.
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:55.100]   So we're living in this matrix and this game
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:58.740]   of a devil's bargain between a $4 trillion healthcare
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:54:59.700]   and pharmaceutical industry
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:02.060]   and a $6 trillion processed food industry
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:06.260]   that all want us to think that the answer is found in a shot
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.940]   and we don't need to change anything about our lifestyle.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.300]   But of course, these simple habits
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.960]   that we're talking about, eating real food,
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.280]   moving, walking, et cetera, getting out in the sunlight,
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.980]   rapidly can increase our mitochondrial capacity
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:22.980]   and are just the most disruptive thing that we can do
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:25.660]   in our culture today is learn about metabolic health
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:26.500]   and improve it.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.500]   And it's just interesting to see what's happening
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.980]   in the media with sort of the assault
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.140]   against these empowering habits
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:37.900]   and very in favor of a medication like Ozempic.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:40.980]   And then when you trace, unfortunately, incentives there,
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.540]   a huge percentage of these outlets
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:45.900]   that cover Ozempic as a miracle drug,
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:49.100]   their bills are paid by pharma, 60% of mainstream media
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:50.500]   advertising budget is pharma.
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:55.500]   And so, I just say that because I think it's a scandal
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.340]   that we give so much airtime to these medications
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.140]   and not to simple metabolic habits
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:04.020]   that can make us feel so incredible
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:06.180]   and really change our core biology.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:09.100]   - So walking, exercise, eating minimally processed
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:10.540]   or non-processed foods.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:14.380]   You also mentioned temperature.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.220]   - Yeah.
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.180]   I'm very interested in that.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:19.000]   But before we go a little bit further down the path
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.420]   of what one can do in terms of having agency
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.820]   over their metabolic health,
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:27.500]   I just feel obligated to just entertain the possibility,
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.700]   presumably somebody who's really struggled
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.380]   with their weight a long time,
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:34.180]   maybe because of excess cravings,
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:37.540]   challenges in regulating their appetite or whatever.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:39.540]   We don't know what the reasons are.
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:41.740]   Maybe they injured their knee and they can't exercise.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:43.420]   I mean, this happens, right?
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:44.280]   At least not yet.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.440]   Take a GLP analog like Osempic.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.240]   Loses some weight, probably loses some muscle also.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.200]   One would hope that that would give them the sense of,
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.640]   okay, now I can move my body better.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.760]   I'll start exercising, eating better as well.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.080]   I think that I have to imagine
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.480]   that there's a middle case condition
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.720]   where people are not just relying on pharmaceuticals
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.520]   and not just relying on behavioral routes
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.840]   to improve metabolic health, but can do both, right?
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.400]   I mean, and one would hope they are
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.040]   if they're already taking these meds.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.040]   Or is it the case that when people have a pill
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.720]   or an injection or a potion that it gives them
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.360]   the effect that they want, that they just remain sedentary?
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.520]   - I think we have to look at history here.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.160]   I mean, first of all,
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.720]   there have been other weight loss medications
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.760]   throughout history that you've talked about in the podcast,
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.520]   like the Fen-Phen, and then there was another one,
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.760]   I think even before that,
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:36.860]   that made people, their temperature go up,
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:37.700]   that you've talked about.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.520]   - Okay, yeah, so the two of these are,
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.640]   I used to work on thermal regulation as an undergrad.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.720]   So Fen-Phen was eventually banned
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.860]   because it caused some cardiac issues.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.320]   I believe it was a stimulant, fenfluramine.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.380]   Sorry, it's not fenfluramine alone.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.680]   It's a combination of things.
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.280]   That's why it's called Fen-Phen.
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:57.280]   And then dinitrophenol, which was based on the observation
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.460]   that workers in ammunitions factories
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:01.840]   were being exposed to this stuff
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.600]   and losing a lot of body fat and weight.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.180]   It actually made its way into the sports community.
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:10.760]   It's highly deadly, highly deadly.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.920]   Don't even look it up, it's highly deadly.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.240]   Because the moment people start looking it up,
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.400]   they started thinking about dabbling
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.720]   the way the internet is now.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.080]   Dinitrophenol, and I think it has to do
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:27.080]   with sort of processing of the mitochondria.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:30.080]   I think this is happening in the electron chains
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:30.920]   in the mitochondria.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:34.660]   So anyway, free electron, look it up.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:37.340]   - Yeah. - Excuse me.
[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:41.580]   The bottom line here is that there've been plenty of drugs,
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:44.620]   mostly stimulants, used to help people lose weight.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:47.980]   And, or that have acted directly on the mitochondria.
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.340]   It has not worked out well, historically.
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:51.300]   - Right. - It just hasn't.
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:54.940]   - And I think that I'm not just gonna lump,
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:55.900]   it's a different mechanism.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:59.160]   So I don't wanna lump it in with past weight loss drugs.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:02.260]   However, if you look at the trends throughout history,
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:06.940]   the medicalization and pharmacology
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:11.220]   towards chronic issues has been an abject failure.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.780]   I can, I don't know of,
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.720]   and I'm sure people can correct in the comments,
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:18.460]   but of a single chronic condition
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.220]   for which the explosion of the pill
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.460]   to treat and manage that condition
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:25.940]   has lessened the rates of that condition.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:29.820]   The more SSRIs you prescribe, the more depression we have.
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.820]   The more metformin we prescribe,
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:34.940]   the more type two diabetes rates are going up.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:39.300]   The more Ozempic is being prescribed, obesity is going up.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:42.740]   You know, this is, on Wall Street, they're not,
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.220]   this is on track to be a blockbuster drug,
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:49.020]   and they're not assuming the rates of obesity
[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:50.140]   are gonna go down.
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.980]   That wouldn't actually make sense for the business model.
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:53.860]   I mean, these are being talked about
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.020]   at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conferences.
[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.820]   Do you think they're thinking that this is gonna plummet?
[01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:59.140]   No, like there are,
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:02.580]   I can't think of very many chronic conditions
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.140]   for which the explosion of the medication
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.260]   has reduced the frequency of the disease.
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:10.780]   That's really something to think about,
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.980]   and the reason is because of exactly
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:14.320]   what we started this conversation with.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.500]   They're not actually truly impacting
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:21.200]   or healing the root cause physiology.
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:23.040]   In some cases, they're worsening
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.260]   that root cause physiology,
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:26.140]   like they are inducing oxidative stress.
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:30.220]   They may help with the symptomatic management,
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:32.360]   but not actually reducing that trifecta
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:33.540]   that we talked about in the beginning,
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:35.940]   and so why do we have reason to believe
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:39.120]   that medicalizing obesity
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:42.180]   and not actually getting at the root cause,
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:47.100]   which has to be impacted by multimodal gentle nudges
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.720]   in our daily life habits and environment,
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.840]   that that's actually gonna reduce
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.540]   the rates of the condition, so.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:53.900]   - No, that's very helpful.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:56.860]   Okay, so I'll then return to the other question
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.260]   about temperature.
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:00.020]   What are some things that can do with temperature?
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:03.020]   And by the way, as I do this, I can't resist any longer.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:05.480]   Casey, Dr. Means brought me this jar of blueberries.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.320]   People that know me know
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.600]   that I'm a drive-by blueberry eater,
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.000]   so if there's blueberries out on a table,
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:11.840]   I'm gonna take some.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:14.160]   I've never eaten during a podcast,
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.600]   but I'm going to now, so I'll try and chew quietly.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.520]   Do you want some?
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:19.360]   - Sure.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.920]   - I love blueberries, and no, I don't eat them one by one,
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.320]   but I'm going to try and eat them quietly,
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.280]   so we'll keep them here in the middle for the time being,
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.680]   and I'm gonna eat them by the handful,
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:32.180]   just 'cause I got hungry.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.420]   And you mentioned berries earlier,
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.480]   and it triggered a neural circuit for me.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.720]   So what about temperature?
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:40.360]   People that know me, or even that just listen
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.040]   to the podcast know that I like the cold shower thing,
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.880]   cold plunge thing.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.780]   I don't do it every day.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:47.940]   I don't do it after resistance training workouts
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:50.960]   for at least six hours, and mostly keep it on days separate
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.560]   from the resistance training,
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.960]   because there are some data that can inhibit hypertrophy
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.240]   and strength adaptations.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.880]   But I like it.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:00.720]   I like it.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.960]   It feels good.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:04.100]   I feel great afterwards for many hours,
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:05.960]   and I believe there are some health effects,
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.960]   and I'm willing to weather the storm of naysayers,
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.420]   because more and more data keep emerging.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:14.300]   That's the case.
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.320]   Not all the data are spectacular.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:19.320]   One paper on this actually was just retracted.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:22.320]   We need to do an update to an episode to,
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.320]   it's not work from my lab,
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.960]   but I still think that there's a lot of really terrific work
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.720]   on deliberate cold exposure.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:31.040]   What's the deal with temperature and mitochondria?
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:34.160]   So no one has basically described this better than you.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.000]   I feel like on your platform,
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.240]   but I think about it very, very simply.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.480]   Throughout human history, humans have really,
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.880]   in so many different parts of the world,
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:47.320]   been exposed to hugely fluctuating temperatures.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.960]   Like if you look at the Sahara desert,
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.960]   or like a regular day in Colorado,
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:52.840]   it's like you can go from,
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:53.880]   let's talk about the Sahara desert.
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:56.120]   You can go from 30 degrees to 110 degrees
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.560]   in the span of one day.
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:59.940]   And like even the concept of indoors
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:03.680]   is like a relatively new concept in human history.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.280]   Four walls, you know, insulation,
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.200]   then central heating and cooling.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:11.960]   That's like the last 50, 75 years in most homes.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.160]   And so this idea,
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:18.120]   our cells have evolved to respond
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.520]   to big swings in temperature that very recently
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.640]   we have totally pulled away.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.080]   And I think that when I think about the mitochondria
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.320]   and increasing their capacity,
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.160]   I'm thinking about,
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.960]   well, how do I use different energetic signals
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:34.120]   in my environment to essentially get the mitochondria
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:35.680]   to do better work?
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:37.080]   And we can think about all the different types
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.320]   of energy that we're exposed to.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:41.440]   Solar energy, thermal energy, acoustic energy,
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.040]   mechanical energy, you know, food energy.
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:46.620]   Like that's basically what our environment is, right?
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:48.560]   And thermal energy is a big one of those.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.120]   We can speak to our mitochondria
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.680]   with the language of thermal energy and say,
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.460]   hey, it's cold outside.
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:00.600]   We need you to print more of yourselves or work harder
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.580]   such that we can create heat inside the body
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.320]   to respond to this stimulus.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.080]   And so that's kind of the framing that I use for it.
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.480]   And like, you know,
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.500]   this data is hard to know if it's totally accurate,
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:15.060]   but like our population is cooling.
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:17.960]   And some, I think it was data out of Stanford actually,
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.480]   that was showing that like our temperature
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.840]   has gone down like 2% or something like that
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.760]   in the last hundred years.
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.520]   And that fundamentally is mitochondria
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:27.480]   not working as well as they should.
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.480]   Research has shown we're making less ATP
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:30.460]   in a lot of our cells.
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:33.080]   And that's, you know, a function of mitochondrial dysfunction.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.080]   One fun fact, I don't know if you knew this,
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.480]   but the body makes about 88 pounds of ATP per day
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.480]   for like the average American.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:42.760]   So we're constantly making it,
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:45.800]   and we're constantly recycling it in this like, you know,
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.360]   like basically make it, use it, make it, use it, make it.
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.640]   So fast that like we essentially don't change our weight,
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:53.960]   but it's kind of, and of course, as it's being broken down,
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:55.820]   ATP to ADP, we release heat.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.680]   And so I just think of cold as like one of the tools
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:03.520]   in our tool belt to talk to the mitochondria to say,
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:05.760]   make more heat.
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.080]   And in a world in which our mitochondria are under siege,
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:10.520]   I think it's a valuable,
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:13.440]   often very inexpensive one that we can use.
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:16.880]   Of course, it does not supplement
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.000]   or replace food, sleep, exercise,
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.880]   but I think it can be a very valuable tool to stimulate,
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.000]   you know, through that signal to basically make more heat.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.520]   And, you know, we know, of course it can help.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.560]   And the data, you know, is mixed,
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.800]   but like increase brown fat,
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:35.360]   which is like mitochondrial dense fat
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.000]   and have it do more work and whatnot.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.560]   So ultimately brown fat is mitochondrial dense fat,
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:41.520]   and we wanna, you know, help promote that.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.700]   So that's how I use cold.
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.640]   And then on the heat side, you know,
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.440]   just fascinating how that's kind of acting
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.200]   to help metabolic health
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.980]   through the activation of the heat stock protein,
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.280]   some of which have, you know,
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.700]   the ability to upregulate antioxidant defense systems
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:56.700]   and quell some of that wildfire that we talked about
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:57.960]   that can hurt our mitochondria.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.840]   So I put them lesser on my list,
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.600]   but, you know, 'cause we just can't,
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:06.960]   we can't avoid the food and, you know,
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.380]   the sleep and the movement,
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:10.720]   but I think it's a great tool that we can use.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:11.560]   - I love it.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.560]   I will just point out that the reason the brown fat
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.700]   is brown at all is because of the density of mitochondria.
[02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:18.380]   It's literally brown down the microscope.
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.380]   This is not the kind of fat that is subcutaneous,
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:22.220]   although it, you know,
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:24.300]   it sits around the scapulae, neck, upper back.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:26.660]   There's other pockets of it on the body too.
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.600]   And such an interesting tissue.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.460]   Yeah, I don't know why deliberate cold exposure
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:32.320]   is so controversial.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:34.620]   I think it's because people who don't like it,
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.760]   and frankly, no one likes getting in it.
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:39.020]   The best part is getting out and how you feel afterwards.
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:43.160]   But I think nothing grates on people
[02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:44.440]   like deliberate cold exposure
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.960]   if they don't like deliberate cold exposure.
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:47.120]   And there's no requirement for it,
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.200]   but I think it's a very interesting stimulus.
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:51.680]   And I think there's also a very interesting relationship
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:52.720]   between light and temperature
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:55.080]   because in most areas of the world,
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:58.080]   as days get longer, meaning more sunlight available,
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.700]   temperatures go up.
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:02.040]   And nowadays we can really divorce ourselves
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.560]   from all this like day lengthening
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.880]   and shortening temperature fluctuations,
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:07.840]   which is not to say that we should all be running around
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:10.520]   in a minimal amount of clothing outdoors,
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:12.900]   but there's just such beautiful data
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:17.460]   from Dr. Susanna Soberg's work showing, for instance,
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:19.580]   that deliberate cold exposure
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:22.380]   then leads to one feeling more comfortable
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:23.220]   at cold temperatures
[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:26.300]   because you become essentially more of a furnace.
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.620]   - That's right. - More brown fat.
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.140]   Anyway, we could go on and on,
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:32.620]   but I think it's yet another lever of autonomy
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:34.900]   in terms of taking control of one's health.
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:39.900]   As you said, not as critical as food intake
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:43.200]   and quality amount and maybe timing as well.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.160]   Speaking of timing, what are your thoughts on fasting?
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:47.680]   And then of course, movement and exercise.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.640]   - The way I conceptualize the idea of fasting,
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:52.040]   obviously this is one where we need more words, right?
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.400]   Because the word fasting is so limited.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.520]   There's so many different parts of this, but-
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.600]   - Skipping breakfast for me would be that,
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:07:59.860]   or skipping dinner.
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:00.700]   Sometimes I'll skip dinner,
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:01.720]   sometimes I'll skip breakfast.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:02.560]   - Right.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.560]   I think that some of the most interesting data
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:08.800]   that I've seen has been about
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:13.800]   if we reasonably compress our eating into daytime hours
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.220]   during the part of the diurnal cycle
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:18.240]   when we are supposed to be eating,
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:23.160]   so essentially matching our chronobiology with our behavior,
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.480]   which we are diurnal organisms,
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:27.200]   so we kind of need to respect that.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:31.000]   Like when we do that and we compress it in a moderate way,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.880]   our metabolic health is better.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.120]   And so some of the studies that have looked at this,
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:37.800]   one that was interesting was,
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:39.560]   and I think very hopeful for people,
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.860]   is that if you take all the food,
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:44.280]   all the calories that you're gonna eat
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.960]   and eat them in a six-hour window versus a 12-hour window,
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.960]   totally same amount of calories, exact same food.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.560]   This is a controlled experiment.
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.680]   People who eat the same amount of calories
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.360]   in a six-hour period are gonna have much lower,
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.800]   statistically significantly lower glucose,
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:04.400]   24-hour glucose and insulin levels
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.000]   compared to people who just space it out
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.520]   over the course of a 12-hour period.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:12.600]   And it makes sense because if you're spacing that food out
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:14.600]   over the course of 12 hours,
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:17.640]   that is a different biochemical milieu
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:18.520]   in your body throughout the day.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.000]   It's kind of similar to the walking.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.060]   It's like you are then stimulating insulin
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:24.920]   several more times.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.760]   You are exposing the bloodstream to insulin and glucose
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.680]   just more throughout the day
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.760]   and giving the bloodstream less of an opportunity
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:38.440]   to just sort of be clear from that glucose and that insulin.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.520]   And so compressing our eating window
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:43.880]   seems to be helpful for metabolic health.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:45.520]   And it's a bang for your buck, right?
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.960]   Like you can eat the same amount of food.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.620]   You just have to eat in a shorter period of time.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.600]   So for people who wanna eat a lot,
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.440]   maybe just consider compressing it
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.680]   into daytime hours, six to eight-hour window.
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.040]   - Yeah, for me, six is tough.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.400]   Six is tough, yeah. - The one-meal-per-day thing
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:00.240]   is tough.
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:01.540]   I have friends like Lex Friedman
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:02.680]   that do the one-meal-per-day thing.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.760]   I end up eating so much food at that meal
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:08.000]   that I experience a lot of mechanical distress.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.520]   And it's typically later in the day.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.040]   I think an eight- to 10-hour window
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:13.660]   has worked well for me most days.
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:16.960]   I know as soon as we talk about intermittent fasting,
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.200]   which is what, or time-restricted feeding, same thing,
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.560]   which is what we're talking about right now,
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.320]   I'm sure somebody's gonna call up the,
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:27.520]   there's been a study that's been circulating
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:30.880]   about a massive increase in cardiovascular risk
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.760]   in people doing intermittent fasting,
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.800]   in particular, the six-hour feeding window.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:35.840]   I just wanna point out-
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:36.960]   - Worse study.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.720]   - As far as I know, I could be wrong,
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.200]   but as far as I know, that study is still in abstract form.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.880]   It's not yet peer-reviewed.
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.060]   It's like the fact that studies
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:48.800]   that haven't been peer-reviewed
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.680]   aren't even close to being peer-reviewed
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:53.600]   are being put out there as new stories.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.480]   It's really problematic
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.080]   'cause I can tell you as somebody
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.700]   who sat on the editorial boards
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:00.040]   of many journals for many years,
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.040]   I still sit on a few, reviewed countless papers,
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:04.840]   I've submitted and had to deal with reviews
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.400]   on countless papers.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.800]   The fact of the matter is until the reviews are done,
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.220]   the revisions are made,
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.240]   that paper may never see the light of day,
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.000]   and it may end up in a journal
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.120]   that is barely worthy of a placemat.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.220]   It might end up in a high-tier, high-quality journal,
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.060]   but it might not.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.560]   So just because there was, quote-unquote, a study done
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:26.400]   means very little, but it means especially little,
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:28.800]   maybe nothing until it's peer-reviewed.
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.260]   - Absolutely, and the methods were very poor in that study.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:33.560]   It was a recall-based study, I think,
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:37.320]   for two days of recall of people's diets,
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:40.300]   which is notoriously very bad in terms of accuracy.
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:43.080]   So yeah, and I think I'm not in any way suggesting
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:45.120]   that a six-hour window is the optimal window.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:47.440]   I'm just sharing the data that suggests
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.680]   that compressing the window
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:52.760]   seems to have a favorable effect,
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:54.600]   and I certainly don't do six hours,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:55.840]   but I think when you look at
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:57.960]   what the average American is doing,
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.720]   which is the average American has 11 eating events per day,
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.720]   and 50% of Americans eat over a 15-hour window per day.
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:10.560]   I can recall those because I remember
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.720]   when I was writing the book,
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:16.720]   I was like, that's a long time, 15 hours and 11 events,
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:18.720]   and every time you're doing that,
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:21.400]   you're going to be stimulating this glucose rise
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.080]   in the bloodstream, exposing the blood vessels
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:24.920]   to that glucose.
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:27.560]   You're gonna be turning on all the pathways with insulin
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.880]   to basically store it, and so it's strain for the body,
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:34.920]   and so I think giving the body times intentionally
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.540]   to allow insulin to come down
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:41.240]   and to allow glucose to come down,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.960]   what that does is it generates metabolic flexibility.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.960]   It gives our body an opportunity to have space
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.240]   to use accessible glucose
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.360]   and then convert into using stored fat,
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.520]   and that ultimately is metabolic flexibility,
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.760]   the ability for the body,
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:00.560]   giving the body opportunities to use glucose,
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.640]   but then have times when there's not high glucose
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.160]   and insulin around to actually get into the fat stores,
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:10.000]   and I think one of the reasons why we have
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.600]   such a massive overweight and obesity rates in the country
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.600]   is because with the way, the culture of eating right now,
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:19.800]   11 eating events per day,
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:21.880]   eating over the course of 15 hours per day,
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:23.960]   I would imagine the average American body
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:28.200]   is rarely, if ever, tapping into their fat stores
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.680]   for energy in a meaningful way
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:33.440]   because we always have glucose available to the body.
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.040]   If you think about, again,
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.640]   the stats about ultra-processed food,
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:40.400]   about 70% of the items on the shelves
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:41.840]   in the grocery store are ultra-processed food,
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:44.160]   and those ultra-processed foods are built on
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:46.920]   refined added sugars and refined added grains,
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:50.280]   so we very rarely give the body the opportunity to rest
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.520]   and move into fat burning,
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.880]   and that's where compressing the eating window
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.160]   can be valuable.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.520]   Obviously, people have talked about this before,
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.600]   but fasting can be a stressor for the body,
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.720]   especially if your body's not used to using fat for energy,
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:09.920]   and so it's something to ease into and go slow,
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:12.680]   but I think if you're slowing down enough
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:14.920]   to really hear what your body's signal are saying,
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.880]   you can kinda know whether I think your fasting
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:20.120]   is working for you or not.
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.640]   I can tell, if I've got too many other things going on,
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:25.240]   I haven't slept well, a lot of stress,
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.560]   I can tell that fasting's kinda making me jittery
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:29.520]   and not feel good versus if I'm really,
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.280]   if I have good capacity, I can feel
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.360]   that it's actually making me feel really incredible,
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:36.160]   and so tune in with your body, obviously,
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.720]   and you can check your biomarkers.
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.680]   If you have a CGM on,
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.280]   you can see what's happening in your glucose.
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:41.280]   If you have a ketone monitor,
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:42.720]   you can see what's happening in your ketones
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.760]   and really actually track,
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.200]   which I think makes fasting actually even more fun.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:49.480]   I'll mention one other piece of data
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:52.000]   that I think is actually really kinda fun as well
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.320]   with timing of eating.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.880]   There was a study that looked at people
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.880]   who ate the exact same meal at 9.30 a.m. or 8.30 p.m.,
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:03.560]   so basically after dark,
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.360]   essentially in the part of the diurnal phase
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.440]   when we probably shouldn't be eating
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:11.040]   versus early in the morning, 9.30,
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:13.280]   and the glucose and insulin responses
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:17.360]   for the same meal at 8.30 p.m. were significantly higher
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.240]   than when eating at 9.30 a.m.,
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:21.360]   and so again, bang for your buck.
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.520]   It appears that eating in that earlier part of the day
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:27.560]   when we're active and our chronobiology is set up
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.840]   for metabolism and activity,
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:33.880]   we have a lower glucose and insulin response.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:37.080]   There's also some evidence that melatonin,
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.800]   which is secreted as we get closer to sleep,
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:42.840]   has somewhat of an effect
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:45.440]   on impairing our insulin sensitivity transiently,
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:48.240]   and so we may actually just be not absorbing the glucose
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.360]   from those meals effectively later at night,
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:54.800]   so I tend to kinda move a little bit more low-carb,
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:57.400]   I would say, throughout the day based on that data
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.360]   and what I've seen on my continuous glucose monitor,
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.040]   basically just higher spikes
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.480]   for the same meal later in the day,
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:05.680]   so why not just kinda move it up earlier?
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:07.720]   - Very interesting, something I'll definitely try.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.440]   I tend to push my carbohydrates
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.000]   to a little bit later in the day for sake of sleep,
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.080]   unless, of course, I've done resistance training,
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.680]   which I aim to do three times a week,
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.840]   and post-resistance training,
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.960]   I try and get some starchy carbohydrate in me
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.360]   just to replenish glycogen,
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.480]   and that then tends to reduce
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:29.040]   my carbohydrate craving later in the day.
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.480]   I love bread and butter, bread and olive oil, pastas,
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:33.840]   and the other day I found this Argentine place,
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:34.800]   and I love the steaks there,
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.000]   but they had gnocchi that it took everything I had,
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.400]   every neural circuit that releases GABA
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:42.360]   in addition to my brain
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.480]   to not order three of those orders, it was so good.
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:46.800]   - But you can walk after the gnocchi.
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.120]   - Oh yeah, sure, I'll allow myself to do those things.
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:50.200]   I'm not super restricted,
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.400]   but again, I tend to eat high-quality foods.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.680]   By the way, these blueberries are amazing.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.840]   Then you figure out where you got those
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.040]   'cause they're just tangy enough.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:00.160]   I'm doing everything I can to just not take the jar
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.520]   and funnel them into my mouth.
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.720]   Yeah, I think if we're looking at blood sugar,
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.800]   blood glucose, and insulin,
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:13.280]   and as long as we're talking about that,
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.360]   I did use a levels tracker, and yeah, full disclosure,
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.340]   they're a sponsor of the podcast regularly,
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.360]   and I learned a ton.
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:21.600]   I'll tell you what I learned.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:26.600]   I learned that, indeed, my blood sugar goes up after I eat,
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:28.480]   that certain foods,
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:31.500]   although the foods that did this surprised me,
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:37.440]   certain foods tend to spike my blood sugar quite a bit.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:40.080]   Grapes, that shouldn't be surprising.
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.840]   Food order was very powerful for me.
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:47.080]   I know that the data on food order are a little bit mixed,
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:50.480]   and it's controversial, but I like to eat like the French.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.320]   I like some soup, then I like my entree,
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.800]   and I like the salad at the end.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.620]   That turned out to have the steadiest and lowest rise
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.640]   in blood glucose for me, and then across time.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:02.040]   I also found that I love hot sauna.
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.040]   I go so hot with the sauna
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.280]   that I've been accused by Rogan and other people,
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.760]   I'm gonna turn myself into a brisket,
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.760]   but after the sauna, my blood sugar spikes,
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.760]   presumably because I'm a bit dehydrated,
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.320]   and it's the concentration of blood glucose.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.160]   Is that possible?
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:20.980]   Does that make sense?
[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:22.800]   - It does make sense, but also the heat
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.320]   can affect the accuracy of the sensor itself.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:27.040]   - Ah, okay, so that could be it too,
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:28.560]   but yeah, basically what it allowed me to do
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:30.560]   is make a few adjustments in terms of foods
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.840]   that I eliminated or eat less of,
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.800]   food ordering within a meal,
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:37.960]   and I find that I'm very susceptible to,
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.840]   if I don't include enough fat, dietary fat in the meal,
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.320]   then my blood glucose spikes,
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.520]   even if it's just like tuna, right?
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.680]   But by including olive oil and other things,
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:50.480]   it really blunts it, and of course here,
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:53.480]   we're doing correlative anecdata,
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.160]   but for me, I felt far better
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.580]   when I included a bit more fat,
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:01.720]   and when the food order was adjusted
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:03.160]   the way I mentioned before,
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.200]   always including a little bit of fiber really helped,
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.040]   and that makes sense, right?
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.080]   Slow the absorption of the food, presumably.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.080]   So I found that it was a very valuable experiment for me.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.720]   Again, this isn't an advertisement.
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.580]   It just so happens I did this and really benefit from it.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:21.600]   What are some other things that one can learn
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.320]   from continuous monitoring of blood glucose?
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.640]   What are some things to watch for
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:27.160]   that might signal a problem,
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:29.020]   and what are some fun things that one could do
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.560]   to explore and experiment?
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:31.880]   'Cause I like to explore and experiment.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.320]   Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of the things
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:35.860]   that you just naturally learned
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:39.000]   are the things that have been shown in data,
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.600]   and like you said, some of this data,
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:42.880]   it's like small studies, small groups of people,
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:46.200]   but for instance, adding fat and fiber to meals
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.960]   has a significant and repeatable impact in populations
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:52.160]   on lowering glucose response.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:56.600]   Fat, probably in some part due to slowing gastric emptying
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:58.720]   and actually slowing the digestion process,
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:01.020]   so the rise in the bloodstream is gonna slow down,
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:02.720]   and then fiber, both for that reason,
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.320]   but also because fiber can, in a sense,
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:08.280]   create a mesh sort of blocking the absorption
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:10.200]   of some of the glucose that's in the meal,
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:12.560]   so literally kind of actually preventing you
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:15.300]   from absorbing all of the carbs,
[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:18.060]   and we've actually seen that in the levels data set
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.440]   that the more fiber people include with their meals,
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:24.400]   we see essentially a direct relationship
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:26.760]   with lowering of their glucose excursions,
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:27.880]   which is really exciting,
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:30.480]   'cause fiber is something that you can add
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:32.000]   to meals very easily.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.360]   I put basil seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.360]   on a lot of my food at this point,
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:41.920]   'cause it's essentially a little bit of fat, a lot of fiber,
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.400]   and it kind of just helps you kind of get more
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.080]   from your meal.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:49.880]   So what you can learn, so I think step one,
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:52.160]   the way I think about a glucose monitor,
[02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:54.360]   first of all, I'll say the purpose of the glucose monitor
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:58.360]   is not to game the system and get flat glucose.
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:01.120]   The purpose of the glucose monitor is curiosity.
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:03.960]   It's to start to understand how,
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:09.400]   essentially an MRI for how all of our different dietary
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:11.920]   and lifestyle strategies are creating this readout
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:13.160]   of glucose in our body,
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:14.920]   which I think can be really interesting,
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:17.520]   and in a world where so many cards are stacked against us
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.880]   with diet and lifestyle,
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.120]   and where there's a lot of confusion
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.320]   about what's right for us,
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:24.200]   that can be very helpful in actually reducing
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.480]   the confusion and the cognitive load of our choices.
[02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:31.400]   We know that keeping your blood sugar
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:35.200]   through the course of a lifetime in a low and healthy range,
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.200]   so I don't mean up and down spikes during the day,
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:38.800]   but keeping your blood sugar healthy
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.200]   throughout the course of your lifetime
[02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:43.480]   is probably the best thing we can do for longevity,
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:47.520]   staying insulin sensitive, staying out of the diabetic range.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:50.200]   And so one thing that the glucose monitor does for us
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:54.040]   is just give us more awareness and agency
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:57.960]   into what the trends of our glucose are over time,
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:02.560]   as opposed to a literally one data point snapshot
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.200]   once a year in the doctor's office,
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:06.440]   which is what the majority of us are used to.
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:10.080]   I really love the idea
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:12.440]   that people who are able to wear glucose monitors
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.400]   every now and again, maybe once a year,
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.680]   or maybe more than once a year,
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:18.840]   they know what their glucose is.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:21.760]   And so they're never gonna walk into a doctor's office
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:24.240]   and have a bomb dropped on them
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.120]   about prediabetes or type 2 diabetes,
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:28.920]   'cause you have the data, which is ultimately,
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.360]   I hope, the world that we can move towards
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.840]   for a lot of biomarkers.
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.520]   So you can see trends over time,
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:35.080]   which I think is very valuable.
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.680]   One thing that's fascinating
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:39.520]   in terms of early prediction of metabolic disease
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:42.520]   is that you can see how long it takes your glucose
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.520]   to come down after a meal.
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:47.800]   So in a normal, healthy, insulin-sensitive body,
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:49.520]   even if the glucose goes way up,
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.400]   it should come way down very quickly,
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:53.600]   'cause the insulin is binded to insulin receptors
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.800]   and the glucose is getting taken up, and it'll lower.
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:58.280]   - What is quickly over the course of?
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:01.000]   - It should be down by two hours,
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.760]   but from what I've actually seen
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:04.720]   in our most insulin-sensitive people,
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:05.680]   and also in research
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:07.800]   that looks at young, healthy populations,
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:10.240]   you should basically be spiking and coming down,
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:13.280]   spike about 45 minutes and come down hour and a half,
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:15.160]   90 minutes to two hours.
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.080]   - This is after, sorry, after last bite?
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:18.960]   - After last bite,
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.800]   although it's hard to kind of exactly know.
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:22.120]   But yeah, meal is over.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.320]   I would say about 45 minutes to go up to the peak
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.400]   and then start coming down very quickly.
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:30.720]   Now, if you start to see that glucose is going up
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:35.080]   and then trailing very slowly back down to normal,
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:38.000]   maybe taking more than two hours, three hours,
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.280]   that is gonna be one of those early indicators
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:43.280]   of potential insulin resistance.
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:45.200]   Your body's not clearing the glucose,
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.040]   but that's not a metric that we use
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:49.760]   in standard practice at all.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:53.280]   And I've actually seen myself very insulin-sensitive.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.160]   My insulin is like 2.5.
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:58.760]   And if I don't sleep and I am stressed
[02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:00.200]   and I have been sitting,
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.600]   my glucose will take way longer to come down.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:05.080]   I have become transiently insulin-resistant.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.840]   So I think that's just fascinating to see that.
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:09.040]   So looking, what that ultimately,
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:12.080]   the metric that we call that is area under the curve.
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:14.560]   You want a low area under the curve,
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:16.520]   AUC, after a glucose spike.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.320]   So you wanna spike and come down quickly.
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.240]   That's gonna, if you shade the area under the curve,
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:22.360]   it's a small amount.
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.760]   If you go up and then trail off for two to three hours,
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:30.360]   that's gonna be a lot of shading under that curve.
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.920]   And high AUC is associated
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:34.320]   with insulin resistance, basically.
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:37.280]   Another thing that you can see
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:42.520]   is essentially glycemic variability.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:44.520]   And glycemic variability, GV,
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:47.680]   is a metric of how spiky your curves are.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.720]   Fassane paper out of Michael Schneider's lab
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:54.240]   at Stanford in 2018 called
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:58.760]   "Glucotypes Reveal New Patterns of Glucose Dysregulation."
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:00.600]   Totally landmark study,
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.240]   but basically they put continuous glucose monitors
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.120]   on non-diabetic individuals
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:08.960]   who by standard criteria of diabetes do not have diabetes.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:13.960]   And he showed that on a CGM, a continuous glucose monitor,
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:16.160]   you have these low variability people
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.660]   that are pretty much flat throughout the day
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:21.080]   with little teeny rolling hills after their meals.
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:22.520]   You have moderately spiky people,
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:24.040]   and then you have very spiky people
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.280]   who are going up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.260]   When you correlate those different patterns
[02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.440]   of glycemic variability in non-diabetic people,
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:33.720]   you find that the spikier they are,
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:35.640]   the worse their biomarkers are metabolically
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:38.640]   across the board, insulin, triglycerides, et cetera.
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:41.440]   So basically they're showing signs
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:44.660]   through variability of underlying dysfunction
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:47.160]   that you would never know from a standard test.
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:48.600]   Those are the people who I imagine
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:50.480]   are probably gonna go on to develop diseases.
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:52.360]   And yet, based on standard criteria,
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.640]   their doctor's telling them that they're fine,
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.840]   that they're all the same.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:57.760]   So he also showed in that study
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.440]   that non-diabetic individuals, when you have a CGM on,
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.440]   are going into the diabetic range
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.340]   and the pre-diabetic range a fairly significant amount.
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:08.640]   And we would never know that
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.840]   if you weren't actually tracking a movie of the glucose.
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:16.240]   So glycemic variability, area under the curve,
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:17.360]   those are two things.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:18.360]   Another really interesting thing
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:20.820]   you can know from a CGM is dawn effect.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:24.780]   So dawn effect is basically a term in the literature
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:27.800]   for how high your glucose rises
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:29.460]   right when you wake up in the morning.
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:32.000]   I don't know if you noticed this when you were wearing a CGM,
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.800]   but some people notice that the second they wake up,
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:39.080]   their glucose jumps up five, 10, 20, 30 points.
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.120]   What's happening here
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.360]   is that the cortisol awakening response
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.760]   to actually get you to wake up and get out of bed,
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:47.720]   that cortisol can cause you
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:49.680]   to dump a bunch of glucose from your liver
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:52.680]   'cause it's basically saying stress hormone, cortisol,
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:54.840]   we gotta get up, we need glucose to fuel the muscles,
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:56.240]   let's dump a little glucose.
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:00.680]   So it's normal, but what the research shows
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:02.960]   is that magnitude of dawn effect
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:06.320]   is correlated with insulin resistance.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.680]   So the more the dawn effect you're getting,
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:11.280]   I think it can signal maybe the more stress you're under,
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.260]   the more cortisol you have floating around,
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:15.520]   how big your cortisol awakening response is.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.480]   But also if you imagine
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:18.320]   if you're dumping all that glucose from your liver
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.140]   and your cells aren't taking it up well
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:21.880]   because you're insulin resistant,
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:24.800]   that response, that dawn effect is gonna be higher.
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.200]   So I don't have the numbers right in front of me,
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.560]   but typically I would wanna see a dawn effect,
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:33.400]   I think of like less than 10 points.
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.520]   So you wake up and you may very well see a rise,
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:38.720]   this is absence of any food yet,
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:43.040]   and you do not wanna see that going up 20, 30, 40 points.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:44.360]   Some people see a little bump again
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:46.840]   with caffeine in the morning because it's more cortisol.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.480]   And so that's another thing
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:52.400]   that standard stuff would never tell you.
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.840]   So those are kind of some of the looking
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:57.080]   at early predictors of metabolic dysfunction.
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.080]   More of the fun stuff is like actually just figuring out
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:01.680]   how is food affecting your body?
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.200]   And this is where people really enjoy it
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:05.120]   and figure out like, oh my God,
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:06.880]   this food that I thought was healthy
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:09.880]   is actually not serving me.
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.400]   And actually a lot of people I think
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.560]   were trying to make healthy choices.
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.960]   My boyfriend, when we started dating,
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:17.440]   he started using levels.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:21.200]   His healthy snack, he worked in Venice,
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.240]   would be to go to Moon Juice and get,
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:24.720]   oh gosh, I don't wanna throw Moon Juice
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:26.040]   under the bus here, but he would get like--
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:26.880]   They have some tasty stuff there.
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.800]   They do, but he would get this green juice
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:31.480]   that was sweetened with dates and it was like $9
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:33.400]   and this was like the healthy choice.
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.320]   And he saw the second he put on levels
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.640]   that it was causing a huge spike,
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:41.200]   like 50, 60, 70 points, and then he was crashing.
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.880]   And he was actually trying to make a good decision.
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:49.640]   So now he's swapped his snacks out for more like,
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:52.200]   grass-fed cheese and some flax crackers
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.480]   and maybe like a venison stick or something,
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:56.600]   like grab-and-go stuff that isn't spiking his glucose.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.800]   But I think it can help people figure out
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:01.480]   which foods are doing what I want them to do
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:04.000]   and which maybe aren't.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000]   And same thing happened for so many of our members
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.640]   with oatmeal, unfortunately oatmeal,
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.400]   instant oatmeal is one of the biggest spikers
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:13.360]   in our data set for breakfast.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.880]   And a lot of people are making that choice
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:16.480]   'cause they think it's heart healthy.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:19.400]   And in many people, it's actually causing
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.240]   a big glucose excursion and crash.
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:24.440]   And then in some other people, it's not.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:26.800]   And so it's really helping with,
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:28.080]   what are the sneaky spikers?
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.120]   And then where's the biochemical individuality?
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.600]   And there was a phenomenal paper
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:38.600]   out of Israel from Cell about seven years ago
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:41.880]   called Personalized Nutrition
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.840]   by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.640]   It made big waves, but it basically showed
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:49.880]   that you and I could eat the same handful of blueberries
[02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:54.880]   and have totally different glycemic responses.
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:57.400]   So the idea of glycemic index
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:59.240]   as like a certain amount of food
[02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:00.240]   with a certain amount of glucose
[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:01.760]   causes a certain glucose rise,
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.560]   it kind of debunked that.
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.120]   And that matters because repeated,
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:09.160]   sustained glycemic variability over time
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:10.600]   is not good for our health.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:12.920]   We wanna choose the foods or balance the foods
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.880]   that are gonna keep us relatively more stable.
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:18.400]   So that's very helpful,
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:20.560]   just understanding your personal response to food.
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:22.360]   And then what are the lifestyle strategies
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:23.480]   that you can use?
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:25.840]   Sleeping better, walking after meals,
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:28.840]   more resistance training, cold plunging,
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:31.920]   breath work that can actually serve
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:34.920]   to modulate the food environment
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:36.960]   to actually reduce the glucose spikes.
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:38.600]   And people find that all of those things
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:40.280]   can positively impact glucose spikes,
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:41.640]   especially the walks after the meals.
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:45.480]   But it's been fascinating to see a lot of women,
[02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:47.920]   especially like menopausal women in our community
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:51.080]   who find that their glucose patterns are getting worse
[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.520]   because estrogen's dropping,
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:56.560]   and that's gonna really take a hit on insulin sensitivity.
[02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:58.600]   They start resistance training,
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:00.800]   glucose comes kind of right back down.
[02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:02.600]   So because of the monitor,
[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:05.520]   they can feel more confident in the intervention
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:07.880]   they've chose to do to help with metabolism,
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:10.440]   and that kind of creates a virtuous cycle.
[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:13.880]   So those are some of the big things.
[02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:15.280]   - Those are big.
[02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:16.120]   - Can I mention one more?
[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.880]   - Please. - I know, I love that.
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:19.360]   I could obviously talk about this all day.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.440]   - Wonderful. - I think it's fascinating,
[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:22.400]   but this is just one more that I think is fascinating
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:26.400]   'cause this was a paper in "Nature" from last year
[02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:29.000]   that talked about, and this may actually be
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.880]   one of the most valuable things to people,
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:33.960]   which is that, again, talking about cravings,
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:36.800]   we all wanna get off the craving grip.
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:39.800]   This paper in "Nature" showed that essentially
[02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:41.240]   when people spike their glucose
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:43.200]   with high-carb, high-starchy foods,
[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:45.720]   they'll often have a big crash afterwards.
[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:47.400]   And the reason for that is because a big spike
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:48.960]   leads to a lot of insulin secretion,
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.260]   and then you soak up all the glucose,
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:53.180]   and sometimes you can actually go below your baseline.
[02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:56.160]   So a small spike usually won't lead to a crash,
[02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:58.040]   but a big spike often will.
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:00.080]   That's called reactive hypoglycemia,
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:03.320]   postprandial hypoglycemia.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.040]   A lot of people think they're dealing with hypoglycemia
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:08.460]   when in fact what they're really dealing with
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:10.400]   is that they're spiking their glucose too high,
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:12.240]   and then they're crashing. - I see.
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:17.240]   - And the paper showed that the extent of post-meal dips,
[02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:20.480]   the crash after the spike, was predictive
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:24.400]   of 24-hour energy intake and cravings for carbohydrates.
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:25.520]   And this makes sense.
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:29.100]   If you crash low, that is a signal to your body.
[02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:32.320]   We have to get our glucose back up,
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:36.320]   and it will drive you to eat high-energy foods,
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:38.000]   carbohydrate-rich foods, and cravings.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.640]   So one of the best things we can do,
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:41.680]   I believe from my personal experience,
[02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:42.600]   from members' experience,
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:44.340]   and with some data to support this,
[02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:47.200]   is that one of the adjuncts we can use
[02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:50.240]   to manage our cravings is actually
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:54.320]   to lower the extent of our spikes so that we crash less.
[02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:57.760]   And so that was a fasting study looking at CGM data.
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.600]   - That's interesting.
[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:01.900]   So the CGMs can reveal things,
[02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:03.960]   not just in the immediate meal period,
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:07.880]   but can relate to sort of downstream consequences.
[02:33:07.880 --> 02:33:10.420]   Yeah, again, I found it to be tremendously useful.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.440]   I'm so glad you mentioned sleep, by the way.
[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:13.680]   I'm gonna resist the temptation
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.920]   to rattle off 20 studies showing that.
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:17.160]   - Oh, God.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:20.440]   - You know, even having too much bright light in a room
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:22.520]   while one is sleeping at night, even dim light,
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:23.960]   which is, you know, I don't wanna scare people
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:25.760]   into thinking they have to sleep in complete darkness,
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:28.680]   but although an eye mask can be great,
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:31.520]   can alter morning blood glucose levels
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:34.200]   in, I believe it was adults and kids as well.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:35.200]   It's a study in proceedings
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:37.520]   in the National Academy of Sciences.
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:39.600]   I have to go back and check if it included kids,
[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.240]   but pretty striking.
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:44.160]   And then it's, there's something very clear
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.720]   about the fact that when people get
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:47.800]   the early night sleep of four to five hours,
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:52.320]   but then don't get the REM-dominating, you know,
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.240]   last hour or two of sleep in the morning
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:56.520]   that resting blood glucose is altered.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:58.400]   It's so interesting to think about what's going on in sleep.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.180]   There's at least one paper that I'm aware of
[02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:02.200]   where they had people breathing into a tube during sleep
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:05.640]   to measure what sorts of metabolism they were undergoing.
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:08.160]   And it's interesting, during a full night's sleep,
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:10.720]   all of us seem to transition
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:14.280]   between different forms of metabolism.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.120]   I'll send you this paper.
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:15.960]   It's really cool.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:17.680]   And I'll put a link to it in the show note caption
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:19.400]   such that at one portion of the night,
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:22.280]   we're metabolic, we're relying more on,
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:24.440]   let's just call it sugars for sake of simplicity.
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:26.080]   Other times we're more ketone dominant.
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:29.280]   There's a market shifts in metabolism throughout the night.
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:30.960]   It's almost like the brain and body cycle
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.240]   through all the different modes
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:34.680]   of metabolism throughout the night.
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.240]   And then almost like a rehearsal of the metabolic pathways.
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:40.600]   If, you know, we can anthropomorphize a bit here,
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:43.300]   but then if sleep is truncated,
[02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:47.900]   it clearly has an effect on daytime fuel regulation.
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:48.740]   Just so interesting.
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.880]   So getting sufficient sleep,
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:53.440]   getting quality sleep is absolutely key.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:54.800]   There's a lot for people to pay attention to,
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:56.720]   but you've given us a lot of tractable avenues
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.440]   for people to do that, that are mostly behavioral.
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:02.000]   There's a few don'ts, but mostly some do's.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.400]   We haven't mentioned that, you know,
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.620]   you don't need to even perhaps belong to a gym.
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:07.880]   It's like, and with the cold exposure thing,
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:08.760]   I always say, you know, if anything,
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:10.200]   it'll save you money on the heating bill.
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:14.380]   So there's a literally potential negative cost there.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:19.240]   - I think levels and other CGMs are really interesting
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:21.960]   and valuable to experiment with.
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:25.240]   What sorts of other stuff is going to soon be monitored
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:26.060]   in our blood?
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:27.680]   'Cause for instance, I would love to know
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:30.640]   continuous hormone levels, lipid levels,
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:31.800]   blood sugar levels.
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:35.680]   I mean, are we moving past just blood glucose
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.440]   and are there soon to be other things in these monitors
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.560]   so that when we, and by the way, if you haven't used these,
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:43.400]   it's really cool.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.540]   You just take your phone, you scan it over the sensor,
[02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:47.440]   and then it basically gives you a chart graph
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.680]   of what's going on in your bloodstream.
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.520]   - And now they're all, the latest gen of each of them
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:53.560]   are all Bluetooth now.
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:55.640]   So no more scanning, which is kind of nice.
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.360]   And the answer is yes.
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:00.260]   There are several different analytes
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:01.400]   that we're going to be able to track.
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:05.880]   And Abbott, which is one of the three main manufacturers
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:09.080]   of CGMs has announced that they have a new product
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:11.400]   called the Lingo, which is going to actually be able
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:16.400]   to measure ketones, lactate, and alcohol continuously,
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:18.660]   which is pretty interesting from like a metabolic,
[02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:20.180]   comprehensive metabolic standpoint.
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:23.940]   Different sensors for each, not all in one.
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:26.380]   So I think we'll have to like polka dot ourselves
[02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:28.420]   if we're tracking all those things.
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:33.340]   And then Dexcom, which is the other main company
[02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:35.620]   that makes CGMs has just announced
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:37.100]   they're coming out with an over-the-counter
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:39.620]   non-prescription version of a CGM
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:41.200]   called the Stella later this year.
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.820]   So there's exciting things happening in the industry,
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:47.420]   and I really do think continuous monitoring,
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:50.580]   it's going to expand to a lot of these other things
[02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:52.680]   that you're talking about, hormones, et cetera.
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:54.620]   And I mean, it really needs to.
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:58.680]   I think that snapshots of dynamic system
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:00.720]   are just never going to really be able to give us
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:02.460]   a full picture on what's going on.
[02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:05.920]   And what we really want to be able to do
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:08.020]   to dig our way out of this healthcare crisis,
[02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:10.840]   I think is empowerment individually
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:13.760]   and understanding how this rapidly changing environment
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:15.260]   is affecting our own biology.
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:17.200]   So we can make the targeted choices
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.720]   to hopefully change the environment
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:21.440]   to be more conducive to cellular health.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.940]   And continuous monitoring is a closed loop biofeedback
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:28.080]   that can help us with that decision-making
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:30.980]   and essentially predict failure of the system
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:33.260]   rather than wait for failure of the system
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:34.840]   before we do something about it.
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:37.280]   So yeah, I think a lot's coming down the pipeline.
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.120]   - Love it. - Yeah.
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:42.060]   - Let's talk a little bit about mindset.
[02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:43.620]   This is a really interesting topic
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.940]   that you include in your book.
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:47.020]   We've had guests come on and talk about growth mindset.
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:48.440]   Stress can be enhancing mindset.
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:51.940]   I'm big on mindset because I'm interested
[02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:55.180]   in how our cognitive reframing or cognitive framing
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:57.240]   can just change the way our biology works
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:58.720]   and vice versa, of course.
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:01.820]   But you talk about mindset in a certain context.
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:05.260]   And one of the favorite passages around that
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:07.360]   that I really enjoyed was the relationship
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:10.680]   between kind of like trying to control everything
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:15.680]   and nature and how getting into nature itself
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:18.200]   can be valuable for us.
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.640]   So maybe touch a little bit on mindset, if you will.
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:23.200]   And what are your thoughts on nature,
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.000]   literally getting out of doors?
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:25.840]   - Yeah.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:31.800]   So I think that mindset and more broadly than mindset,
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:35.920]   I think psychology and our relationship specifically
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.220]   with fear and control,
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:42.140]   I think they're probably the most under-recognized thing
[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:44.680]   that is impacting the metabolic health crisis,
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:46.160]   the chronic disease epidemic.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:47.800]   There has been data that's looked into this.
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:49.200]   We know that there's studies showing
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:52.040]   that loneliness impacts mitochondrial function
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:53.680]   and that loneliness is a risk factor
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:55.440]   and stress is a risk factor in these things.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.080]   And something really fascinating actually with the CGM data
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.360]   is that many people who wear a CGM,
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:02.400]   I don't know if you saw this,
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.920]   but when you feel stressed,
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.160]   it actually has a diabetogenic effect.
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:09.480]   It literally causes our blood sugar to go up
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:11.760]   when we feel stress.
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:16.440]   And that can be a fascinating unlock for people to realize,
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:18.360]   I kind of feel like I'm okay right now,
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:21.680]   but my body is telling me something different.
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:24.360]   It's telling me that biochemically,
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:27.320]   I'm actually releasing energy stores from my liver,
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.760]   glucose, to fight some threat
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.600]   that I wasn't really aware of.
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:34.320]   So we definitely understand there's this link here,
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:37.440]   but it's certainly not made its way into clinical practice.
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:39.080]   So the way I think about it
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:41.000]   is that what we know about the cells
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.360]   and especially the mitochondria
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:43.800]   is that the mitochondria
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:45.920]   are more than the powerhouses of the cell.
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.360]   They actually are a part of the cell
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.560]   that is constantly tracking resources and threats
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:56.800]   and are basically modulating energy resources based on that.
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.480]   And the threats can be anything.
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:00.360]   They can be a virus, they can be,
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:01.800]   and this is all coordinated through this thing
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:03.560]   called the cell danger response.
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:06.400]   It can be a virus, it can be a toxin in the environment,
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:08.040]   it can be lack of micronutrients
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:09.400]   for the electron transport chain
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.560]   that it needs to do its function.
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:14.200]   It can also be psychological threats
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:16.760]   because of course our psychological milieu
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:21.560]   translates through nerves and hormones and neurotransmitters
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:24.160]   and our microbiome to affect our cellular biology
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:25.000]   throughout our whole body.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.800]   Our cells hear every single thought
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:29.840]   that we're thinking through biochemistry.
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:33.880]   And when a cell and a mitochondria
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:36.240]   are getting the message
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:38.800]   that there is a threat or something to be afraid of,
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.600]   they are going to change metabolic function
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:44.960]   towards defense alarm, threat response,
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:49.120]   and away from repair, homeostasis,
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:52.000]   building, essentially thriving.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.680]   So, and I think what's really
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.240]   maybe the most unnatural thing about our modern world,
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:01.440]   you know, the food of course is unnatural,
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:02.960]   70% is ultra-processed,
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.960]   but we also have this device in our hands
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:11.480]   literally with us all the time,
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.480]   streaming fear-inducing media into our brains and eyeballs
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:19.480]   every waking moment of the day, if we let it.
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:22.280]   So we're glued to our screens and our devices,
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:25.840]   and right now, essentially the traumas and fears
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:28.920]   of 8 billion people all over an entire globe
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.880]   are now ours to process.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:33.760]   And our cells and our mitochondria,
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.040]   there is no escaping it.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:37.720]   They are going to respond to that.
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:39.840]   And so I think a big part
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:41.800]   of the metabolic health conversation is,
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:47.760]   how do we create a sense of safety in our bodies
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:50.400]   no matter what is happening outside of our bodies?
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.640]   And this can come down to,
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:55.840]   every person's journey will be different for this,
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:59.120]   'cause the things that cause a sense of threat or fear
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:01.200]   for any two people are gonna be different.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:04.120]   And I think some of the main categories is,
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:07.300]   one, unresolved childhood trauma,
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:08.440]   like something that I think
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:10.680]   is getting a lot more talked about these days,
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:12.800]   but like what's embedded in our nervous system,
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:15.560]   these limiting beliefs and memories that are really wired
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.320]   that create a sense of hypervigilance in us
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.560]   sort of all the time.
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:20.200]   What's coming in through our devices,
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:21.560]   our phones, our computers,
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:23.400]   the media that we're exposed to,
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.820]   that's constantly giving a fear signal.
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:27.820]   And I think on a broader level,
[02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:30.480]   a big Western one that we don't talk about
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.880]   is literally like existential fear of mortality.
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:36.040]   We have a very de-spiritualized,
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.160]   very uniquely death-fearing culture.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:43.080]   Like you look at other cultures, Eastern, indigenous,
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:46.600]   the Stoics, they all had intense curiosity about death.
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:48.060]   We talk about the cycles of life.
[02:42:48.060 --> 02:42:51.400]   There's this real engagement with it
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.480]   that we are so afraid of in the Western system
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:57.760]   to the extent that our entire healthcare system,
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:01.200]   actually, I think, we've built it around,
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.080]   like we're not gonna help you thrive.
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:06.360]   We're just gonna do whatever we can
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:07.680]   to make sure you don't die.
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.120]   Like it's built in everywhere.
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:12.440]   And so we've got the devices,
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:14.040]   we've got the childhood trauma,
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:16.080]   we've got the fear of mortality.
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.900]   We have a very poor system of mental healthcare
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:22.100]   in the culture.
[02:43:22.100 --> 02:43:25.500]   And I think that through all these things,
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:29.480]   Americans are getting crushed mindset and psychology-wise.
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.060]   And that is a big, big trigger of our mitochondria,
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:34.540]   essentially diverting resources
[02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:36.540]   towards defense threat and alarm
[02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:39.540]   rather than homeostasis building repair.
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:44.540]   So again, it comes back to taking really honest stock
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:49.100]   of what are the true fear triggers in our lives
[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:51.020]   across those and others
[02:43:51.020 --> 02:43:56.360]   and creating a sense of safety in our minds and bodies,
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:58.540]   no matter what the external world looks like,
[02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.420]   which may mean putting boundaries up to the media,
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:04.660]   doing the therapy, doing the different modalities.
[02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:06.580]   What I believe, and I talk about in the book,
[02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:08.960]   getting back to the question about nature,
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:11.540]   is one of the best things that we can do
[02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:14.860]   is actually literally just go outside.
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:17.820]   And it sounds so simple,
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:21.660]   but one of the most astonishing stats
[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:24.340]   I literally found in researching this entire book
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:25.780]   was that the average American is spending
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:28.580]   93.7% of their time indoors.
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:29.420]   - Wild.
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:34.420]   - 93.7, that's in a car or in a building.
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:38.620]   So we are locked in these cages,
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:41.100]   staring at fear-inducing media,
[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:44.400]   and our mitochondria are like, what?
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:46.980]   Like, I don't know where to channel my energy.
[02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:49.220]   It's just, it's short-circuiting, I think.
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:51.540]   So many things happen when we go outside, as you know.
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:53.520]   I mean, even what the vision system
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:55.680]   is doing to our anxiety levels.
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:57.900]   We are getting sunlight, which of course,
[02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:02.360]   for complex reasons is very helpful
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:04.060]   for our metabolic health separately,
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:06.320]   entrains our chronobiology,
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:11.320]   and light from the sun is an incredible regulator
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:13.680]   of our mitochondrial function.
[02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:18.140]   But it also, it's our best teacher.
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:19.580]   You know, when we're out in nature
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:21.940]   and we really look at how beautiful the world is
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:23.160]   and the cycles of nature,
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:26.580]   we see the cycles of, you know, the seasons,
[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:30.040]   and we see the awe of the sun and the trees,
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:33.080]   and just all this alchemy that's happening outside of us.
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.580]   We see, you know, spring to summer to fall to winter.
[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:38.780]   We see the tides moving in and out.
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:40.500]   Everything's in phases.
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:44.160]   And I think when we reflect and meditate
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.480]   on all the cycles and the polarities in nature,
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:51.760]   night and day, cold and hot,
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:55.500]   new moon, you know, quarter moon, full moon,
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:57.600]   you know, all these things,
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:01.200]   it's actually, it entrenches on a subconscious
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:05.880]   and conscious level that there is a fundamental harmony
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:08.120]   and pattern to the world we're living in
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:09.320]   that is bigger than us,
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:12.740]   and that is fundamentally good and beautiful.
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:16.500]   And we are locked inside of the four walls of our house.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:18.460]   I think we get very scared.
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:20.260]   We get very controllable.
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:21.860]   And the system wants it that way,
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:23.020]   because when we are scared
[02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:24.900]   and when we are existentially afraid,
[02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:27.300]   we will literally do anything.
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:30.460]   We will buy anything, do anything, watch anything
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:33.700]   that will in some way ameliorate that pain
[02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:35.420]   that we're feeling.
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:38.800]   And we will take any pill, we'll get any surgery,
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:41.760]   anything that makes us feel like we're controlling
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:44.440]   this seemingly out of control situation.
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:47.080]   And that's what drives us into all the dopamine loops,
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:50.000]   you know, the social media, the processed food,
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.520]   the porn, the gambling, the alcohol, all of it.
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:56.880]   It's all to ameliorate, I think, ultimately fear.
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:59.400]   And I think, yeah, I think by actually really
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:01.000]   just spending a lot more time,
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.040]   try and get that 93.7% down to like 50%,
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.760]   spend as much time as you can outside.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:07.920]   We know that people who spend more time outside
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:08.880]   are metabolically healthier.
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:11.200]   And I think it's from pleotropic reasons.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.040]   But I think one of it is that it is the ultimate
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:20.880]   convincing of abundance and fundamental abundance
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:24.040]   in our world and of awe,
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:27.640]   which I think is really the antidote to fear.
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.480]   And that has a profoundly soothing effect
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:35.680]   on our psychology and the sense of scarcity
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:37.520]   that drives a lot of the decisions
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:40.280]   that actually make us unhealthy.
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.280]   It's fundamentally rooted in scarcity.
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:47.720]   And I think also when we realize we are part of nature,
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:49.480]   again, going back to that Taoist statement,
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:51.940]   we're a process, not an entity.
[02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:55.680]   Realizing like, you know, all the trees around us
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:57.320]   when we take that walk, even in a city,
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:47:58.880]   we see all the trees, all those plants,
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:00.640]   all those leaves are making the oxygen
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:02.240]   that process, that literally let us
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:03.680]   do oxy-phosphorylation.
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:06.920]   And that sun and that leaf on the tree,
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:09.680]   the sun's energy is literally being stored
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:11.780]   in the carbon-carbon bonds that the plants
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:13.680]   are generating in photosynthesis,
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:16.400]   that ultimately all metabolism is,
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:19.360]   is unlocking the potential energy stored from the sun
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:21.520]   to create the human energy that lets us love
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:22.920]   and move and live and think
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:25.020]   and do all the things we love to do.
[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:27.720]   And then it just becomes so obvious.
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:30.960]   Like, of course we have to like eat real food.
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:32.720]   And of course we have to not poison our soil
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:33.560]   with pesticides.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:35.880]   And of course we have to like, you know,
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:38.120]   care about the environment and we have to get outside
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:39.840]   and move and we have to be in the sunlight during the day
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:41.960]   because we are the environment.
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:44.080]   We are a process that's constantly
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:47.120]   in dynamic conversation with it.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.120]   And I think, I think a lot of people will find
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:53.960]   that their health gets a lot better
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:56.120]   if they spend radically more time outdoors.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.120]   And I think a lot of people might say,
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:48:59.680]   well, I can't, I work on a computer.
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:02.080]   And I'm like, you know, Rome is burning.
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:04.080]   Like we're sick as hell right now.
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:05.200]   We need to get creative.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:07.920]   Like move your computer outside,
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.360]   take a walking meeting, open your mail outdoors,
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.660]   chop your vegetables on your balcony at your apartment.
[02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:18.360]   Like we have to find a way to connect back with our source,
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:21.580]   understand that the world is abundant and harmonious,
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:25.920]   re-entrench the belief in our connection with nature.
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:28.920]   And then let all of our dietary and lifestyle strategies
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:31.480]   stem from that sense of gratitude and awe.
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:33.080]   And that will lead us right where we need to go,
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:38.120]   which is a really, I think, joyful experience
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:41.680]   of our health journey that's rooted fundamentally
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:45.020]   in connection rather than us being siloed
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:47.360]   from all of this, which going back
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:48.560]   to the beginning of the conversation,
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:49.520]   that's fundamentally what's wrong
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:50.520]   with the healthcare system.
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:52.920]   It's silos and we have siloed ourself
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:55.720]   from all of the life-giving things in our environment.
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:58.440]   And that has ultimately led us to be very, very, very sick.
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.040]   And we've just, I think we got to go back outside.
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:02.000]   So that's one of the things,
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.800]   but there's many other things we can do
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.820]   to change those, our relationship with fear.
[02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:11.820]   But we can't change the world as a whole,
[02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:15.840]   but we can change what happens inside our body
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:17.400]   in terms of how we respond to it.
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:19.960]   And for our mitochondria's sake, we have to.
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:23.920]   We have to create a sense of safety in our bodies
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:25.880]   for our mitochondria to do the work we need them
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:27.200]   to do for health.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.240]   - I love it.
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:30.920]   And I love it for many reasons.
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:35.360]   I think it was my, I know it was my friend
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:37.480]   and former guest on this podcast, Rick Rubin,
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:39.840]   who several times early in our friendship,
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.840]   he said, "Back to nature, the only truth."
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:47.120]   And I asked him what he meant by that.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:50.200]   And, you know, 'cause Rick can be a little bit,
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:53.360]   I'm cryptic sometimes, not always, but sometimes.
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:55.360]   And what he was saying is, you know, it's a real thing.
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:58.200]   You know, you can immediately feel the connectedness
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:02.920]   between the human experience and life of other types,
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:06.360]   plants, animals, you know, sunlight, the circadian rhythms
[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:09.900]   and the rhythms of light and dark,
[02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:11.800]   because they impact us so powerfully.
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:16.800]   I mean, if there were ever a force in the world
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:19.520]   that impacts how we feel, it's the circadian rhythm.
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:21.060]   It's the rising and setting of the sun.
[02:51:21.060 --> 02:51:22.960]   It's the impact of light and dark.
[02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:25.900]   And then all the other things that you talked about today,
[02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:28.120]   I can't help but reflect on kind of your take
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:30.960]   on kind of what a lot of, not all,
[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:34.760]   but a lot of modern society attempts to do.
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:36.780]   It attempts to do a lot of good things too, I believe.
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.980]   I'm a believer in technology,
[02:51:38.980 --> 02:51:41.260]   but that it, if I were to translate,
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:44.840]   it sounded like what you were saying is that
[02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:48.920]   it gives us a sense of loss of control by instilling fear,
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.000]   like we don't have control.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.780]   And then there are a number of,
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:55.320]   let's just call them programs in the world
[02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:58.840]   that then sell back the illusion of some sense of agency,
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:00.200]   little by little, right?
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:02.480]   Temporary agency, and then puts you back into the cycle.
[02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:04.160]   And there's something about going into nature,
[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:07.280]   which just removes one from all of that,
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:08.500]   at least temporarily,
[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:10.320]   gives you a more basic understanding
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:12.820]   of the relationship to self and things around us.
[02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:16.240]   Even just looking, being able to see it to a distance,
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:19.440]   we know is powerful for the brain, reducing anxiety.
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:21.480]   We know being outdoors for two hours or more per day
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:23.340]   reduces myopia and nearsightedness.
[02:52:23.340 --> 02:52:25.400]   This is independent of all the other effects
[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:28.800]   of circadian rhythms, et cetera.
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:29.840]   Anyway, and on and on.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:34.160]   So I second and third and hear here
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:37.640]   all the statements you made before.
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:38.680]   I also just have to say,
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:41.840]   I really appreciate how you are able to
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:46.440]   tackle the cellar biology, the molecular biology,
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:49.120]   the macroscopic things that we can all do,
[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:52.920]   walking, resistance training, cold exposure, sleep,
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:56.260]   high-intensity interval training,
[02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:58.440]   and make a case for each and all of those
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:01.120]   as it relates to the underlying biochemistry.
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:04.000]   And weave all that together in a way that then
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.720]   you beautifully wrapped into this idea
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:06.920]   of connecting to nature
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.860]   and not divorcing ourselves from modern life,
[02:53:08.860 --> 02:53:09.800]   but really looking at the ways
[02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:11.400]   in which certain components of modern life
[02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:12.760]   are really making us sick.
[02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:16.120]   Not just the behaviors, not just the do's and the don'ts
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:18.000]   that it's kind of imparting on us,
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.980]   but also kind of the psychology around it.
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:25.040]   It's that it is quietly, but powerfully oppressive
[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:26.720]   is the message that I'm getting.
[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:28.360]   And that we have to take a stand against it.
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:29.680]   And the way to take a stand against it
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:32.400]   is to do what are very basic
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:34.240]   and fairly easy to access things,
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:36.800]   making better choices about food, timing,
[02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:40.000]   quality, amount, exercise, and on and on.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:43.120]   So I'm running long in my response
[02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:46.880]   to your much more eloquent description of mindset.
[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:49.840]   But what I wanna say is on behalf of myself
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:52.040]   and everyone listening, I so appreciate,
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:54.080]   we appreciate the work that you're doing
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:57.140]   to be a medical doctor specialized in one of these silos,
[02:53:57.140 --> 02:54:00.600]   and then to take a step out and say, nope, not me.
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:03.840]   I'm gonna do what I see as best for the greater good
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:05.100]   in terms of giving people tools,
[02:54:05.100 --> 02:54:07.160]   giving people a sense of agency and autonomy
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:08.680]   to take control of their health.
[02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:11.520]   This is in some ways a heretical idea,
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:16.520]   but luckily the numbers of folks like you are growing
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.000]   and you're a real leader in this field by example
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:21.400]   and by the incredible work you're doing
[02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:24.040]   with technology and information sharing.
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:25.720]   Love, love, love the book.
[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:28.360]   I did go through it front to back.
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:29.760]   I haven't tried the recipes yet,
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:31.100]   but thank you for bringing the blueberries.
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:33.880]   I'll try the recipes, at least one of them.
[02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:36.780]   And I just wanna thank you for sharing what you do
[02:54:36.780 --> 02:54:39.720]   and for continuing to do what you do.
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:42.360]   We need it and we appreciate it.
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:44.080]   So thank you. - Thank you.

[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:29.040]   So that's Instagram, Facebook, X, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:30.480]   And on all those platforms,
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:32.640]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:34.200]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:35.560]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:37.280]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:38.580]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:41.840]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.

[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.120]   from learning in neuroplasticity
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:55:58.640]   or how to improve your sleep, optimizing dopamine,
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:01.040]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:02.760]   There's a foundational fitness protocol,
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.580]   all available, completely zero cost.

[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:22.120]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:24.700]   (upbeat music)
