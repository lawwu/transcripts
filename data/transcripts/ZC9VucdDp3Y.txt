[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.480]   Our next speaker is gonna be Adam Grossman.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.120]   If you don't know who Adam Grossman is,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   you may not be following along very well
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.640]   on the website started not that long ago
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.480]   by Jonathan Clements, Humble Dollar.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.360]   But he is a regular on that website.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.900]   He's also the founder of Mayport,
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.320]   a flat fee wealth management firm.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960]   And he's gonna be talking to us today
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   about an important concept that he calls the center lane.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.260]   Now we'll be doing the same thing with questions.
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.140]   He's gonna try to save a few minutes for us
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.360]   at the end to ask questions,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520]   but if not, catch him afterward
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.920]   and ask your question directly to him.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   All right, he'll go out in the hallway
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.440]   and you can step out there and ask question afterward
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.680]   if you don't get it answered.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.640]   But let's give it up for Adam Grossman.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.680]   - Great, thank you, Jim, for that kind introduction.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   And thank you all for being here.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.280]   I feel like I'm among family,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.320]   except that one difference is that I don't disagree
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720]   with anything that anybody else has said.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.240]   So I think there will be some overlap
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.440]   in a lot of the topics
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.840]   that Christine and Jonathan talked about,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   but maybe a little bit of a different perspective.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040]   So the title of the session is the center lane.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.640]   When I first started in the industry on the first day,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.920]   the boss of the firm sat me down
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.100]   and he talked to me about how the firm worked
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.940]   with the clients.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.620]   And what I was expecting was formulas,
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.400]   investment frameworks, growth versus value,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.500]   irrevocable trust, nuts and bolts, things like that.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.060]   But instead, the first thing that he talked about
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.160]   was the recency bias.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.200]   And I was kind of floored.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.840]   I thought, I've spent all this time in school,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.800]   all these textbooks,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   and the first thing that he wants to teach me
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   as a new person is about recency bias, behavioral concept.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.280]   And that's when a light bulb went on for me.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   I think probably everyone in this room appreciates
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.200]   that there are two answers to every financial question.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.360]   There's what the calculator says,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.720]   and then there's how you feel about it.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.880]   But threading the needle is not always so easy.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.000]   And in a lot of cases,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.040]   what we're dealing with are situations
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.960]   where we have some data, but not complete data.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   And so how do you make a decision in situations like that?
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   And so to get started,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.040]   what I'd like to talk about is a mistake
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.180]   that I once made.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.120]   So one year I was on vacation with my family,
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.440]   and this is the scene of the crime here.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.800]   So we're in Florida, as you can see,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.760]   and we're heading down the highway.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.520]   We're looking for a place for lunch.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.400]   And I knew which exit it was, and I saw it coming up,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.020]   so I got in the right lane to get off.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.720]   But as you can see there,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.040]   the kind of the yellow part, if you can make it out,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.180]   the exit was on the left.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.600]   So needless to say, I missed the exit.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   Needless to say, faced recriminations from my family
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   for spending, I don't know how much more time
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.860]   than the sort of sweltering heat and the traffic in Miami.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.040]   But as I was sitting there hearing those recriminations,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.880]   I started thinking about,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.680]   well, if I had been in the center lane,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.720]   then that actually would have been the better approach,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.540]   because I would have hedged my bets,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.100]   and whether the exit had been on the left,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.620]   which is unusual, but it does happen,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.040]   or it had been on the right like usual,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.960]   then I wouldn't have missed my exit.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.120]   And so that's when I started thinking first
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.640]   about this idea of the center lane, of hedging your bets.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.240]   But if you think about it,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   that doesn't really seem like a rigorous way
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.100]   to make financial decisions, right?
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.160]   I mean, oh, let me hedge my bets, split the difference.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.360]   That doesn't seem optimal, right?
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.580]   That doesn't seem like the right way to approach things.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.880]   But as I thought more about it over the years,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.840]   it occurred to me that maybe there is a way
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.280]   to use this in a helpful way.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.840]   So, you know, what is the importance of the center lane?
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.560]   You know, you might think, well, gosh,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.120]   if there's a way to optimize,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.400]   isn't the optimal answer the better way, right?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300]   You know, shouldn't I at least try to optimize
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.640]   rather than just, you know, splitting the difference
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.800]   or going with some middle road?
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.980]   So let's look at the importance of the center lane.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.400]   Does anyone know who this fellow is?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.960]   Anyone identify him?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.120]   Okay, not surprising.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.680]   His name is Ronald Wayne, and he was a co-founder of Apple
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.640]   along with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.080]   But the reason why no one recognized him,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.960]   we don't talk about him a lot, he's still alive,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.360]   is because he sold out after just 12 days.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.080]   The reasons are a little bit lost to history.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.600]   Apparently, one explanation is that
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.840]   Steve Jobs just made him nervous.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.660]   He's like, how can I work with this guy?
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.660]   And so he sold out, and you can look this up on Wikipedia,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.000]   I don't think anyone debates it,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   he was paid $2,300 for his shares.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.300]   Today, Apple, as you know, worth more than three trillion.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.240]   So you could look at this and say,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.160]   well, that's probably one of the biggest financial mistakes
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.840]   anyone has ever made, ever.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   But on the other hand, you'd say,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   well, gosh, that's with the benefit of hindsight.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.320]   And Wayne himself, in an interview, once said,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.160]   nobody could have anticipated how big Apple would become.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.720]   And that's true, hindsight can be unkind.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   But I would like to argue that even Ronald Wayne,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.440]   with the information that he had available to him
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.320]   at the time when they were just getting started,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   he could have made a different decision.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.600]   So he started with 10%.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   If Steve Jobs made him nervous, he could have said,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.960]   well, I'm gonna go down at 5%, or I'll go down to 1%,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.600]   or I need to change the working relationship here,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.520]   or the corporate structure,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   so that I can still remain a shareholder
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.800]   and potentially benefit,
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.040]   but not have to deal with whatever the dynamics were
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.880]   in the office.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   And so that's what I mean by the center lane.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.600]   So the Wayne case is extreme,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.360]   but these kinds of things happen all the time.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.840]   Let's look at another example.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.200]   This is a map of Fort Lauderdale.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.500]   And if you can see in the upper right there,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.840]   there's that area which is just sort of trees and wilderness.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.680]   And that's known as Bonnet House.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   It's a very nice 35-acre parcel in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.640]   And it used to be the winter home of the Bartlett family.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   A woman named Evelyn Bartlett lived there with her husband
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.480]   from the 1930s.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.080]   And by the 1980s, though, she was widowed,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.480]   and the property obviously had ballooned in value,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.380]   and she had a hard time keeping up with the real estate taxes.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.160]   So she went to the city, and she said,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.240]   look, I'm having a hard time with the taxes.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.760]   I will give you this property in my will,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   but in exchange, can I live here tax-free
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.840]   for the rest of my life?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   So the city took one look at the property,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.080]   and they took one look at Mrs. Bartlett,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.660]   who at the time was 95 years old,
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.380]   and they immediately accepted.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.020]   So what happened?
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.760]   Mrs. Bartlett went on to live until the age of 109.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.160]   And so apparently, according to accounts,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.400]   because the property was so valuable, it was enormous,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.880]   she avoided tens of millions of dollars in property taxes.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.040]   And so Mrs. Bartlett got the better end of the deal.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.880]   And so this is another example,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.600]   kind of like the Ronald Wayne case.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   Could this city have done something different?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.400]   What her proposal was, I don't want to pay any taxes at all,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.640]   and they accepted it.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   What they could have done is to say,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.200]   well, I don't know, you're 95,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.960]   but maybe you've got some time left here,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.160]   and so we'll make a deal with you.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.360]   We'll cut your taxes by 30% or 50%.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.520]   In other words, it didn't need to be a binary choice.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.200]   It didn't need to be all or nothing.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.120]   So as I said, these examples occur all the time.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.420]   So we'll look at one more.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.600]   I have a friend, his name is Danny,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.160]   and he's authorized me to use his first name
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.240]   and not his last name.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.320]   He's a smart guy.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.400]   He went to Harvard.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.480]   He has more than one degree from Harvard,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.360]   and now he's an economics professor.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   But in the winter of his sophomore year,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.280]   he made a financial mistake.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.320]   So a group of his friends were putting money
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.600]   into a startup that another guy in their dorm
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.240]   had just launched.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   You may see where I'm going with this.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.400]   And Danny took one look at it,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.720]   and that's, he said, this is the dumbest idea in the world.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.160]   And so he did not invest.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.720]   The classmate, of course, Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.360]   And so Danny and I have talked about this over the years.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   And as an economist, he's pretty thoughtful about it.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   And sure, we have the same problem as with Ronald Wayne.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.200]   There's the hindsight problem.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.800]   But I think Danny agrees
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.680]   that he could have made a different decision.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   I don't know how much savings he had as a college sophomore,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.840]   but he could have said, well, this seems dumb to me,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.080]   but I don't know, other people might like it,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.720]   so maybe I'll put something into it.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.000]   So again, doesn't need to be a binary decision.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.440]   He could have taken a middle path.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.880]   That's what I call the center lane.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.400]   And so what exactly does this mean?
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.560]   If you were Ronald Wayne or the city of Fort Lauderdale
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   or my friend Danny, what could you have done?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   What are the alternatives exactly?
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.920]   So I keep referring to splitting the difference.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.640]   And is that the only answer?
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.560]   And so I think there's a distinction to be made
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.360]   when you're making financial decisions,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.040]   which is that there are some decisions
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.760]   where there really is no data to go on.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   There is no logical basis
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.960]   on which to make a determination.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.400]   So in this example here,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.360]   you're splitting the last piece of pie.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.440]   In my house with all boys, it's not always fair
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.480]   how the division goes,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.720]   but that's the sort of situation where you'd say,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.320]   well, just split it evenly.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.920]   But there are lots of other cases,
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.080]   and I think this applies to a lot of financial decisions
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.600]   where you could say, well, it shouldn't just be 50/50.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   So splitting the difference
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.640]   really is not the right way to go.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.200]   And what are some financial decisions
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   that are sort of like splitting the pie?
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.680]   It might be, say you're considering a Roth conversion
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.360]   and you do the math and you say,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840]   well, my tax rate today
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.520]   is probably gonna be pretty similar
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.280]   to my tax rate in the future.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.800]   And so it doesn't really argue strongly
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.040]   one way or the other.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.400]   And so in that case, you might just split the difference.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.320]   But there are other cases where you say,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.040]   well, there is some data to go on
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.200]   and let's use a different approach.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   So this book was published last year.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.160]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with Cass Sunstein.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.200]   He's an academic.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   He's actually co-authored
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.440]   with a number of pretty well-known folks,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.560]   including Danny Kahneman in behavioral finance.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.960]   And so in this book, he offers one suggestion.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.720]   He talks about when you're trying to weigh a decision,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.000]   he says, weigh the cost of being wrong
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.080]   versus the benefit of being right.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.760]   The cost of being wrong against the benefit of being right.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.120]   And those are both easier to kind of get your arms around
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.640]   than just simply trying to predict the future
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.000]   with nothing else to go on.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.880]   Because at least you can say,
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.600]   if you think back to whether it was Ronald Wayne
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.120]   or Danny or anyone else,
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.080]   you could say, well, let me try to put some numbers on this.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.040]   And so suppose you were Ronald Wayne.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.080]   He looked at Apple and he said,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   okay, well, I see the computer error is starting.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.280]   This could be big.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.920]   Obviously, a company worth trillions,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.880]   no one ever could have estimated that.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.400]   But he could have said,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.520]   what if the company is worth 500,000
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.120]   or even a million at some point?
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.840]   That wouldn't have been an unreasonable guess.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.040]   And then he could have done the math and said,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.520]   well, what will my 10% share be worth?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.440]   And it probably would have come out to way more
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.840]   than the 2,300 that he received.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.240]   So that's one approach that you can take is to just say,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.640]   well, let me put some numbers on this.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   A similar example, when it comes to Facebook,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.920]   I remember talking to a pretty well-known venture capitalist
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.360]   was in 2005, so just a year after they got started.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.440]   But Facebook, if you remember,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.200]   it got off to a pretty quick start.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   And he looked at it and he said,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.040]   yeah, based on other types of deals and IPOs,
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   he said, I think the company would be worth 300 million.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.920]   And if I'm doing my math right, I think he was way off.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.800]   He was off by a factor of 5,000.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.560]   So Facebook's now worth more than 1 trillion.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.520]   But if you had done that math,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.320]   and even though he was way, way off,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.960]   it would have led you to a decision
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.080]   that was in the right direction.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.320]   And so I think that this is an important idea,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.200]   which is just to say, well, what's the cost of being wrong
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.720]   versus the benefit of being right?
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.200]   And often with investments,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.560]   especially as the previous speakers were talking about,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.880]   if you have a diversified portfolio,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.360]   you're not talking about putting your entire net worth
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.480]   into something which is unproven.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.960]   You're talking about making some bet.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.000]   And hopefully it's a reasonable size bet.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.160]   But the key is to think about,
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.680]   well, what would be the upside?
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   And not just to dismiss it, like Danny and say,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.160]   well, that's the dumbest idea in the world.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.440]   And so therefore it's gotta be worth zero.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.160]   Okay, let's look at another framework.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.000]   Another approach,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.300]   if you're thinking about a financial decision,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.080]   is to say, well, how much do I need this to work?
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.160]   So in the prior slide,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.600]   what we were looking at is to think about the upside.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.160]   Now we wanna also think about the downside, right?
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.380]   And risk management.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.440]   And so if you think about it, in this case,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.260]   this person here really needs this bridge to hold.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.160]   And so let's put that in financial terms.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.320]   Suppose you're trying to make an asset allocation decision.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.800]   And just as an illustration, let's imagine two people.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   One is Bill Gates and one is more like an average person.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.360]   So when it comes to Bill Gates,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.960]   he could have it all in socks
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.920]   or he could have it all under his mattress, right?
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   It wouldn't matter either way.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.280]   There are costs to being at either extreme,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.340]   but it wouldn't hurt him.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.660]   But if you look at the sort of more average person,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.280]   suppose it's somebody who doesn't have a lot of savings
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.640]   and it's a young person.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.480]   They just have some cash in the bank
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.820]   and they're looking to put a down payment on a home.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.640]   Well, in that case,
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.440]   that probably should remain entirely in cash.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.340]   There's no reason that that person
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.100]   should be investing in the stock market
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.160]   because the risk of loss is too extreme.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.460]   And if they need to put the down payment down anytime soon,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.400]   then that's just an intolerable loss.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.080]   And so I think that's another filter,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.020]   which is how much does this decision matter?
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.160]   Okay, that's the theory, but how do we apply this?
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.720]   Let's look in some more detail
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.160]   at some common financial questions.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.540]   We'll start with the Boglehead.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.760]   I don't know if you saw the article
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.560]   that Mike Piper published.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.120]   I believe it was last year.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.560]   And he compared asset allocation to making a fruit salad.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.260]   And if you haven't read this, it's a classic.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.120]   And he says, if you put in more blueberries,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.680]   he says, nothing magical happens,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.120]   nor is there any disaster.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   And it's a great way of describing diversification.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.540]   And I think that people really beat each other up
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.800]   over a lot of decisions.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.160]   And we saw it in the prior discussion
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.840]   about should I have 20% in international
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.440]   or should I have 30%?
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.280]   Some people say, well, have the market weight
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.660]   in international, 40 or 50%.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.920]   Or how about growth versus value?
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.000]   Should I have a tilt there?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.200]   Does it matter?
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.680]   Is there gonna be mean reversion?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.720]   And I think that people, they beat each other up about this
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   and they kind of go round and round.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.040]   But if you go back to Cass Sunstein,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.280]   just think about what would be the cost of being wrong?
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.160]   Or if you wanna go back to my old boss,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.000]   just think about the importance
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.120]   or I should say the impact of recency bias.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   It's really powerful.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.240]   And in recent years, I don't know how many times
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.920]   people have said, why don't I just put it all
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.360]   on the S&P 500?
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.800]   Why am I messing around with any of this other stuff?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.760]   It looks like that's just the simple,
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.440]   that's the easy button, just put all on the S&P 500.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   And so I think it is, I would echo what Christine had said
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.760]   in her discussions with other advisors
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.000]   that it is the hardest thing to convince people
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.680]   to keep putting money into something
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.920]   which has just been practically a perennial loser,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.320]   whether it's value stocks or international.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.160]   But my view and sort of the center lane approach
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.000]   would be to say, well, don't go too far out on a limb
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.560]   in any one direction, right?
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   And I think the recency bias is a good caution
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.920]   for everybody because if you decide,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.480]   well, you know what, forget everything else,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.160]   I'll just put it all on the S&P 500.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.420]   Well, things can change and it's better to remain balanced.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.080]   Another perspective on asset allocation
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.440]   comes from Morgan Housel, he described an old coach
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.160]   and he said, 1/3 of your days should feel good,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.000]   1/3 should feel okay and 1/3 should feel terrible.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.720]   He says, if it's always terrible, you're doing it wrong,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.400]   if it's always great, then also you're not doing it right.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   And I think that's also another important perspective
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.640]   on diversification, right?
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.560]   Which is that there's the expression that certainly
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.880]   from the financial advisor's perspective
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.000]   that having a diversified portfolio
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.840]   means that you're always apologizing for something.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.080]   Every year it's something different
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.120]   that you have to apologize for,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.120]   but I think whether you're working with an advisor
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.400]   or managing your own portfolio
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.920]   and just maybe apologizing to your own spouse or to yourself
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.420]   the idea is just keep going with the diversification
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.400]   because if you become too convinced in any one direction,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.460]   that's often when things turn around.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.620]   We'll look at a few more cases.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.080]   So how could you apply the center lane approach
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.160]   to the sort of magnificent seven situation?
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.160]   So actually Christine asked about direct indexing.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.640]   And so this is something that has grown in popularity.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.720]   Vanguard, I believe it was Vanguard's first
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.160]   and only acquisition so far in 50 years
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.480]   was to acquire a direct indexing company.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   And so I think there are definitely costs and complexity
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   which were discussed, but there are also some benefits.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.440]   There can be a tax benefit.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.920]   It can allow you to tilt your portfolio
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.140]   or to have screens in different ways.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.440]   If you wanted to include the S&P 500
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   minus the tobacco companies,
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.320]   you could have the S&P 497 or 98
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.800]   and that might suit your values better.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.200]   So there are reasons why direct indexing can matter
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.960]   or it can be valuable, but we shouldn't view it
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   as something that we feel that we shouldn't do
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.840]   right, I mean, we're all indexing diehards,
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.880]   but at the end of the day, it's not a religion.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.020]   It's not our spouse.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.240]   We're not cheating if we say, okay,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.920]   well, we'll do something that's a little bit different
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.440]   in addition to a kind of core portfolio
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.320]   that's built on indexing.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.760]   And so I think that's another way in which you can say,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.220]   well, I can make a balanced decision here.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.560]   We'll look at just a few more cases.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.160]   This one of my favorite cartoons is a little hard to read,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.640]   but it's basically showing,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.620]   it's the perspective of a New Yorker
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.100]   and their perspective on the rest of the world.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.840]   And so you can see beyond the Hudson River to them,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.320]   it's sort of like, then the next thing is the Pacific Ocean
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.180]   and then China and Japan.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.000]   And I think what this illustrates is that,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.160]   and Jonathan said this in the previous session also,
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   that the question of international diversification
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.360]   is often an active decision.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.200]   And so many of us feel like,
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.000]   okay, well, let's just have the market wait.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   And that actually is the Vanguard view.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.120]   Jack Bogle himself though, personally,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.680]   always said that his own portfolio was 100% domestic.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.920]   He said, what do I need the rest of the world for?
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   The S&P 500 is perfectly fine,
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.580]   or the total market is totally sufficient.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.400]   And I think this is another area
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.960]   in which it's important to take a balanced view
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.560]   and to say, well, there are reasons
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.320]   to not be home biased, but there are also reasons
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.820]   why maybe because my bills are in dollars,
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.720]   I do wanna have a portfolio
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.680]   which is biased toward domestic stocks.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.120]   And so again, there's no one right answer here.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.980]   And I don't think home bias is a crime.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.600]   Global market rate waiting
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.520]   is also not necessarily right or wrong.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.160]   We'll look at just a few more examples.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.220]   This here is a poll that I did a little while back.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.240]   And I asked, is the total market bond fund,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.400]   I said BND specifically, is that sufficient?
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.560]   Is that sort of the perfect bond portfolio?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.640]   And here again, this is another area
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.440]   in which I don't disagree with anything anyone else said.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.320]   What Jonathan described and Christine also added to
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.640]   is to say, well, don't just hold a total bond fund.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.200]   And you can see that three quarters of people said,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.440]   don't do that, and I would agree.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.740]   You wanna break it up a little bit, right?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.400]   Because there are different types of bonds,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.700]   government versus corporate, there's different durations,
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.480]   and they behave differently in 2022, we saw that.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.160]   You can also buy individual bonds versus bond funds.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.680]   And so, again, this is an area
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.760]   where people beat each other up,
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.880]   but is anyone the right or wrong answer?
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.160]   No, I think that each plays a role in a portfolio.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   And so, we're running short on time,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   so I will move quickly here.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.220]   In terms of the Magnificent Seven,
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.560]   this is another area where you don't have to have
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.080]   a sort of left lane, right lane,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.680]   binary approach to things.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.920]   If you have an individual stock,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.120]   which a lot of people do,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.560]   even though there's the tendency
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.280]   to talk about winners and not losers,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.240]   but there are a lot of people walking around
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.960]   who ended up with some Apple shares, some Amazon shares,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.480]   and say, I have a huge tax problem.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.080]   It doesn't need to be just,
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.840]   I'll either sell it or I'll hold it,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.460]   there are lots of other ways to split the difference.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.260]   You could donate some to a donor buys fund,
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.800]   you could donate some to family members
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.060]   with lower tax brackets,
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.280]   you could sell some incrementally,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.720]   there are lots of ways to do it.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.960]   And so, that's the message really,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.480]   is just always try and look for ways
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.740]   to not go too far out on a limb.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.880]   And here, just a quick thought on portfolio construction.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.920]   So, the guys on the right,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.160]   sort of like a diversified portfolio, right?
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   The guys on the upper left,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.680]   not a lot of diversity there, right?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.320]   And not very interesting.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.440]   And I think this is another key way
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.240]   to think about diversification,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.760]   is just to say, well, let's not go too far out
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.120]   in any one direction and let's not be too sure.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.680]   I think people lost some faith in bonds,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.640]   but there's a value in having bonds.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.280]   And so, I'll move to,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.640]   I'll skip over this and come to a conclusion.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.480]   So,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.600]   sometimes one of the hardest decisions
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.380]   is something where you say,
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.680]   it looks crazy,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.920]   and maybe it's like my friend, Danny,
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   you say, it looks crazy,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.200]   or maybe even, it just looks like the most terrible thing.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.360]   And I've gone on record criticizing Bitcoin,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.020]   I think as early as 2017,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.800]   but probably what I should have done was to buy some, right?
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.680]   But I say that only half jokingly,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.960]   which is that, what I've developed over the years
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.480]   is what I sometimes call the $1,000 rule.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.160]   And the number can vary, but the idea is,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.680]   well, if you think something is crazy,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   but you also feel like you might kick yourself later,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.840]   and maybe I'm wrong,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.880]   and maybe it actually does turn into something
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.080]   which is legitimate,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.200]   then put something small into it.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.560]   Again, going back to the Cass Sunstein theory, right?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.040]   Is there a way that I can place a small bet here?
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.760]   And maybe if it turns out to be right,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   then it will really benefit you.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   And so, I'm glad my wife isn't in the audience,
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.440]   so I can admit that the first time I looked at Bitcoin,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.320]   it was at $65.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   And so now it's, I don't know if it's 50, 60,000 today.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.640]   So I wish I had followed the $1,000 rule myself at the time.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.040]   I did not.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.320]   But I think that's another way
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.120]   in which you can apply the concept of the center lane.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.800]   And so I'll wrap up there.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.360]   I appreciate your questions,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.100]   and I'm not sure if we'll have time for questions,
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.000]   but I will be around and happy to speak with folks.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.400]   - Okay, let's give Adam a round of applause.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   (audience applauds)
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.760]   The good news is, well, the bad news
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.800]   is we don't have time for questions.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.440]   The good news is like the first three
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.560]   you answered right at the end.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.860]   So it was beautiful.
