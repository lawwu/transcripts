[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   We're really excited to have our next speaker here.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.700]   Nate Silver is the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.420]   And he came to our poker game recently.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.140]   Oh, Nate came to our game.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.240]   Come on out, Nate.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.560]   Ran the game over.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.240]   See you, Rob.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.780]   Good morning.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.320]   Who was the big loser that night?
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560]   I think, wait, who was the big loser?
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.840]   Because Nate was the big winner, right?
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.640]   Well, he was the big winner.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540]   I was basically trying to kind of break even.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480]   I think I donated a little bit to Nate Silver's new Model S Plaid.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.080]   Model Y, Model S Plaid.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.340]   I think he got the Model S Plaid coming to the game.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.400]   This was the largest poker win you've had in your life.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.120]   Largest cash game win, yeah.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.440]   By a factor of five?
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.600]   Two.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.460]   Two, okay.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.380]   Well, we're happy to donate.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.320]   You're getting, by the way, your speaker fee, I just canceled it.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.580]   Okay.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.740]   But ladies and gentlemen, Nate Silver on The Mind of a Gambler.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.140]   Cool.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:23.660]   I'm really excited to talk to y'all today. I'm working on a book about gambling, risk,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.460]   and rationality. I prefer the term critical thinking to rationality. It's partly involved
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.220]   talking to people about global societal risks, so talking to people about the risk of nuclear
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.520]   war, which is not very cheery conversations, by the way. But also people who take risk
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.640]   for a living or at the very least manage risk and have real skin in the game. They're not
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.740]   just some actuary getting a salary. They're assessing risk and making big decisions financially
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.540]   mostly based on that assessment. So I've started out talking to poker players
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.780]   and sports bettors. I'm a former poker player myself. I still play
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.660]   recreationally a lot. I'm currently I think number 301 in the global poker rankings. Not
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.560]   that I look that up every morning. But mostly it's the examples of talking to other fantastic
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.860]   poker players and sports bettors about their process. And I'm also talking now more to
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.020]   VCs, to founders, to hedge fund managers, for example.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.380]   There are a lot of similarities. There's a certain type of person. That's what I'm talking
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.100]   about today. Personality traits, modes of thinking. It even affects
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.200]   maybe their political views a little bit. And you see a lot of things in common.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.220]   So I gave you some of this context already. This is a work in progress. I mean, the book
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.900]   is kind of halfway, 0% written, about 50% research. So things may change. I'm evolving
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.700]   and learning and correcting things. But it's fun to write a book. It's fun to have great
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.660]   conversations with the besties and other people and really kind of experience this firsthand.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.160]   So I'm going to start with some things that I think are relatively straightforward and
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.200]   obvious and then get into things that are maybe less so toward the end. But one really
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.620]   obvious one is that successful gamblers think probabilistically. It's not just a matter
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.480]   of understanding probability, but being comfortable with uncertainty, being willing to take bets
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.680]   on an uncertain basis. That's kind of table stakes for even getting into any field involving
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.840]   risk. In poker, at least, you probably also need
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.480]   a fair amount of mathematical ability. There are now these things called solvers in poker.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.560]   They come up with a game theory optimal strategy for every situation. It's a very complex situation.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's way too hard to memorize. You have to kind of develop a mathematical intuition behind
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.240]   it. But even players with rare exception-- Phil Hellmuth might be the one exception,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   actually, right? But even players who are known as being field players or exploitive
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.800]   players, people who rely on tells and psychology and table talk. I talked to Daniel Negreanu,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   for example, one of the probably five best poker players of all time. And he told me
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.580]   that about four years ago, he realized that these solver kids, as he calls them, the math
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.100]   whizzes were better than him, at least at certain forms of poker. And he totally remade
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.520]   his game to look at computer solutions, to be more studious and mathematical. And it's
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.060]   improved his results quite a bit. In the VC field, I don't know if you're necessarily
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.480]   doing as much modeling as I might in an election model, for example. But at the very least,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.120]   people understand the intuition. And the intuition is-- you need both, but I think the intuition
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   is more important than the application. So I'm going to talk about that a little bit.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.420]   Number two, this one ought to be really obvious, but it needs to be said. Successful gamblers
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.160]   are highly competitive. Things that you hear from people over and over again is, I want
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.660]   to kind of prove people wrong. I want to outsmart the competition. I want to show who's best.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.340]   It's almost more this motivation than financial motivation, I think. It's partly a matter
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.440]   of you can't settle for being average as a gambler. The average poker player loses money
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.140]   to the house, so does the average sports bettor. So therefore, you have to deviate from average
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.180]   in some ways. But kind of one conclusion I've come to talking to people for this book is
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.980]   that human beings are a competitive species, right? To get people to get along in society
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.420]   is pretty hard. One good thing about capitalism is that you have some managed type of competition.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.440]   Democracy is kind of a type of competition. And that's probably a better way to kind of
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.760]   challenge these conflicting urges we have than things that are too centrally planned.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.520]   But certainly people in this room, people I talk to are on the high end of the competitive
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.200]   scale. Successful poker players and sports bettors have to care a lot about small edges.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.300]   It's the nature of placing bets in a field where you lose money on average. So a very
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.760]   good sports bettor might win 55 or so percent of his or her bets. You have to win 52 and
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.660]   a half percent to make up for the house cut for the rake or the vig as different names.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.300]   That means you can't afford to make 1% errors, right? You really have to squeeze every last
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.840]   drop of expected value or EV out of any situation that you're in. This makes people very, very,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.180]   very detail-oriented. Poker players tend to be very studious about their craft. They really
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.240]   kind of love poker. You can't just get the big things right in poker. You have to get
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.080]   the small things right, too. It's too competitive a field right now.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.760]   This might not be as true, by the way, of VC. The average investment makes money. It
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.920]   may not make an above-market return, but it'll make money, which is not true for the average
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.580]   poker hand that you play. By the way, casinos, too, if you talk to casino executives, you
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.600]   might think you walk into a casino and everything that you do is maximized to make the maximum
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.960]   amount of revenue possible. Not really, right? They're pretty good at the big stuff. They
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.400]   protect their downside risk a lot. But they're not maximized as much as they should. They're
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.540]   not maximized as much as you would think because when you have a license to make money, you
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.640]   don't have to get the small stuff right. But in poker, where only 10% of players probably
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.780]   make money in the long run, you have to be very, very detail-oriented.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.880]   Number four, you see here a Paul Graham thread about Elon, actually. Successful gamblers
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   are contrarian, at least to some degree. And again, I'm kind of repeating myself a little
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.720]   bit, but there's no edge if everyone does the same thing in the same way. You have to have some
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.260]   angle that you think makes you better than what the market thinks. And the market's pretty
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:22.000]   good, so it's a hard thing to manage. I think risk-takers tend to view themselves as outsiders,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.620]   whether they are or not is probably an open question. What they think of themselves as
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.220]   thinking differently from the rest of the world, potentially. This can also make them
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.760]   potentially a little bit annoying outside of investing and gambling context, where if
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.040]   you're always the person who says, "Well, actually, that can get pushed back in social settings," for example, or on top of that.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.220]   But you can't kind of settle for having the average view because the average view doesn't do better than the market.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:56.040]   There is a fine line between being ahead of the curve and a permanent contrarian. In sports betting,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.940]   there's a line that's constantly mispriced. Then I can just bet that I don't want that
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.160]   market to correct itself. I want to keep exploiting that error in pricing, right?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.360]   In VC, I mean, you might want to find a founder or a sector or a company that's undervalued by the market.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.440]   But eventually you want that sector to grow. You want to attract more talent. You want to attract future fundraising rounds.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.040]   So you kind of are more being ahead of the curve by half a year to a year.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.680]   I think in some ways it's analogous to real estate. We are trying to kind of anticipate where the market will be in the future.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:36.060]   And that's a subtly different skill than being maybe contrarian per se, but related at least.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.680]   Number five, and again, this might be a little bit redundant, but successful gamblers tend to be
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.800]   more competitive. They're more competitive in terms of their ability to take shots.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.000]   And this is very intuitive in VC where you have a field where you might only have a unicorn or decacorn,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   you know, 1% of the time or 10% of the time. Of course, you have a whole portfolio.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It may not be that risky in the aggregate, but you have to be willing to make decisions under pressure
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and be somewhat fearless as a result, right? Timing is important. You want to be first to market.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   In poker, you have a finite amount of time you can spend on a hand in practice.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Sometimes people take these risks in a calculated way, right? I talked to Sam Beckman-Fried for the book, for example,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and he's like, "Yeah, I knew this would have like only a 50% chance of succeeding, but the payoff was so high, I would take it."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Some people just kind of more intuitively just kind of want to put skin in the game, want to take risks, get some excitement or pleasure from it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Again, we're talking about the very extreme tails here too, right?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The people who are super uber successful maybe are almost taking on more risk than they maybe should.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.320]   You can instead likely have a very happy life.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   You can be happy and complacent life as an investment banker or something, but people who are true entrepreneurs think at scale and think very, very big.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   I should say one challenge of writing the book is that talking only to successful people, you risk survivorship bias, right?
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   So kind of which people fell along by the wayside.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   If you know unsuccessful investors or gamblers, then send them my way. I need to talk to some of them as well.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.640]   Number six, successful gamblers, especially in poker,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   work well with incomplete information.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   One thing that differentiates kind of people in academia, and academia is very useful for basic research and for advancing science and things like that, right?
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   But you don't get months and months and years and years to develop a hypothesis when there's actual money on the line.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   By that time, the people who were faster will already have moved.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   So the skill is kind of knowing what information was available at the time you made the decision.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   I think there is a limit to how useful like an after-sales decision is.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   So I think that's kind of what the answer to the question is.
