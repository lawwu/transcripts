[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.620]   "He's a friend, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt,
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.960]   "former MMA fighter, and at least in my opinion,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.300]   "one of the great UFC cornerman coaches to listen to.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.180]   "And also, he's my current jiu-jitsu coach
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.580]   "at Broadway Jiu-Jitsu in South Boston.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140]   "He was once, for a time, a philosophy major in college,
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.300]   "and is now, I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher,
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.340]   "opinionated, brilliant,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.300]   "and someone I always enjoy talking to,
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.360]   "even when, especially when, we disagree,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.080]   "which we do often.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.980]   "He's definitely someone I can see talking to
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.900]   "many times on this podcast.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.240]   "In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.740]   "called Please Allow Me.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.400]   "Quick mention of each sponsor,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.820]   "followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.860]   "Thank you to Theragun,

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.020]   "and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep,

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   "As a side note, let me say that martial arts,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.020]   "especially jiu-jitsu and judo,
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.860]   "have been a big part of my growth as a human being.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.260]   "So I think I will talk to a few martial artists
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.180]   "on occasion on this podcast.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420]   "I hope that is of interest to you.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.820]   "I won't talk to people who are simply great fighters
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940]   "or great athletes, but people who have a philosophy
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.540]   "that I find to be interesting and worth exploring,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.420]   "even if I disagree with parts or most of it.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.340]   "I like alternating between historians
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.320]   "and computer scientists, fighters and biologists,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.900]   "and between totally different world views and personalities
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.240]   "like Elon Musk and Michael Malice.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.220]   "This world, to me, is fascinating
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.700]   "because of the diversity of weirdness
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.820]   "that is human civilization.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.280]   "I love the weird and the brilliant,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.500]   "and hope you join me on the journey of exploring both.

[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260]   "For an OCD person like myself,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060]   "sometimes not listening to a podcast episode
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.940]   "is an act of courage.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.340]   "It's like not finishing a book
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520]   "even though you're 80% done.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.100]   "Try it sometimes.

[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.900]   "and don't listen to the ones you don't like.

[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.840]   "And now, here's my conversation with John Clark."
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.220]   You ready for this?
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.700]   - I've been ready for this my whole life.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.520]   - All right.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.020]   I was thinking of doing a Kerouac-style road trip
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.500]   across the United States,
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.900]   after this whole COVID thing lifts.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780]   You ever take a trip like that?
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.780]   - I've done a handful of long-distance driving trips
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.420]   up and down the East Coast,
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.500]   but also from the West Coast back to the East Coast,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.580]   and then returning to California.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.640]   So I've definitely done my fair share of driving
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.540]   in this country.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.460]   - Do you have the longing for the Great American Road Trip?
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.380]   - I think there are so many things
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.540]   that I've been lucky enough to see in the world
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.060]   that I now, at this point in my life,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.900]   realize there are tons of things
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.300]   that I need to see here in this country.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.780]   And a road trip could potentially be the best way
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.660]   to see them.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.020]   I think to do it effectively,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.180]   you need an amount of time
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580]   where you can be as leisurely as possible.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.500]   There's no deadline, and there's no,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   I've got to make it from Chicago to St. Louis by sundown
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.540]   to get to this place at this time.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.980]   I think you really need to be able to take your time
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.980]   and kind of let the road take you where you need to go.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.220]   - It feels like you need a mission, though, ultimately.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.180]   There's a reason you need to be in San Francisco.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.780]   That's like the Kerouac thing.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420]   You have to meet somebody somewhere,
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.020]   kind of loosely in a few weeks,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.020]   and then it's the, as you struggle on towards that mission,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.540]   you meet weird characters that get in your way,
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.540]   but ultimately sort of create an experience.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.620]   - I think having a loose deadline is good,
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.100]   but that's a beginning and an end point.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.540]   And what I mean is I don't want to have to be,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.300]   all right, we're leaving, say, Boston on Sunday night.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.220]   Let's get to New York by Monday morning,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.700]   and then from New York, we're going to go to Philly,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.820]   and we've got to be in Philly at four.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120]   A vague beginning and end is fine,
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.540]   but I think having very strict guidelines in between
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.820]   will rob you of certain experiences along the way.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.900]   - If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.100]   and some awesome shit starts to happen in Philly,
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.460]   do you really want to have to cut it short
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.300]   because you've got to be in Indianapolis by sunup?
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.700]   - Why do you have to be anywhere by any time
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.260]   for any reason, really?
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.540]   Plans change.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.020]   - Plans change all the time, exactly.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.180]   But if we're talking about having a mission
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.980]   or the type of road trip,
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.100]   I just think it would be best to have it
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.700]   as loose and flexible as possible.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.540]   - I don't know.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.340]   You've got to make hard deadlines and then break them.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.500]   Totally change the plans, disappoint people,
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.700]   break promises.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.100]   That's the way of life.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.220]   Somebody's waiting for you in St. Louis,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.580]   and all of a sudden you fell in love
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.660]   with a biker in New York.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.500]   I don't know.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.460]   I don't know what you're up to.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.700]   - I can appreciate that,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.120]   but on a trip like that, I feel like a trip with deadlines
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.940]   is for a different point in your life.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.000]   And at this point in my life,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.500]   I don't want any of the deadlines
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.780]   because it's not about meeting someone
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.660]   and disappointing them in St. Louis.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.360]   It's about me not disappointing myself.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.380]   You want to have enough time in what you're doing
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.540]   to make sure that you get the full breadth
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.840]   of every experience that you encounter.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.380]   - How would you fully experience a place?
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.220]   How would you?
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.180]   I don't think I've actually fully experienced Boston.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.120]   If you were showing up to a city for a week
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.460]   on this road trip, what would you do?
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.620]   - So I'm gonna answer that in two parts.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.100]   A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.380]   and the thing that kept me here,
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   no question about it was the fact that I felt like
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.340]   I had a contract with my students.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.540]   And I did not, I felt like a great many of them
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.300]   took a leap of faith by joining my gym
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.340]   and asking me to teach them what I know.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.380]   And when I had an opportunity to leave Boston,
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.260]   I thought of those people and I thought,
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.580]   I want to fulfill my obligation to them.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.860]   So because I made a decision to stay here,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.500]   I then that summer made a decision to endear myself
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.480]   to the city of Boston.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.380]   And I tried to find lots and lots of different things to do.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.700]   I can tell you that the coolest thing that I found to do
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.560]   in this city is the MFA,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.580]   where they have like on Friday nights,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.460]   they'll have like different exhibits and stuff.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.180]   And they'll have like little beer carts and food tents
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.080]   and you can go do a painting class off on the side,
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.700]   very cool night of things to do.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.620]   But in general, whenever I'm in a new city,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.620]   I try not to pay attention to Google
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.180]   and I try not to do anything that I find on a travel site.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.220]   The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.540]   or wherever it is you're staying
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.260]   and find the most normal looking bar,
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.300]   have a drink and talk to a bartender.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.020]   - So the people, the people.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.460]   - The people, and then you can experience that town
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.580]   the way that they experience it.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.900]   Even in a city where there are tons of tourist attractions,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.300]   locals probably visit the same tourist attractions
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.140]   when they have visitors come from out of town.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.740]   You wanna see how they view those places
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.100]   and how they visit them.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.700]   And you wanna go to eat where they're going to eat.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   Like, you're gonna, for the most part,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.140]   the North end is not a place where I would take someone
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.540]   and say, "Hey, this is Boston's,
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.380]   the pinnacle of Boston dining."
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.460]   'Cause it's very touristy.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.360]   There are a handful of really good restaurants there,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.580]   but I wanna know where the,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.900]   I wanna go to Bogie's Place.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.540]   I wanna know like the down low spots where-
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.580]   - The hell's Bogie's Place?
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.100]   - It's like a little steakhouse in the back of JM Curley's.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.940]   - Exactly.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.740]   - It's like a shitty bar, the JM Curley's?
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.140]   - It's just a bar with like bar food.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.340]   But I think that like-
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.420]   - It's not Boston?
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.260]   - It is in Boston, yeah.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.260]   - It's not South Boston?
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.780]   - No, it's in the downtown area.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.900]   I don't know what the neighborhoods are called here,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.300]   honestly, because they have an area called Downtown Boston,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.140]   and I don't even know what the hell that means.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.340]   I think it's near the financial district.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.500]   - Where's Southie?
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.140]   'Cause I've heard about the Southie.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.060]   - Southie is South Boston.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.460]   - But is there a difference between South Boston and Southie?
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.820]   - No, it's the same thing.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.420]   - No, but like, you know, the mythical Southie.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.340]   - I think the mythical Southie
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.100]   is something that's long gone now.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.020]   And the term now actually is Sobo.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.860]   - Oh no.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.700]   - Yeah, it's-
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.860]   - It's changed what, who took over what?
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.300]   What's the, you know, the goodwill hunting personality?
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.340]   That's Southie, isn't it?
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.500]   Strong accent, those bad-ass dudes.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.900]   - I came here right at the end of like
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.340]   what was South Boston.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.140]   So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.580]   the neighborhood was just starting to change.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.580]   So I think as gentrification happened
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.960]   and they started building more luxury condominiums,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.700]   they were buying all these old businesses out,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.940]   all the mom and pop businesses.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.580]   And I think that kind of changed
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.900]   the makeup of the community.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.020]   And it wasn't only because there was an influx
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.260]   of new young people with disposable income,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.300]   it's because there's an exodus of the older people
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.900]   who kind of grew up and raised their families there
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.180]   because they were being offered
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.100]   humongous sums of money for their homes
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.580]   that they had bought like in the late '70s and early '80s
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.300]   so that they could develop those areas.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.100]   So you have a combination of the influx of new people
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.580]   and the exodus of the old,
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.740]   and now you just got this totally new neighborhood
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.980]   in its place.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.620]   - What do you love about Boston?
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.480]   Is there a love still for Boston?
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.340]   You certainly have the love of the thing
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.860]   that's gone as well.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.140]   - Yeah, I think, I don't wanna pin this on Boston
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.100]   because it's happening in all great cities.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.220]   As these areas become gentrified,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.740]   what's happening is the personality
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.020]   and the character of the neighborhood
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   is just being run out.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.980]   And I have nothing against people coming in
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.300]   and making money and things like that.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.460]   But when you do it at the expense of the culture,
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.460]   the character and the personality of the neighborhood,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.220]   I mean, you're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.420]   These are the people that came here
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.260]   and built these areas up.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.860]   It happens here in Boston,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.620]   it happens in all over New York,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.740]   happened on the West Coast.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.240]   So what I love about Boston is not nearly as romantic
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.060]   as what it might've been 15 years ago
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.140]   and what I used to love about New York.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.100]   What I love about Boston is that it's walkable.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.460]   The food scene is on the rise here,
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.660]   but I think you're hard pressed to find the charm
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.460]   that people think of when they think of old Boston
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.660]   and old New England city.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.900]   - See, I see it differently.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.180]   People sometimes criticize like MIT
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.460]   for the thing that it is now,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.640]   but I think it is always like that.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.060]   I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the greatness,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.520]   the greatest moments of its history
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.360]   and sort of enjoy the echoes of that in the halls of MIT.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.880]   In the same way in Boston, you think about the history
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.400]   and that history lives on in the few individuals.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.000]   You can't just look around where Boston is now
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.880]   and be like, what has Boston become?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.480]   I think it was always carried by a minority of individuals.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.080]   I think we kind of look back in history
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.500]   and think times were greater
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.460]   in a certain kind of dimension back then,
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.900]   but that's because we remember,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.480]   this is a ridiculous non-data driven assertion of mine,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   is we remember just the brightest stars of that history
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.240]   and so we romanticize it.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.900]   But I think if you look around now,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.040]   those special people are still living in Boston
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.560]   for which Boston will be remembered as a great city
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.000]   in like 50 years.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.980]   - I think you're probably right,
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.520]   but isn't there some sort of theory about
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.640]   there's like a certain age in your life
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.680]   where things resonate differently to you?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.880]   I think they've done studies where most people
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.120]   stop searching for new music after age 19.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.440]   Most dads you see wearing super old clothes,
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.880]   that's the style of the time period
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.980]   of the last great part of their life.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.760]   So there's an evolution in people
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   and it could also be the memories of where they live.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.940]   When I was 17, of course, my neighborhood was the best then
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.560]   because I was having the most fun.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   And we always kind of look at things through that tint,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.720]   I think.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.920]   And you're right.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.140]   And I don't think there's anything wrong
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.640]   with the way cities are evolving now.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   It's just not, I prefer the time of like a mom and pop store
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.420]   not a fabricated like gastro pub that could just be like
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.360]   on a four lane super highway
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.560]   on your way out of Epcot Center.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.480]   And it's actually owned by like some conglomerate.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.080]   - But there's still the special places.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.680]   This takes us back to the road trip is maybe,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.560]   I tend to romanticize the experiences of like the diners
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.520]   in the middle of nowhere.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.900]   What would you say makes for like,
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.240]   it feels like life is made up of these experiences
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.440]   that maybe on paper seem mundane,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.520]   but are actually somehow give you a chance to pause
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.120]   and reflect on life with like a certain kind of people,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.920]   whether like really close friends or complete strangers,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.040]   maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.120]   It seems like road trip facilitates that if you allow it to.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.000]   Like, what do you think makes for those kinds of experience?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.900]   Have you had any?
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.640]   - I think in the context of a road trip,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.880]   I think it's like hyper localization.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.880]   And I think it is those experiences along the way
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:14.260]   with people and the people that you're with
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.680]   will color the experiences differently
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.880]   depending on the person.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.040]   - The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone?
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.280]   - So I've driven up and down the East Coast several times.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.760]   When I drove from LA to New York,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.360]   my friend was on the run from the cops.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   So we were trying to get out of--
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   - Traffic tickets?
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.560]   - Yeah, traffic tickets. - Allegedly.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   - Yeah, allegedly.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.000]   We were trying to get out of LA
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   because he was going to have to go away for a little while.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.200]   So we drove from LA and we just,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.140]   we were young kids, we had no idea what we were doing.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.880]   And we drove East.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.720]   And then we had an unbelievable trip,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.040]   mostly because we didn't really have a destination,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.800]   we didn't really have a timeframe, thank goodness,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.140]   'cause he got arrested again in Pennsylvania.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.120]   So we got kind of stuck there.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.960]   And then we drove back to LA when he got out in Pennsylvania
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.040]   but all the stops along the way
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.840]   were kind of like weird things.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.920]   Like you have no money, right?
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.200]   So you're finding that like a little diamond
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.840]   in the rough place to eat,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.200]   the diner you talk about, like that place.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.880]   I once was in, where was I?
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.120]   I think I was in Buenos Aires.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.960]   And the guy that I was with, he said,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   "I know this quaint little spot around the corner."
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.480]   And I was young, I was like 25.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.080]   And I thought the coolest thing in the world
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.000]   would be to be such a citizen of the world
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.840]   that you know these quaint little spots around the corner
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.280]   in like all these great cities.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.740]   Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.580]   in Argentina.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.160]   I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   I know where to get this super local like egg
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.440]   in another country.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.320]   I always thought that that was really cool.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.000]   The ability to do that anywhere in the world.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.920]   - Did you get closer with that guy when through the trip?
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.900]   I found that like, so I took a trip
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.240]   across the United States with a guy friend of mine.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.320]   We had different goals.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.040]   I was searching for meaning in life
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.580]   and he was searching for,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.720]   what's the politically correct way of phrasing it?
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.500]   But just basically trying to sleep
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.380]   with every kind of woman that this world has to offer.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.140]   - What's the difference between those two things?
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.420]   - Well, I guess he was searching
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.260]   for the different kinds of meanings.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.300]   (laughing)
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.300]   I mean, I still think that you can't find meaning
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.540]   between a woman's legs, I suppose.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.380]   That made--
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.500]   - Have you tried all of them?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.740]   (laughing)
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.180]   - But there was a tension there.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.420]   We grew closer with those experiences
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.020]   but we've gotten in fights.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.120]   There was a lot of literal almost fights
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.820]   and then we were close and there was silences
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.260]   but then we were like brothers.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.020]   It's this whole weird journey of friendship
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.940]   that we went on.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.860]   - I think anytime you spend that much time
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.740]   in a small space with another person,
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.620]   you're gonna have the different parts
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.220]   of the relationship will manifest themselves.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.860]   You'll have the periods of closeness.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.360]   You'll have the periods of vulnerability
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.740]   where it's like maybe you're driving through Denver
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.700]   and it's three in the morning
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.740]   and you talk about something
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.640]   you might not have otherwise talked about.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.260]   You'll have the periods where you don't wanna see
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.820]   that motherfucker ever again.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.540]   And depending, could be because of anything.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.500]   But the guy that I drove twice with,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.660]   we're still in contact, we're still buddies.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.060]   We have very different goals also
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.100]   but at that point in our lives,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.820]   we never even contemplated the meaning of life.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.660]   We were about probably more to the point
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.980]   of the friend that you drove with,
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.140]   we were more about racking up experiences,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.080]   whatever they were.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.880]   I wanna be able to retell this.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.600]   - Stories.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.120]   - Yeah, I wanna be able to retell this
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.480]   and it's gotta sound cool.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.080]   I don't wanna retell a story about,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.480]   yeah, and then we drove through Alabama
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.800]   and they've got a lovely library
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.000]   and I checked out this book
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.680]   and I'm not interested in retelling that.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.240]   - Do you remember any, well, this is a kid's show.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.160]   Do you remember any stories that the kids would enjoy
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.220]   from those times that were profound in some kind of way?
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.460]   - There were some impactful moments
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.220]   on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.340]   and as a couple of kids who knew nothing,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.580]   we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.460]   and we went to Circus Circus.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.300]   At the time, they had $3 blackjack
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.740]   and we had like 12 bucks
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.540]   and my buddy was a kind of a degenerate gambler
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.460]   so he knew what was up.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.460]   I was just like kind of stuffing chips in my pockets,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.180]   making sure we could pay for the gas.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.300]   And just being at the point which is like a starting line
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.220]   and like we drove from LA to Vegas
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.040]   which is only about four hours
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.200]   and being at the starting line
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.540]   and realizing like we may not even like
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.180]   get off the starting line here.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.780]   And if we don't, what are we doing?
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.900]   We're gonna be two guys stuck in Vegas with no money.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.020]   We can't go West 'cause you're gonna get pinched.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.260]   We have no money to go East.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.100]   What the hell are we gonna do?
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.540]   We're gonna wind up in Vegas?
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.600]   So that was kind of a profound thing where you just,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.680]   it's a turning, it potentially could have been
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.300]   a turning point in our lives
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.580]   had we not made enough money to continue going East.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.700]   - That's the beautiful thing about road trips
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.020]   when you're broke is like in retrospect,
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.940]   everything turned out fine
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.860]   but you're facing the complete darkness,
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.740]   the uncertainty of the possibilities laid before you.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.180]   And like, I don't know if you were confident at that time
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.940]   but like I was really full of self-doubt.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.260]   Like just all I could see is all the trajectories
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.540]   where you just screw up your life.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.820]   Like what am I doing with my life?
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.300]   I'm a failure, like all these dreams I've had,
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.660]   I've never realized I'm a complete piece of shit,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.500]   all those kinds of things.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.760]   - I had no concept of consequence.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.100]   I probably had toxoplasmosis.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.100]   I had literally no concept of consequence.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.340]   Immediate gratification was all I cared about.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.900]   - Oh, so existentialist.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   - Yeah, it did not even enter my mind in my early 20s
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.460]   that anything that I was doing at that point
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.700]   could reverberate for the rest of my life.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.380]   I think part of me didn't even think I'd make it this far.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.540]   And so I was not interested in like the long play.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.380]   I remember thinking like,
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.900]   why should I be acting now in a way
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.060]   that might impact a point in my life I never reach?
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.060]   - And yet now you are a man
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.780]   who searches for meaning in life, at least.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.660]   I would say to put another way,
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.300]   you think deeply about this world
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.500]   and in a philosophical context
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.500]   while also appreciating the violence
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.420]   of hurting other friends of yours, right?
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   On a regular basis.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.980]   So why do you think, I mean,
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.700]   maybe there's a broader question there,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.500]   but also a personal question.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   It seems that people who fight for prolonged periods of time
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.080]   like jiu-jitsu people and mixed martial arts people,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   even military folks, become over time philosophers.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.260]   What is that?
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.180]   Is there a parallel between fighting and violence
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.140]   and the philosophical depth with which you now have arrived
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.740]   from the starting point of being the full existentialist
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.780]   of like just living in the moment
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.780]   to like being introspective human now?
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.980]   - I would say to that,
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.980]   being a soldier or a warrior hundreds of years ago
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.820]   is probably what started the marriage
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.140]   between martial arts and philosophy.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.060]   If you're constantly under someone else's charge
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   and you're told to go out and walk in a line
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.820]   and overtake some Germanic tribe somewhere,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.740]   and that happens all the time,
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.700]   your job is being a soldier.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.580]   On any given day, you might not come home.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.280]   So I think that you have to start your day
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.300]   by thinking deeply about how you've lived to that point
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.540]   and the people that are living in and around you.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.820]   And how you've treated them.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.180]   And I think that probably is what started the marriage
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.220]   of being kind of like a philosophical martial artist.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.120]   You've got to really like on a daily basis,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.980]   take stock of what's going on around you and inside you.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.900]   Because we all suffer with this kind of idea.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.460]   If today's my last day, did I do it right?
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.180]   And we don't really do it so much nowadays
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.900]   because we're so comfortable.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.340]   But if we were being marched out to war every day,
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.100]   I think you'd see people live a little bit differently.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.060]   And you treat the people around you
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.100]   a little bit differently.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.780]   - Do you think there's echoes of that
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.340]   in just even the sport of like grappling and jiu-jitsu
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.220]   where you're facing your own mortality?
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.660]   We don't really think of it that way, but.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.580]   - To be honest, I think that a lot of people
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.540]   that train in a martial art in contemporary society,
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.060]   I don't consider them all martial artists.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.980]   I think just because you train in martial art
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.460]   does not mean you're a martial artist.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.900]   There are so many people that use martial arts
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.700]   as a form of exercise.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.180]   And like this little piece of self-concept,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.820]   they use martial arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.640]   And it's really a form of exercise.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.340]   It's something they do, it's not something they are.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.700]   And I think there's a big difference there.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.540]   - There's a bunch of stuff mixed up in there
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.840]   because the Instagram thing is something you do for,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.800]   it's also, it could be something you are for display
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.020]   versus who you are in the private moments
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.540]   of searching and thinking and struggling
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.420]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.700]   Instagram is a surface layer
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.980]   that much of modern society operates in,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.220]   which is really problematic.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.100]   'Cause there's that gap between the person
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.420]   you show to the world and the person you are
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.460]   in private life.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.660]   And if you make majority of your project,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.060]   of the human project of your sort of few years
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.520]   on this earth, the optimization
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.160]   of the public Instagram profile,
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.980]   then you never develop this private person.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.240]   But it does seem that if you do Jiu-Jitsu long enough,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.680]   it's very difficult not to fall into like,
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.920]   this has become a personal journey,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.400]   an intellectual journey.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.360]   Because like, if you get your ass kicked thousands of times,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.180]   there's a certain point to where that,
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.400]   maybe it's like a defense mechanism,
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.080]   but that turns into some kind of deeply profound
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.720]   introspective experience versus like exercise.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.960]   - That's true. - Not yoga.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.000]   - Yeah, so let me go back first
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.360]   and address the Instagram point,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.880]   which I think there's a difference between people
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.640]   whose Instagram is intrinsically tied to their profession
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.880]   and they have to put a specific profile out there.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.500]   And I think in general,
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.580]   people who truthfully, their business is tied
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.440]   to their Instagram profile, I wanna exclude them.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.400]   I think that most people,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.160]   Instagram is how they want to be seen.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.400]   And that's not always congruent with who you are,
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   but I think there is a level of dishonesty there.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.480]   Like, this is how I want people to see me.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.320]   I'm gonna put all this stuff in my Instagram bio,
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.040]   but that's really not me.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.740]   And when you do that,
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.680]   I think it's a little disingenuous and you're right.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.800]   There's not, you're never really gonna marry
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.880]   those two things together and it gets tough.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.360]   - Let me, sorry to interrupt,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.760]   let me push back on something.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.120]   This is a good time to address the many flaws
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.640]   of the great and powerful John Clark.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.400]   Okay, let's go there 'cause it's interesting.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.880]   You strive so hard for excellence in your life
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.740]   and for extreme competence that you are visibly
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.140]   and physically off-put by people
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.340]   who have not achieved competence.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:51.980]   Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.340]   those early, like you mentioned,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.540]   a person who first picks up an art,
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.340]   picks up, becomes vegan, starts doing CrossFit,
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.420]   started doing Jiu-Jitsu for the first time
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.700]   and create that as their,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.900]   you know, they're struggling through this,
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.160]   like, who am I?
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.420]   And they're really overly proud
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.020]   and it's kind of ridiculous.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.220]   And you in your wise chair have seen many battles.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.060]   - I'm old.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.820]   - Yeah, that you see the ridiculousness of that.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.820]   I tend to, I'm learning to give those folks,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.540]   not to mock them and to sort of give them a chance
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.420]   to do their ridiculousness because I think I was that too.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.220]   - Let me first clarify.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.300]   I wanna be clear about what you mean
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.340]   when you say a level of competence.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.300]   Now, I've never won a world championship.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   I've never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.180]   where I've not achieved what most people would consider
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.060]   to be the penultimate level of success.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:54.900]   Now--
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.140]   - That's accomplishments.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.420]   - It's accomplishments, it's ribbons, it's things like that.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.500]   And it's not that those things don't mean anything to me.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.180]   And the fact that I haven't in some arenas
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.620]   is something that I wanna change,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.260]   which is we can talk about that in a second.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.620]   But I think that there's a difference
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:16.620]   between the very eager noob of whatever it is they're doing
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.140]   who does the thing so that they can signal they do the thing.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.780]   That's a person I have less respect for.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.860]   So we know each other primarily through jujitsu.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.340]   Look at a jujitsu tournament.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.260]   There's this idea that people espouse online.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.660]   I respect anyone with the guts to get on the mat
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.260]   and put it on the line and sign up for a tournament.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.500]   That is the biggest load of shit I have ever heard.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.340]   - This is great.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.780]   - Do you know how easy it is for you to put your name
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.340]   on something and pay the registration fee and walk in there?
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.540]   That's not the hard part.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.420]   That's the easiest part.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.940]   I don't care if you lose your first match,
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.420]   but I respect the person who signs up for the tournament,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.060]   registers for the tournament, goes on a diet,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.740]   loses weight the right way, trains their ass off,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   and does the things properly, and then goes on the mat.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.940]   The person who simply signs their name
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.100]   on the registration form and jumps on the mat,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.600]   if they haven't done these other things,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   they actually have nothing to lose.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.920]   Because what they've done is they've stepped onto the mat,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.780]   in the ring, in the cage, with a bucket full of excuses.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.700]   Sure, you signed up, but you're not really vulnerable
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.820]   because you didn't run, you didn't do this,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.660]   you didn't do all the things you were supposed to do.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.380]   The person who eliminates every possible excuse
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.060]   and then steps on the mat and gets their ass kicked
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.700]   in the first round, I have so much more respect
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.220]   for that person than the person who does nothing
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.820]   and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.300]   and then writes on Facebook on how I lost
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.060]   to the eventual champion.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.380]   That's worth zero, that's worth zero.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.920]   And in that process, what did you learn about yourself?
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.020]   You learned about yourself that you've got
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.140]   a natural level of aptitude for whatever this activity is
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.660]   that you're doing, but you didn't actually learn
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.220]   how to maximize it through training and through dedication
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.500]   and through all these other things.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   I'm an incredibly interested, novice musician.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   I like to play bass, but I don't put that on anything.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.340]   And I stink at it.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.180]   I would really love to be sick at it.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.760]   I'm currently not, but I'm not running around,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.260]   talking about entering, any of those other things.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.840]   Like I do it, it's for myself and I wanna reach a level
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.260]   of competence in that.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.660]   - So the person that you have respect for
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.420]   is a person who takes it fully seriously,
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.380]   takes the effort fully seriously.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.580]   So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.940]   that you're going to perform live
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.700]   and just in your own private moments,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.000]   your private thoughts, you're not going to give yourself
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.100]   an excuse out like, I'm just gonna have fun.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.380]   It's just a nice experience.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.340]   You're going to think, I'm going to try to be
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.020]   the best possible bass player,
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.740]   given everything that's going on in my life,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   but I'm going to do my, like,
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.900]   and put it all on the line.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.620]   And if I fail, that's not because I didn't try.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.300]   It's because I'm a failure.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.140]   - Exactly.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.860]   - And then sit in that sick feeling of like, I'm a failure.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.420]   - But isn't that an important thing to know?
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.520]   - No, absolutely.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.680]   But there's a,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.300]   that's like the best thing we could be,
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.580]   but sometimes it's fun to lose yourself
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.580]   in the bragging, in the lesser ways of life.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.600]   And I think I'm careful not to,
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.820]   because too many people in my life,
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.900]   when I brought them with like a little candle
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.620]   of a fire of a dream, they would just go like,
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.900]   you know, they would just blow that fire out,
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.940]   that they would dismiss me 'cause they see like,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.980]   you know, I would say,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.820]   I've said a lot of ridiculous stuff,
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.020]   but the one, you know, I've always dreamed about
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.860]   like putting,
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.740]   I always dreamed of having this world full of robots.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.300]   And, you know, every time I would bring these ideas up,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.980]   they'll be shut down by the different people,
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.860]   by my parents, by, you know,
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.060]   then you need to first get an education,
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.860]   you need to succeed in these dimensions.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.100]   In order to do all these things,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.780]   you have to get good grades, you have to,
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.700]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.220]   Like there's all this stuff that it's indirect
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.740]   or direct ways of blowing out that little ridiculous dream
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.220]   that you present.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.960]   And it's like, you know, I remember sort of bringing up,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.100]   I don't know,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.340]   things like becoming a state champion in wrestling, right?
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.180]   - Yeah.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.100]   It's a weird dance because of course the coaches will tell,
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.180]   they'll kind of dismiss that.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.740]   It's like, okay, okay.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.660]   But at the same time, it feels like in those early days,
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.420]   you have to preserve that little fire.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.460]   That's like Johnny Ive, I don't know if you know who that is,
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.860]   is a designer at Apple.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.780]   He was a chief designer.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.620]   He's behind most iPhone, all that stuff.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.020]   And he always talked about that he wouldn't bring his ideas
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.300]   to Steve Jobs until they were matured
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.500]   because he would always shit on them.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.780]   He wanted them to like as little babies,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.060]   like live for a little bit
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.940]   before they get completely shut down.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.860]   And I always think about that when I see a beginner
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.220]   sort of bragging on Instagram, you have to be careful.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.980]   Let them play with that little dream, you know?
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.420]   - Are you playing with a little dream that you're nurturing
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.980]   and you're trying to take that little flame
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.300]   and you're trying to create a roaring blaze with it?
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.700]   Or are you playing with the idea of it
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.140]   and behind that there's no substance?
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.220]   - Well, it's hard to know the difference.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   That's what I struggle with.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.060]   - Is it?
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.060]   I don't think it necessarily is.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.180]   Certainly you're wrong.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.460]   And when I say Instagram,
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.900]   I don't wanna impugn a bunch of strangers,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.580]   but I have a gym with a lot of members.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.700]   And I can tell you that the number of years
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.740]   I've been in the gym,
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.060]   when someone comes to me and says, "This is my goal,"
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.240]   I don't tell them yes or no in general, but I know.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.340]   I can tell by the way they say it to me,
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.700]   I can thin slice it.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.620]   I've seen the look on people's faces
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.420]   and when people start to say they wanna do X, Y, and Z,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.180]   I know right off the bat,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.740]   this person's either gonna put an effort in
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.620]   or they're not going to put an effort in.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.660]   So to me, it's about the effort behind that.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.900]   If you're busting your ass
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.260]   and you're a new at something and you're brand new,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.540]   but you're working really hard
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.740]   and you have a series of moderate successes in that,
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.340]   that's the guy I wanna champion
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.320]   because that persistence and that grit over time,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.780]   those successes will no longer be moderate.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.060]   They'll be huge.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.780]   But the person who's having moderate success
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.860]   by doing nothing, chances are,
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.540]   they'll never learn to put that work in
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.940]   and the successes will never grow.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.580]   - You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.420]   - I love him.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.200]   - I was just gonna let that sit for a brief moment.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.260]   Why?
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.680]   - I think there's a combination of factors.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.380]   One is the timeliness of his career
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.580]   and the age I was when he came to prominence.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.020]   The raw, brutal violence
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.560]   and the raw, brutal honesty when he speaks.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.740]   I think it's easy for people to hear him or see his life
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.140]   and cast him aside as some Simeon-esque,
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.180]   like just Cretan scourge on society.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.660]   But when you hear him speak,
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.200]   like this is not a guy who's unintelligent.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.300]   This is a guy who knows himself better
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.660]   than probably most of us know ourselves.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.180]   It's disarming.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:51.180]   And that's a humongous part of my admiration for him.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.060]   - Who is Mike Tyson?
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   Because it feels like there's similarity between him and you.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.940]   It feels like there's a violent person in there,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.820]   but also a really kind person.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.860]   And they're all living together in a little house
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.820]   and you're the same.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.460]   There's a thoughtful person,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.660]   but there's also a scary, violent person.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.620]   And they're having a picnic.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.120]   - They're having a picnic.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.820]   I think there are dialectical tensions in everyone.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.220]   These like opposing forces
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.940]   that are constantly pulling at you.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.620]   And at different points in your life,
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.420]   like it's sliding scale.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.420]   And I think that certainly when I was a younger person,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:35.140]   there was a lot more manifestation of the violence
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.380]   and a lot less of the kindness.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.560]   People who were not as close to me
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.300]   probably saw more of the violent side
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.720]   and only the very close people to me saw like
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.660]   what would pass for the kind side.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.180]   And now that's sliding in the other direction.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.220]   And I worry actually sometimes that
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.180]   there could be a situation where I need
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.300]   that old version of me
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   and he's getting further and further away
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.860]   and I can't call him up if I need him.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.660]   And that concerns me to a certain degree.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:12.180]   - The sad aging warrior seeing his greater self fade away.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.820]   But you still compete.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.200]   Does that person return?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.440]   It seems like for Mike Tyson,
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.040]   that person returned at the prospect of competition.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.400]   - It returns, but I've learned better
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.040]   how to manifest it in competition
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.780]   in terms of like the effects that that type of emotion
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.240]   has on you physically in the middle of a competition.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.440]   So I've better learned how to utilize that energy.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.320]   But I think another side effect of this is like
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.480]   having a gym where you're a bigger guy
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.960]   and you're the head instructor,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.900]   you can't be as mean and violent as you once were
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.420]   because you're also now trying to run a business.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.000]   And you spend so long, so many years
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.600]   trying not to be mean and to soften
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.560]   your technique a little bit,
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.680]   that that all of a sudden just becomes who you are.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.520]   And I don't necessarily like that.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.820]   So I've been trying to reclaim that a little bit on the mat.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.580]   But I think in competition,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   there has to be, an athlete really wants to score the points.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.560]   A fighter really wants to incapacitate you
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.600]   and put you in a position where they can do their own bidding
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   and the result in a jujitsu match
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.580]   might just still be two points,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.360]   but the motivations are very, very different.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.520]   - What do you make of Tyson on Joe Rogan
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.600]   saying that he was aroused by violence?
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.160]   Do you think that's insane?
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.760]   Do you think that's deeply honest for him?
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.320]   And do you think that rings true for many of us,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.640]   others who practices in different degrees?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.840]   - I can't speak for a lot of people.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.880]   And I think that it was a brutally honest statement by him.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.200]   And I think it's something that
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.440]   even if a lot of people feel it,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.600]   they're not that comfortable admitting it or saying it.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   But I think there's great joy
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.800]   in landing a flush right hand on someone's jaw
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.320]   and then watching them crumble.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.480]   You don't even feel it.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.240]   You ever play baseball as a kid?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.960]   You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.360]   and it will sting your hands
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.120]   because of the way that you hit it.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.320]   You can hit a home run and you won't feel anything
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.840]   and it'll just feel so good in your hands.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   And that's, I think, one of the joys of physical contact.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.040]   When you do it the right way,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.160]   and that goes for all physical contact,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.960]   when you do it the right way,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.600]   the physical pleasure you can derive from it
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.360]   and the mental pleasure, it's unparalleled.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.440]   - But that's different.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.000]   Let me draw a distinction.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.600]   I've had the fortune of being a wrestler.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.380]   And I would draw a distinction between
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.680]   a very well executed in competition
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.000]   double leg, single leg takedown or a pin.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.620]   There's some, as an OCD person,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.560]   there's something so comforting about a well executed pin
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.080]   because it's like two seconds
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.640]   and it's just like everything is flush and nice
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.400]   and it's all clean.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.480]   I mean, okay, as this OCD person who likes to align,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.380]   show it's just beautiful.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.140]   Okay, that's good technique.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.460]   Wrestling also provides you,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.600]   maybe more than other sports,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.720]   the feeling of dominating another human.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.560]   - Yes.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.760]   - Of breaking, no, not just of them being very cocky
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.280]   and very powerful, you feel this power of another human
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.460]   being and then you breaking them.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.460]   And like, I'm not as honest as Mike Tyson.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.720]   But that's, I don't think I've ever sort of looked
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.040]   in the mirror and said that that was,
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.100]   I enjoyed that aspect of it.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.400]   But it certainly seems like you chase that.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.500]   - So when I was a wrestler in high school,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.100]   I lost so many matches because of over aggressiveness.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.400]   Like, I would pick the top position and let you stand
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.160]   just so that I could do a mat return.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.200]   And I wasn't trying to return you to the mat.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.380]   I was actually trying to like drive you through the mat
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.480]   and through the ground.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.640]   It gave me joy to do that.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.920]   Like, it wasn't like I was trying to just return you
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.640]   to the mat so that I could pin you.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.920]   That what you just talked about,
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.900]   like the dominating another person,
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.520]   I used to look at that as you've got someone who in theory
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.120]   is equally trained and equally skilled as you are.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.500]   And you're absolutely out there totally dominating them.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.920]   There's joy in that.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.040]   You could get in an MMA fight and you could take someone
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.960]   down and you can mount them.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.160]   And all that feels great.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.960]   But when you start raining down the punches on their face
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.000]   from mount and like dropping elbows and stuff,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.080]   like there's another level of satisfaction there.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.460]   And it's tough to describe.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.320]   And I don't think that everyone is made for it.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.940]   When I was a, I think when I was a senior in high school,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.480]   my wrestling coach said, look, you've got to stop
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.160]   with all this crazy aggressive wrestling.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.080]   Like they tried to turn me into a technician
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.240]   and it did work to a degree.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.800]   And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.420]   But it wasn't the same level of enjoyment out of it.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.920]   Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.100]   'cause my coach said cross face and I cross face
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.060]   and he said harder.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.420]   And I basically wound up and blasted a kid in the face
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.780]   and his nose got busted everywhere.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.380]   But I didn't think not to do it because that felt good.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.540]   It felt good to cross face him like that.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.340]   I was a lot of like.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.540]   - That's a weird American warrior ethos that I've picked up.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.900]   But I also have, I mean, the Russian, the Sitya brothers
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.700]   that don't see it as that.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.300]   They don't get draw.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.520]   They think that there is a tension between the art
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.480]   of the martial art and the violence of the martial art.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.320]   - I agree with that.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.880]   - It's a poetic way I could put it,
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.240]   but they're not so fascinated with this Dan Gable
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.080]   dominating another human.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   They think of the effortlessness of the technique
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.640]   and your mastery of the art is exhibited
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.400]   in its effortlessness.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.100]   How much you lose yourself in the moment and the timing
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.260]   that just the beauty of a timing.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.540]   Like there's much more, like one example in Judo,
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.980]   but also in wrestling, you can look at the foot sweep.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.340]   Wrestlers in America and even Judo players in America
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.900]   and much of the world don't admire the beauty
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.400]   of the foot sweep.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.100]   But a well-timed foot sweep, which is a way to sort of
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.760]   off balance to find the right timing to just effortlessly
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.040]   change the tape, turn the tables of,
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.520]   dominate your opponent is seen as the highest form
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.280]   of mastery in Russian wrestling and in the case of Judo,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.320]   it's in Japanese Judo.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.200]   It's interesting.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.620]   I'm not sure what that tension is about.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.060]   I think it actually takes me back to,
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.720]   I don't know if you listen to Dan Carlin,
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.800]   Hardcore History and Genghis Khan, if you've ever--
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.680]   - I read a great, great book.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.660]   - On Genghis Khan? - Yeah.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.220]   - I'm still trying to adjust.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.420]   Most of my life said Genghis Khan,
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.500]   but the right pronunciation is actually Changus Khan.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.920]   There's a tension there.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.900]   We kind of think, I don't know, we, I kind of thought
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.280]   as Genghis Khan is a ultra violent,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.940]   a leader of ultra violent men, but another view,
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.640]   another way to see them is the people who,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   warriors that valued extreme competence
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.320]   and mastery of the art of fighting with weapons,
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.520]   with bows, with horse riding, all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.440]   And I'm not sure exactly where to place them
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   on my sort of thinking about violence in our human history.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.820]   I think in the context of like combat sports,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.020]   I think there's a difference between an athlete
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.220]   winning a contest under a certain set of rules
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.260]   and a fighter winning a fight under those exact same rules.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.340]   There's a different approach to it.
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.980]   And I don't think one is any better than the other.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.360]   Like in MMA, I think a great example would be
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.960]   George St. Pierre.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.700]   George St. Pierre is a tremendous,
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.500]   it's a tremendous athlete and he considers himself
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.420]   to be a martial artist first.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.940]   He's trying to win an athletic competition.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.500]   Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass, right?
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.300]   There's a different approach to it.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.140]   And yes, they've had different results
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.320]   at the highest level of competition,
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.960]   but it's difficult to attribute the difference in results
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.460]   just to their approach to the sport
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.620]   because they're different human beings
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.460]   with different abilities
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.020]   and different physical attributes.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.580]   The Saitia brothers have that luxury of being able
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:14.300]   to talk about the beauty of a perfectly timed slide by.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.140]   There are other wrestlers
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.980]   that will never be able to pull that off
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.860]   and therefore they have to pursue other ways
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.940]   to defeat someone.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.740]   And maybe it is the Dan Gable,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.340]   breaking a man's spirit by outworking him type thing,
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.440]   which is beautiful in its own way.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.860]   But we tend to self-select the ways
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.940]   in which we're able to be successful
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.420]   and then kind of take a deep dive into that.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.700]   - What do you think is more beautiful,
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.700]   brute force or effortless execution
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.540]   of a technique that dominates another human?
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.140]   - I think it's a subjective thing
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.340]   based on what skills you perceive yourself to have.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.700]   I've never been a slick, super athletic,
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.380]   dexterous competitor in anything.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.300]   And I've always been more of an,
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.060]   I've got to outwork you, I've got to outgrind you,
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.380]   I got to out mean you.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.500]   And so because I've lived that,
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.520]   I tend to see the beauty in that more
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.700]   because I have a perceptual awareness
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.520]   that I don't have for the people
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.120]   who have the luxury of being very slick and athletic
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.740]   and using beautiful technique.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.780]   Now that said, there was a phenomenal little video
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.420]   the other day I sent to a friend
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   of a compilation of foot sweeps by Liotta Machida in MMA.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.780]   And they're so beautiful and they're so awesome.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.020]   And it's not that I don't have an appreciation for those,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.220]   but I can't emulate those
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.540]   because I lack the physical ability to do that.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.300]   Whereas I at least have a chance to emulate
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.780]   some of the people who do it through grit
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.060]   and through outworking people.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.420]   - But I would love to return to Genghis Khan
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.660]   and get your thoughts about,
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.420]   like I have so many mixed feelings
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.420]   about whether he is evil or not.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:09.980]   Whether the violence that he brought to the world
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.300]   had ultimately, the fact that it had maybe
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.340]   kind of like Dan Carlin describes,
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.780]   cleansed the landscape.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.660]   It's like a reset for the world through violence
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.660]   had ultimately a progressive effect on human civilization
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:34.200]   even though in the short term it led to massive,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.620]   you could say suffering.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.860]   I don't know what to make of that man.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.100]   What are your thoughts on Genghis Khan?
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.020]   - I think it's always difficult to look at a historical
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.900]   figure and their actions of their time
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.580]   through a modern day lens.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   Because it's easy for us to kind of impugn their achievements
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.740]   and the things that they did and say,
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.060]   oh, well, what he did was wrong.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.180]   Well, of course that can be true.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.780]   But a lot of times we don't actually have any real good
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.920]   context or concept of the times they were living in
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.300]   and what really was deemed wrong and what really wasn't.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.540]   We're looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.940]   That being said, from what I've read about Genghis Khan,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   yeah, he was a violent dude, but also he gave you an option.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.220]   When he got to a village, he said, look,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.660]   you have a choice.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.100]   You can come with us or you can run.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.900]   And he gave them an option to join his legion of fighters
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.500]   who he took very good care of.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   He was the first military leader to pay his soldiers'
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.020]   families when they died.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.140]   And he did that based on the booty that they got
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.260]   when they raided a village.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.940]   He took that money, he took his share,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.540]   and they divided that up amongst the soldiers
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.980]   and then the soldiers' families.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.980]   I think he also is credited with first horseback mail
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.620]   routes or something like that, right?
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.580]   Isn't he the godfather of the modern postal system?
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.980]   Or something like that.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   - Yeah, he's the Bernie Sanders of the Mongol Empire.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:18.860]   I do think the offering of surrender is an interesting one
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.860]   'cause it's interesting as a thought experiment
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.660]   whether you would sacrifice your way of,
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.260]   like the pride of nations or the nationalism,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.500]   pride of your country, whether you're willing
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.860]   to give that up to survive.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:41.180]   - It depends on who depends on you.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:45.100]   If you have a family and young kids and stuff like that,
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.220]   I think your obligation is primarily to them.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.140]   And therefore, surrender has to be something
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.980]   that you consider in that moment in time
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.500]   so that you can take care of those people.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.720]   If you're a man alone and you've got all these principles
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.260]   and all this other stuff and you're not down
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.660]   with what Genghis Khan is doing and what he's selling,
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.340]   yeah, try and escape, do your thing,
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.700]   and just know what waits on the other side
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.100]   of that for you potentially.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.980]   But I think if there's someone else out there
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.140]   that depends on you, your obligation should be to them.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.620]   - It feels like historically,
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.160]   people valued principles more than life.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.820]   In this weight of what do I value more,
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.540]   the principles I hold versus survival,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:30.300]   it seems that now we don't value principles as much.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.760]   Principles could be also religion,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.720]   it could be your values, whatever.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.020]   We're okay sort of sacrificing those
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.660]   to preserve our survival.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.020]   And that applies in all forms, like actual survival,
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.920]   or on social media, like preserving your reputation,
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.480]   all those kinds of things.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.700]   It seems like we, especially in America,
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.260]   value individual life,
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.580]   that death is somehow a really bad thing,
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.140]   as opposed to saying sacrificing your principles
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.820]   is a very bad thing and everybody dies,
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.860]   and it's okay to die.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.160]   What's horrible is to sacrifice your principles
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.920]   of who you are just to live another day.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.620]   - I think a big problem is people don't really
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.820]   even know what their principles are anymore.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.100]   Social media and just the way that we live nowadays,
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:29.460]   where we're separated from the human contact like this.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:33.580]   You're not contacting people in a community anymore.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.260]   Whether you're religious or not,
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.820]   you're not congregating at a church.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.180]   You're not part of a parish like you would be down South.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.100]   You're not part of that community anymore.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.460]   And so it's difficult to figure out
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.380]   what your principles and values are,
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.580]   because you're constantly jumping from one bucket
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.380]   to the next online.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.180]   And you don't get a lot of direct,
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.180]   like reasonable feedback from people.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.660]   You just get dipshit feedback,
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.860]   like, "Oh, you don't believe this?
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.980]   "Well, you're a jerk."
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.700]   - I think the hard thing currently
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.420]   is having the integrity and character
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.420]   to stick by your principles one another.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:15.740]   I don't wanna equate murder in the Genghis Khan times
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.040]   to social media cancel culture,
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.780]   but it certainly doesn't feel good
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.820]   when people are attacking on social media.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.680]   And it does take a lot of integrity to,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.060]   without anger, without emotion,
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:34.700]   without mocking others or attacking others unfairly,
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.940]   standing by the ideas you hold,
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.920]   or in another way,
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.180]   standing by your friends,
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.180]   standing by this little group,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.740]   like loyalty of the people that you know are good people.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.180]   I find that in cancel culture,
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.080]   one of the sad things is whenever somebody gets,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.220]   quote unquote, "canceled,"
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.640]   everybody just gets, all their friends become really quiet
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.100]   and don't defend them.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.920]   Or worse, I mean, quiet is at least understandable.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.640]   They kind of signal that,
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.940]   they throw 'em out of the bus, I guess,
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.900]   is one way to put it.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.340]   And that's something I think about a lot,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.520]   because coming from me, it's like,
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.480]   I hold an ethic, I don't know if others hold this ethic,
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.280]   maybe it's this Russian mobster ethic of,
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.440]   you should help your friends bury the body.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.020]   You shouldn't criticize your friends
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.560]   for committing the murder.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.220]   Like there are certain levels of,
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.880]   yeah, you have that discussion after you bury the body,
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.360]   that maybe you shouldn't have done that murder thing.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.860]   I don't know, I understand that that's a problematic,
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.320]   what's the terminology?
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.120]   That's a problematic ethical framework
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.400]   within which to operate, but at the same time,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.480]   it feels like what else do we have in this world
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.240]   except the brotherhood, the sisterhood,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.600]   the love we have for a very small community?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.200]   But perhaps that's the wrong way of thinking.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.240]   Perhaps the 21st century would be defined
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.200]   by the dissipation of this community,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.880]   of this loyalty concept.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.560]   - No. - We're all just individuals.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.560]   - I think you're right, and I think you have to have
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.640]   some sort of core framework of principles and beliefs
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.840]   that you operate on.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.280]   And I think what I was referencing
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.960]   is a little bit different, but to speak to your point,
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   you need a framework of core principles
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.440]   on which you can then base a lot of your other decisions.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.520]   Like I believe these three things to be true,
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.720]   whatever they are, and that will help inform
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.640]   other decisions you make in your life.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.000]   As far as how you treat your friends,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.600]   I've got probably three friends that,
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.840]   if they called me right now and said,
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.520]   "Let's bury the body," sorry, Lex, I gotta go.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.640]   There are other people in my life that if they said,
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.440]   "Hey, we've gotta go bury the body,"
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.880]   I would say, "Who is this?"
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.720]   (Lex laughs)
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.760]   You know? - Yeah.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.040]   - So I think it depends on the relationship.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.200]   - That's a really good measure.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.000]   I would love that to be in your profile.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.640]   People put pronouns.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:22.240]   I would love to put honestly, objectively,
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.840]   not self-report, but objective,
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.400]   how many people in your life, if they committed murder,
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.860]   you would not ask any questions
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.120]   and you would help them hide the body.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.980]   I would love to know that number for people.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.920]   - Yeah, and I think it's a weird thing too
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.200]   because you think right away,
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.920]   okay, it must be the group of people
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.960]   that are the closest to you.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.900]   That's who you're first thinking of, right?
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.160]   But obviously for my best friend,
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.840]   I would do it, no question about it.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.680]   But I've got other people that are close to me
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.640]   that are close to me in other ways,
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.920]   and I probably wouldn't do that
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.260]   only because I don't think they'd do it for me.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.100]   - Yeah.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.680]   - And that is a consideration.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.920]   So I guess is the principle there
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.060]   then that you do for your friends
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.440]   what you think they would do for you?
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.280]   Is that the underlying principle?
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.920]   Or do you just have a blind loyalty
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.560]   to people in your life for different reasons?
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.720]   I got people that are not on my inner circle
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.800]   that I probably wouldn't help change a tire
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.380]   to in the morning if they were on the highway,
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.280]   but if they called me and said,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.720]   "Hey, we gotta bury the body,"
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   I might show up for that.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.480]   It's just these weird different connections you have.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.400]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.840]   Yeah, I have close friends that I'd probably be,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.440]   exactly, the tire's a good example.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.440]   I'd be like, "Can't you find somebody else to do this?"
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.480]   - Right.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   - I think part of that is just this leap of faith,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   like giving yourself to the other person
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.880]   that creates a deep connection
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.880]   that makes life fulfilling, meaningful,
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.640]   that doesn't exist if you don't take that leap.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.840]   I mean, it's not about the murder.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.920]   We're sort of focusing.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.840]   I think you have to, what is it,
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.040]   cross that bridge when you get there.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.080]   I'm not exactly sure.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.840]   Is this just a thought experiment?
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.160]   But I think about that a lot,
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.720]   especially these COVID times
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.400]   and as people become more and more isolated
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.280]   and separated from each other.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.800]   How important is it to have those deep connections
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.400]   to other humans?
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.520]   - I think especially what you're talking about there.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.200]   Have you ever seen the movie "The Town"?
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.500]   There's a great line in the movie
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.440]   where one of the main characters
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.340]   walks into his friend's house and he says,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.400]   "I need your help.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.780]   "We're gonna go hurt some people
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.920]   "and you can never ask me about it again."
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.280]   And the friend looks up and he says,
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.640]   "Whose car are we taking?"
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.200]   Like that is the type of person you need in your life.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.160]   And the people, like there are people
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.000]   that will walk through that door and say that to you
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.360]   and you drop everything you're doing.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.680]   And then there's the people that walk through your door
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.600]   and you're like, "You know what?
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.400]   "I got a Hot Pocket in the microwave.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.800]   "I'm a little bit tied up right now,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.520]   "but I'd love to help you out, but I don't wanna do that."
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.240]   And you don't have that deep connection with those people.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.000]   - You mentioned some principles
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.320]   that you've changed your mind on.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.760]   Do you wanna go there?
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.640]   Is there some interesting principles
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.960]   and the process of changing that is useful to talk about?
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.440]   - I can't really cite a specific thing
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.720]   except that understanding that the principles
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.440]   that you have at different points in your life can change
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.640]   and it's okay to change them without being a total pussy
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.160]   and being bullied by other people
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.280]   into thinking what you thought was wrong.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.440]   If you come to these conclusions of your own volition
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.240]   and you decide to change them, that's great.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:36.360]   And it can be really liberating.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.160]   It's really liberating to have an idea
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   that you hold so true to your core belief system
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:48.040]   and then to actually have someone change your mind for you
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.520]   and be okay with it, as opposed to being like,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.480]   "No, I gotta die with this.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.400]   "I gotta die with this."
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.240]   It's really liberating.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.080]   There are definitely ideas you wanna die on that hill
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.400]   and no one's ever gonna change your mind,
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.160]   but it's really liberating to be confident enough
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.960]   to say, "Change my mind."
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.400]   I'm lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.000]   who can tell me, "Listen, you're being a total dipshit.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   "Like, let's rethink this."
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.440]   Or like I have one friend who does the five whys all the time
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.320]   and he loves backing me into a corner.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.040]   - What's the five whys?
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.920]   - You just, like when someone makes a statement
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.080]   about something, to really get to the core issue,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   they say if you ask why five times,
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.120]   make a statement, "Well, why is that?"
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.800]   And you answer that, "Well, why?"
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.680]   And you phrase the whys differently, obviously,
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.840]   but then you get to the core.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.640]   They say five times you can get to the core of the issue
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.240]   and that's a challenging thing.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.440]   But I find later in life, it's so liberating for me
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.440]   to be confident enough to be like,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.760]   "Man, was I fucking way off the mark on this
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.120]   "and have my mind changed."
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.840]   - And be able to say that to others that I was wrong.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.680]   - Totally.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.000]   That ability, and I never used to have that,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.360]   and it feels real good.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.200]   - And there's a hunger for that, too.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.560]   - Yeah, you're so right, actually.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.240]   On a personal level, it feels very good.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.440]   Exactly as you said, it's liberating
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.920]   because you're free to then think as opposed to--
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.760]   - Defend.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.040]   - Yeah, without thinking.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.640]   - Yeah, you get so sick of defending the same thing
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.680]   over and over and over, and you start to think about it
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.480]   and it's like, "Well, I would really like
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.440]   "to evolve my thought process here."
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.080]   And when you're constantly defending one point,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.400]   it's difficult to let other ideas in.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.720]   You discount the possibility
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.960]   that you can have your mind changed
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.760]   when you're constantly on the defense.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.040]   You have to have a crack in the front line
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   in order to let a new idea come in and possibly flourish.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.320]   And maybe the new idea doesn't even prove
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.360]   your current belief system to be wrong,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.160]   but maybe it's like the water to a seed,
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.200]   and it grows, and now it's something even bigger and better.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.080]   And you can start to work with that instead.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.800]   And it's a tough thing 'cause I'm a stubborn fuck,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.160]   and it's very difficult for me, it was historically,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.080]   to say, "I was wrong about this one,"
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.440]   or, "I messed this one up,"
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.680]   or, "Nah, I wish I could have that one back."
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.840]   - There's a public figure for me thing too,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.160]   which there's a difference between changing your mind
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.680]   with a small circle of friends
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.720]   and changing your mind publicly about something,
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.920]   but it has equal, one echoes the other.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.140]   It is equally liberating, but people,
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:31.300]   people will not make that change easy,
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.140]   but it doesn't matter, that's the point.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:38.540]   I think it's ultimately liberating as a human being,
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.540]   public figure or not, to think deeply about this world
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.020]   and to keep changing, which is like,
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.140]   I think there's a deep hunger for that
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.060]   in political discourse,
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.460]   that people are so tribal currently about politics
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.020]   that they want to see somebody who says,
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.900]   "You know what, I changed my mind on this,"
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.780]   and then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions,
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.380]   keep showing that they're open-minded,
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.220]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.100]   - But when you want someone in a position of political power
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.300]   to change their mind because they realize
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.700]   that there might be a better way,
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.980]   not because they realize that by changing their mind,
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.300]   they're gonna get a new demographic to vote for them.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.020]   That's transparent as shit, nobody wants to see that.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:26.020]   Like, that's a person who can't separate their position
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.660]   from their people they're supposed to be helping.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.980]   - Yeah, and you can usually smell that.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.180]   We're just talking offline about,
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   there's something about Hillary Clinton
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:40.420]   where she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage,
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.940]   that it felt like this is a political calculation
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.060]   versus like really deeply thinking about like,
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   what things do we do in this world
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.100]   that violate basic human rights?
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.960]   Like really thinking about deeply,
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.420]   and of course politicians are calculating,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.780]   but you can see it.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.620]   This is the thing, that's why I like,
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.660]   on the human level, there's like political policies,
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.800]   but there's also humans,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.320]   and I've always liked Bernie Sanders, for example.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.680]   I don't know, not the later, perhaps, Bernie Sanders,
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.540]   but I used to listen to him back in the day,
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.860]   and it felt, and people might disagree with me,
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.740]   but it felt like there was a real human
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.340]   struggling with ideas.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.540]   Whatever, agree with him or not,
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.900]   it felt like he wasn't doing political calculation,
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.780]   he was just a human.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.220]   - He couldn't be further away from my political ideals,
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:36.220]   but also like, there's an obvious authenticity
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.560]   to his passion for what he's saying
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.820]   that is not present in other candidates,
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.300]   and you could see it,
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.540]   all these people that have been in politics forever,
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.860]   like from all the way back
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.860]   when Hillary was a lawyer in the '70s.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.100]   There's a couple of shots of her
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.780]   in a courtroom in the '70s, though,
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.540]   she's looking all right.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.420]   She's got those big glasses on.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.260]   Kind of a little bit of a nerdy babe back in the day.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.340]   - Oh, you mean like? (laughs)
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.660]   Wow, John Clark says Hillary Clinton
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.060]   was a baby back in the day.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.800]   - '73 Clinton, yeah.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.700]   - That's an interesting question
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.320]   about authenticity in politicians.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.300]   Do you think, like Hillary Clinton,
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.060]   just the Clintons in general are a good example of that.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:21.700]   Why do you think they become over time so inauthentic?
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.420]   Is it the system that changes them?
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.460]   Is it their own hunger for power?
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.320]   Is it, what is it?
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.860]   Or were they always inauthentic?
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.300]   - Well, first I'd like to say that,
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.140]   I don't know if you know this,
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.820]   but I come from a bit of a political dynasty myself.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.900]   I was on the student government several times
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.220]   in high school, and my dad won the runoff
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.260]   in a special election in Bradenton Beach, Florida.
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.300]   I think there's like 700 people there.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.660]   - So your dad got you the job?
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.620]   - Yeah, we're basically,
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.100]   a lot of people compare us to the Kennedys.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.540]   My guess with the politicians is that,
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:59.700]   and you can see it now as we're becoming more cognizant
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.140]   as people to the political process,
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.300]   I think the process corrupts people.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.980]   And I think that, I don't know the ins and outs of it.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.300]   I've listened to people who are far more educated
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.420]   on it than me, and I'm unprepared
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.440]   to cite any of their points.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.860]   I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.700]   Can I say this?
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.660]   - Yeah, I like him.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.540]   - I really liked Dan,
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.580]   especially like a year, year and a half ago.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.980]   He seemed very level-headed.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:29.300]   It's clear to me now that as he panders more and more
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.340]   to the right, it's because he's setting himself
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.060]   for a presidential run.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.700]   It's clear that that's happening.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.140]   And he just doesn't seem like the same authentic,
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.460]   ideals-oriented guy that he did a year and a half ago.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.620]   Now I could be wrong on that.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.660]   I could be way off.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.060]   But I think that you can take someone
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.340]   as honest as you want to,
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.620]   and when you start them on that path to the presidency,
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.260]   you become so unbelievably beholden
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.960]   to so many people and entities along the way,
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.540]   that by the time you get to the final destination,
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.580]   the Oval Office, all you're doing is paying back
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.020]   the favors that got you there,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.500]   and you never get to serve the people
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.860]   you're supposed to serve.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.500]   Your primary focus is on your office
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.180]   and not on the people that you're supposed to be helping.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.060]   I think that that's a humongous problem,
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.820]   and we could talk all about campaign finance reform
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.620]   in a two-party system, but at the end of the day,
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.460]   the people who are running for political posts,
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.100]   they're working to keep a job.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.740]   They're not working to improve the lives
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.420]   of the constituents, which is different.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.080]   A long, long time ago, a lot of politicians,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.460]   those were part-time jobs, and they held other posts
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.300]   out West.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.500]   They were ranchers by day and sheriff by night,
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.860]   whatever the case might be,
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.340]   but now you have such a cushy path
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.540]   for the rest of your life
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:51.140]   that the goal is to just be a politician,
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.140]   not do the things that you think a politician
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.540]   is supposed to do, and that's a problem.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.700]   - By the way, I'll talk to Dan on this.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:02.420]   It's funny, I like the version of him from a year ago,
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.820]   and I haven't been really paying attention,
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.200]   so I'll actually pay more attention now
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.800]   and ask him that exact question,
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.560]   like how do you prevent yourself from changing,
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.360]   becoming what the Clintons became.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.480]   I tend to believe, like there's conspiratorial stuff
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.920]   about Clintons and all these politicians.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.840]   I tend to believe that there were actually
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.320]   good, thoughtful people back in the day,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.760]   and the system changes them.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.360]   It's not even the system.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.640]   There's something about just the process of campaigning.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.280]   I just think it wears you down
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.920]   to where if you look at the percentage of time you spend
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.400]   on the kinds of conversations you have,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.720]   it's like one, you do these speeches,
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.000]   which you repeat the same thing over and over and over.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.620]   It beats the process of thinking.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.100]   You just exhaust your brain
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.320]   to where you're not thinking anymore,
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.280]   you're just repeating.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.360]   It's exceptionally difficult to keep making speech
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.560]   after speech after speech,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.920]   saying the same thing over and over and over again,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.880]   and at the same time, thinking deeply
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.040]   and changing your mind and learning.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.000]   And then also the pandering to financial,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.440]   having phone calls, fundraising, all those kinds of things.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.280]   - That's what they do now.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.800]   They spend most of their time fundraising.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.640]   They're not worried about anything.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.960]   Sorry to interrupt you, but I was gonna say
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.500]   that you can see there's a fuel.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:25.360]   The more attention and the higher regard you're held in
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.400]   in your community, and the more sycophants
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.480]   continue to blow smoke up your ass,
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.880]   the more it changes the way you present yourself.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.120]   And you can see it in every walk of life.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.440]   I mean, jujitsu is a tiny, tiny little section of the world,
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.200]   but you see it in the jujitsu community
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.520]   when someone all of a sudden starts a social media page
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.880]   or whatever, and they get a bunch of people
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.640]   basically cyber-follating them on their Instagram page,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.200]   they change.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.480]   - Follating, is that a word?
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   - I think so.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.880]   - So giving fellatio?
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.720]   - Yeah.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.600]   - So follating.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.440]   - Yeah.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.360]   - Jamie, look it up.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.480]   I think, but in those people, it changes their character.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.320]   - Yeah.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.840]   - It changes who they are, because they become emboldened,
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.340]   and now they've got this mythical cyber mob behind them.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.600]   - There's a sign at the entrance to your gym
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.640]   that reads, "For every moment of triumph,"
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.280]   it's a quote by Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.320]   It reads, "For every moment of triumph,
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.520]   for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled."
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.680]   What does this quote mean to you?
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.960]   - That quote to me is about, mostly about sacrifice.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.920]   And it's about, to achieve anything great
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.880]   or anything beautiful or to triumph,
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.280]   you have to have sacrificed so many things to get there,
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.000]   unless you're the most unbelievably,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.800]   genetically gifted person in the world,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.080]   and greatness is just, you know, falls upon you,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.600]   it's just raining from the sky.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.920]   I think, on your path to greatness,
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.040]   on your path to success and triumph,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.120]   you leave a lot of carnage in your wake,
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.520]   personal relationships, other goals,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.200]   things that you didn't pursue, you know,
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.760]   other unfulfilled dreams,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.920]   and you kind of have to sell a lot of that out
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   in order to be really at the peak of your field
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   or what you want to be.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.120]   I know that that's happened in my life.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.520]   I mean, there's tons and tons of relationships
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.440]   that, you know, couldn't survive
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.680]   the way that I was living my life
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.080]   because when I was trying to be a big time fighter
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.560]   or like when I was just training all the time,
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.680]   tons of relationships dissolve themselves naturally,
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.560]   some not so naturally, some people get it,
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.560]   some people don't get it, some people hate you,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.920]   you miss tons of other opportunities.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.000]   And I think that's kind of what that quote means to me.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.160]   It's about sacrifice, it's about,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.480]   you're giving up what you want now for what you want more.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:05.800]   - And it's the trampling of souls, it's messy too,
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.900]   'cause it's not clear what the right path is.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.560]   Like that sacrifice is not obvious
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.680]   that those are the right sacrifices to make.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.880]   You might be ruining your own life,
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.080]   but the fact that you're willing to take that risk
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.080]   and sort of go all in on whether it's stupid or not,
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.320]   go all in on something,
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.720]   that the possibility of creating something beautiful
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.560]   is there.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.640]   - Who says it's stupid?
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.040]   If you're going all in on it, you don't think it's stupid.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.760]   Someone else might think it's stupid,
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.000]   but I mean, who really cares?
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.480]   - Well, I'm of many minds on many things,
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.360]   so I feel like there's certain minds,
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.200]   certain moods of the day where you think it's stupid.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.960]   Like relationships is a beautiful one,
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.920]   which is, you've seen the movie "Whiplash," by any chance?
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.760]   - Yes.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   - It seems like in a man's life,
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.600]   or it could be a woman's, but I don't identify as a woman,
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.440]   so I know the man, the lived experience--
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.360]   - You did though, it's 2020, bro.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.760]   - But my lived experience for now is that of a man,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.200]   we'll see about tomorrow.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.920]   And there is, in the pursuit of excellence,
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.620]   there's often a choice of,
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:26.400]   some of the souls that must be trampled
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.640]   are personal relationships with humans in your life
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.920]   that you might deeply care about.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.400]   It could be family, it could be friends,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.760]   it could be loved ones of all different forms,
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.120]   it could be the people that, your colleagues,
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.840]   that are dependent on you, people who will lose jobs
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.800]   because of the decisions you make, all this kind of stuff.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.640]   It seems that that moment happens,
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.680]   and I'm not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.960]   To me, the movie "Whiplash,"
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.800]   for people who haven't seen, spoiler alert maybe,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.280]   I don't even know if that movie has any spoilers,
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.840]   but there is a relationship with a female,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.860]   there's a student, there's a drummer
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.400]   that's pursuing excellence
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.360]   of this particular art form of drumming,
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   and he has a brief, fleeting relationship with a female,
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.400]   and he also has an instructor
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   that's pushing him to his limits
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.640]   in what appears to be awfully a lot like
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   a toxic relationship, and he chooses, not chooses,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:31.160]   he naturally makes the decision
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.800]   to sacrifice the romantic relationship with a woman
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.360]   in further pursuit of this chaos of,
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.440]   this chaotic pursuit of excellence,
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.520]   and that doesn't feel like a deliberate decision.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.160]   It feels like a giant mess of an emotional mess
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.160]   where you're just kind of like a fish swimming against stream
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.560]   just like, fuck it.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.560]   You let go of all the things
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.320]   that convention says you should appreciate.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.760]   You throw away the possibility of a stable life,
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   of a comfortable life, of what society says
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.200]   is a meaningful life, and just pursue this crazy thing
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.960]   full of seeming toxicity
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.880]   with crazy people surrounding you.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.400]   I don't know, so I don't know what the right decision is.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.600]   Part of my brain says you should stay with the girl.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.840]   Fuck that instructor that's making you,
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.120]   that's pushing you to places where it's like,
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.200]   that are destructive, potentially destructive,
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.760]   like could lead to suicide,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.040]   could lead you to completely
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.920]   fail or fail on your pursuit of excellence
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.320]   or destroy the dream, the passionate pursuit
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.080]   of the thing that you've always dreamed for,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.440]   in that case is drumming.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.240]   I don't know, I'm on many minds there.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.560]   Like what is the right thing to do?
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.720]   - So my first two thoughts are,
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.320]   number one, fuck convention.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.280]   What is convention?
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.720]   It's like some laid out path,
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.240]   some linear progression of the way
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.840]   your life is supposed to go,
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.680]   like that someone can draw a picture of at the end.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.960]   That shit's, first of all, it's boring and whatever.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.760]   And it's, I don't wanna say that it's cowardly
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.160]   because it isn't cowardly,
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.520]   but for someone who's not conventional
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.080]   to not be non-conventional is cowardly,
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.600]   to get sucked into the convention, that's first.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.920]   Second of all, I believe that scene in the diner
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.840]   in that movie where he tells her,
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.680]   "You're in my way because I'm gonna want to be with you
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.640]   or you're going to want me to be going out
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.660]   to dinner with you and I know I should be practicing
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.120]   or I know I should be training.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.680]   And then ultimately I'm gonna make,
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.400]   I'm either gonna feel bad about not being with you
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.080]   by training or I'm gonna skip the training to be with you
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.680]   and neither one is right."
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.520]   The whole thing that they don't mention in that
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.120]   is that that's the wrong girl.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.180]   That's the wrong girl.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.880]   The right girl is a gangster.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.920]   The right girl says, "Oh, you have practice tonight?
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.880]   I'll leave you a sandwich and some milk
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.760]   so that you can, you know, outside the door.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.800]   Let me know when you're done
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.620]   or you have some like free time."
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.440]   Like the right girl compliments that.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.840]   She's not an impediment in any way.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.380]   Even if what you want to do is be with her so much
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.680]   that you're putting the drums down
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.720]   or you're putting the bass down
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.880]   or you're picking up the pizza
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.140]   or you're not going to training.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.700]   Like that girl, without even telling you
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.320]   why she's making decisions,
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.440]   is making decisions to help you achieve your goal.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.280]   Now that might sound like some sort of like
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.200]   chauvinistic king of the castle type shit,
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.220]   like where everyone should cater to you.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.920]   But the fact of the matter is
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.960]   that person is a compliment to your life
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.760]   in helping you do your thing.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.660]   And in your own way, you're helping them
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.880]   to achieve whatever their goals are also.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   It's uncommon that you have two people under the same roof
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.640]   striving to be unbelievably excellent in one small area.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.040]   It's not impossible, but it's uncommon.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.920]   Like relationships have to be like binary systems,
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.120]   like two stars.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.840]   Like the gravitational pull is what keeps you together
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.080]   and circling around one another, right?
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.440]   And one is bigger than the other and they'll fluctuate
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.200]   and the stars will get bigger and they'll get smaller
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.500]   and they'll contract based on positioning and composition.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.680]   That's the way a relationship should be.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.440]   Not an asteroid coming in to disrupt
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.080]   the surface of your planet.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.800]   It's a binary system, it's a compliment.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.760]   That girl was the wrong girl for him.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.220]   - So you shouldn't, like the big unconventional dreams
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:41.220]   should not be adjusted to fit into this world.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.860]   'Cause I mean, there is a part of me
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:43.940]   that's like full of self-doubt.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.740]   Well, maybe you're just a dick.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.020]   Maybe-- - Yeah, who cares?
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:52.820]   Lex, so first of all, who cares?
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.220]   - This is, by the way, somebody who's,
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:59.820]   you have recently gotten, well, recently,
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.540]   in the span of the history of the universe
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.140]   is recently you've gotten to a relationship,
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:07.260]   but you haven't always, you have not felt the need
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.660]   to be in the relationship just because you're supposed to
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.820]   by society's kind of momentum.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.940]   - If you, I think that if you really want anything,
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.740]   you've gotta be prepared fully to be the exact opposite.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.900]   If you're a person who's looking for a relationship,
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.740]   the only way you're gonna get in an awesome relationship
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.780]   is by being comfortable being alone.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.980]   'Cause that's the risk.
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.420]   If you're a person who's driven by money,
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.500]   you've gotta be comfortable being totally poor
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.580]   because that's the risk, right?
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.220]   And when you're constantly hedging your bets,
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.780]   you're never all in.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.420]   You're never all in on the thing you're trying to do.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.580]   A relationship has to complement your life.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:50.540]   You can't say it's okay to want to be in a relationship,
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.700]   but you can't want to be in a relationship so bad
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.340]   that you take someone in who fits the suit.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.580]   And it's like, oh, our schedules kind of work out.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.700]   You live near me and this and that and the other thing.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.700]   Because the logistics of a relationship
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.900]   are not always perfect.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.100]   What matters is when the two people are together.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.700]   That's the perfect part of it.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:13.500]   And it's great to want to meet people
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:18.500]   and say, if we meet and some sort of a relationship develops,
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.540]   I'm willing to run with it,
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.620]   but I'm not meeting you hoping a relationship develops.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.500]   I think you kind of put the cart before the horse
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.260]   in a lot of those situations.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.940]   It's like when guys meet.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.460]   No guy goes out and is like, I'm looking for a bro.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.300]   Nobody does that.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.140]   You go to the gym and you run into a bunch of dudes
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.580]   and the next thing you know, someone's cool
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.980]   and they want to talk about fighting
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.420]   and you're fucking shotgunning beers.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.020]   And all of a sudden you got a bro.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:41.860]   And that's how it works.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.180]   It works the same way with pimps.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.180]   - What's a shotgun and beers?
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.020]   - I'll show you after this.
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.300]   You poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.140]   - Yeah.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:50.980]   - Yeah, it's very--
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   - This is the problem with America.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.020]   Drink vodka like a man.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.260]   Okay, now don't poke holes in beers.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.420]   This is the problem with the frat culture.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.620]   They don't really know how to drink.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.660]   They think they know how to drink.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.980]   They don't know how to drink.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:07.940]   What do you think makes a successful relationship
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.980]   if we can linger on that a little longer?
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:15.020]   Let me ask John Clark about love.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:20.200]   I didn't ask a question, but let me just say love.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.500]   - About love.
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:31.700]   Are you one of those people who never says, "I love you"?
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.300]   - No, no.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.580]   I'm an extreme person.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.740]   And my emotions are also extreme.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.080]   And one of the things I concern myself with,
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.700]   maybe this is philosophical
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.460]   and martial arts warrior soldier type related stuff
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.320]   is I don't want anyone,
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.380]   if I die tonight on the drive home,
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.140]   hopefully that doesn't happen,
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.300]   I hope that no one is left questioning
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.460]   how I felt about them.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:02.820]   And people I don't like probably are not questioning that.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.900]   And so the thing that I've had to learn
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.660]   how to do later in life is to tell the people
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.120]   that you care about that you care about them.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.860]   And each thing can be equally off-putting
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.500]   to the receiver of the message.
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.100]   - Each thing can be equally off-putting
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:20.940]   to the receiver of the message.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:21.760]   - When you're letting someone know
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.720]   how much you dislike them,
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.140]   that can be off-putting to the person
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.300]   receiving that message.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.140]   And when you tell someone how much you care about them,
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.880]   that can also be off-putting to the person,
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.660]   depending on how they view their relationship with you.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.620]   But it's still important to get it out there.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.220]   Like you shouldn't hold those things in
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.260]   because you're worried about how they'll be received
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.600]   or if they'll come back at you.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.520]   - So you're okay going all in on these?
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.360]   - Yeah.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.760]   - Not afraid of commitment?
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.920]   - No, I'm not afraid of commitment.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.180]   Anyone who says they're afraid of commitment
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.020]   is full of shit.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:51.860]   You know what they're afraid of?
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:54.700]   They're afraid of commitment with that person.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.060]   That's what they're afraid of.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.260]   Like when someone knocks you on your ass
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.860]   and they come into your life
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.580]   and you're flushed with all these emotions,
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.940]   you're not worried about,
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.480]   oh, I don't really like commitment.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.920]   No, because they've knocked you on your ass.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.040]   You want to be with them.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.620]   You want those things.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.860]   The two most alive points in your life,
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:16.740]   I think people feel is the euphoria of a new relationship
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.940]   and then the loss when that love is gone.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.640]   You'll never feel more, I don't think,
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.080]   than in those moments in your life.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.940]   - See, the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.200]   - Yeah.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.800]   (laughing)
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.060]   - That's a Louis C.K. point that he makes,
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.060]   which is like, in his show, I think,
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.480]   is a conversation with an older gentleman
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.400]   that says that's his favorite part of the relationship
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.960]   is that period between the loss of the relationship
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.260]   and the real death, which is forgetting the person.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.080]   But that period lasts the longest
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.000]   and that's the most fulfilling.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.280]   Like missing the other person is as fulfilling
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.960]   as the actual love, the early infatuation,
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.800]   which is interesting.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.780]   I also think of the Bukowski.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.620]   I return to that.
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.820]   There's a little clip of him in an interview
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.720]   saying that love is a fog that dissipates
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.600]   with the first light of reality or something like that.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.400]   So basically emphasizing that it's this very,
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.280]   very, very fleeting thing.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.280]   That it's a moment's thing and then it just fades
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.040]   and everything else is something else.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.800]   So love is only a temporary thing, which is interesting.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.880]   I think some people say that's cynical.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.700]   I don't know.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.540]   I don't know what to think of it.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.280]   I think it's important to understand
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.400]   that everything is fleeting
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.260]   when you don't put effort into it.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.760]   Almost everything will be fleeting.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.800]   If you don't put effort into it,
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.120]   most people will get fat and lazy.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.360]   If you don't put effort into something,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.040]   you're gonna not be good at playing guitar or playing bass.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.000]   You've gotta put effort into it.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.400]   The same thing goes for a relationship.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:12.160]   That, the awesome part of it, that like love part,
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.740]   that dies soon and early on in a relationship
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.300]   because it's so good that we think
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.780]   we don't have to work at it.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.620]   But you do.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.840]   You have to keep doing the things
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.560]   and you gotta keep things new and crisp and fresh.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   And when you, different people probably feel differently
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.720]   about this, but I don't know, you walk around your girl
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.300]   and you start farting and stuff, that's when it all dies.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.160]   That's when it dies.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.520]   We're all human beings.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.380]   We're all here and our bodies work in the same way,
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:48.200]   but you start to chip away at this beautiful thing
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.200]   when you stop, when you buck conventional courtesy
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.720]   and things like that.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.120]   - Well, take it for granted, basically.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.200]   - You take it for granted, yeah.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.240]   - I mean, it's the same thing with life.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.920]   It's like, it's the same, I'm a big fan of meditating
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.100]   on death, that you could die today.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.660]   In the same way you should meditate
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.040]   on this relationship could end today.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.600]   This connection with another human could be,
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.320]   this is the last time you could be interacting.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.200]   - And your chances of that increase
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.480]   when you take it for granted and you shit on people.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.080]   But when you work at it, the chances of that decrease.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   It's never gonna be zero, but it decreases.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.200]   And when you do that, when you're the person
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.840]   and you're trying to maintain and you're trying
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.960]   to work at the relationship, you gotta make sure
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.640]   that both people are working at it.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.760]   Otherwise, you're just a fucking chump.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.500]   - Okay, let's return back to mixed martial arts.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.520]   Let me ask the ridiculous question of,
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.840]   who do you think are the top three,
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.620]   maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:56.800]   - It's so hard to compare fighters across generations.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.880]   - And maybe one way to say it is,
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.480]   which metrics would you put on the table
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.480]   as to measure what a great fighter is?
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.300]   - There was a guy named Dioxippus.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.160]   (Zubin laughs)
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.380]   In the fourth century.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:18.780]   And he was such a badass that in the Olympics in 336 BC,
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:22.020]   no one even showed up to fight him in the pancreation event.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.580]   Nobody even showed up 'cause he was fucking everybody up.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.420]   Years later, he was retired.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.040]   And this crazy Macedonian dude came there at some dinner
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.180]   for Alexander the Great.
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.640]   Everyone's chilling, drinking whatever they were drinking
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.460]   out of their chalices.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:40.740]   And this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.740]   So Dioxippus said, "Yeah, man, we'll throw down."
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.780]   And they set the time and the place.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.340]   Macedonian dude comes out,
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.340]   like body armor, spear, shield, all this other shit.
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.420]   Dioxippus came out absolutely naked with a wooden club
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.500]   and took on this much younger guy,
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:59.740]   beat the living crap out of him,
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.580]   and then put his foot on his throat,
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.140]   and then didn't even kill him
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.380]   in a show of ultimate power for the time.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:09.220]   So I think--
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.300]   - There's something about the guy being naked, too,
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.020]   it's just extra demeaning.
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.740]   - Extra demeaning, yeah.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:18.580]   - Okay, can we rephrase the question then?
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.020]   Because those are clearly going to be
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.920]   some probably forgotten warriors in history.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.660]   Let's take it to modern day mixed martial arts in the UFC.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.380]   Well, just mixed martial arts there.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.180]   Who do you think are the top fighters of all time?
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.180]   What metrics would you consider
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:38.260]   in trying to answer this perhaps unanswerable question?
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.100]   - I think one of the things you wanna think about
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.220]   is strength of opponent at the time you fought them.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:48.260]   So for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.380]   and beating him is far different
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.780]   than beating BJ Penn last year, right?
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.820]   So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:59.060]   is not the same given the time frame of when it happened.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.060]   Not to take anything away from anyone who's beaten BJ Penn.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.340]   Just use that as an example of someone whose career
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:07.820]   went into a different direction.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:12.820]   I would say the guy who I think is probably the best
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:17.340]   that people are the least familiar with
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.740]   would be Murillo Bustamante.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.260]   And I think he was a guy who was one of the guys
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.780]   with the first really good physical build for MMA,
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.860]   which I think is narrow from the chest to the back
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:32.300]   and long shoulder to shoulder
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.940]   and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.740]   That was a guy who could box.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.100]   That was a guy who could wrestle.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.940]   And that was a guy who had great jujitsu.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.740]   He wasn't a great kickboxer,
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.180]   but at the time he didn't need it.
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:46.740]   Fought everybody and gave everybody a run.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:50.060]   I think he's probably one of those guys
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.740]   who's gotta be considered.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:55.180]   - Yeah, there's a few killers that never,
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.980]   'cause like why is he not in the discussion?
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:02.060]   'Cause like I think greatness requires
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.780]   both the skill and the opportunity to meet each other.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:08.020]   - And when you talk about a fighter,
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:10.340]   the other thing that really a good fighter
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.340]   needs to become great is a foil.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:13.180]   - Yeah.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:15.540]   - And so many fighters don't have a foil.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.140]   That's one of the biggest attractions,
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.220]   I think, of early Mike Tyson's career.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.460]   He didn't have a foil.
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.980]   He had no one driving him.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.100]   And by the time he did,
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.140]   by the time he had a foil in Holyfield,
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:26.740]   his career was in a different place.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.620]   - But he's one of the greats all the time
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.100]   and he never really had a foil.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:35.100]   So his greatness was in unparalleled destruction
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:40.980]   of like nobody's, well, of lesser opponents.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:45.260]   - Right, and so when people debate
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.020]   the level of greatness of Mike Tyson,
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:49.060]   that's one of the things they say.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.940]   Like he didn't fight a lot of killers in their prime.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.980]   I think you've obviously gotta say in that conversation,
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:58.420]   I have a really difficult time
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.060]   keeping George St. Pierre out of the conversation.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.420]   Only because he was able to beat you with anything.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.780]   He could out jab you, he could out wrestle you,
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.980]   and he could submit you.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.060]   The problem I have with Fedor is his career
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:19.020]   also took a drastic turn towards the end.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.140]   When he was fighting in Pride,
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.820]   he was doing a lot more grappling
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.740]   and then he just started casting that over him
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:26.620]   right at people.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.580]   And his game kind of changed at that point.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.180]   You can't take anything away from his greatness,
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:36.100]   but at that time, the great heavyweights
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.620]   were not really fighting in Pride
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.820]   and they didn't really exist yet.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.220]   And by the time he fought a really good one,
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:44.100]   Fabricio Verdum, he did get submitted there.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.980]   - Does his later performance color your
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.300]   and our perception of his greatness?
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.860]   In general about fighters.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.340]   - Not mine, but I'm someone who's like
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.300]   intimately involved in the sport.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.740]   But it colors everyone else's.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.140]   Same with Anderson Silva.
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.500]   I don't think Anderson Silva doesn't wanna fight
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.620]   in like seven years or something.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.100]   Or is it one?
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:07.980]   That's a guy who in his prime was one of the best fighters.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.580]   - Is he in the top five for you?
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.060]   - I think he's probably in the top five, yeah.
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:13.020]   - Greatest striker of all time or no?
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:13.860]   - In MMA?
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.020]   - In mixed martial arts.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.260]   - In mixed martial arts?
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.660]   That's a tough question.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.340]   The greatest MMA striker of all time.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.920]   - 'Cause the timing,
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.660]   we were talking about foot sweeps, right?
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:31.460]   Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:36.460]   - I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime,
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.980]   it's gotta be Anderson Silva.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:41.900]   And I think you have to consider discussing Lyoto Machida
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.580]   for his unbelievable manipulation of distance.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.380]   Which is something that people don't really talk
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.980]   too much about in terms of fighting
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.780]   unless you're someone in the sport.
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:54.380]   His use of distance and the ability to like
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:57.860]   what we call pop out, like make you miss by one inch
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.980]   so that he could follow your fist back in
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.920]   as you retract it and then hit you over the top,
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.220]   that's a thing of beauty.
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.580]   Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker,
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.260]   when he got to his prime in the UFC,
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.860]   that was a thing of beauty.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.580]   That was a thing of beauty.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.100]   So I think definitely those two guys
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.580]   and Murillo Bustamante's gotta be the third guy.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.180]   There's just so many good guys now.
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.140]   - So where do you put, in terms of metrics,
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.940]   you mentioned GSP and Anderson Silva,
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.740]   I think they have a large number of defenses of a title.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.140]   Is that important to you?
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.780]   Like this kind of consistent domination?
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:36.180]   - No, because it's easily manipulated
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.280]   by the people making money off the fights.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.620]   So there was a great quote one time
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.340]   when UFC was coming to prominence
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:46.740]   and Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said,
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:51.340]   "The difference between what we do and what UFC does
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:54.660]   "is that when we have a superstar,
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.220]   "I can make sure he stays on top
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.540]   "until he's no longer a superstar
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.700]   "because we have predetermined results.
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.860]   "The UFC can't do that
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.340]   "because they're actually having fights."
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.700]   Well, it's true and false.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.820]   You can't do that, but you can give your superstars
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.380]   the most favorable matchups
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.220]   to keep them on top for the longest.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.180]   So people always talk about title defenses
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.660]   as if the guy they're fighting, the challenger,
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:17.300]   is always the person most deserving of the shot.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.140]   And it's just not true.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.340]   So I don't put that much stock in it.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:24.380]   - Is it possible to put a guy in consideration
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:27.420]   as one of the greats if all they had
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.140]   is one or two amazing fights?
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.100]   I'll tell you, like, and amazing could be
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.420]   a lot of different definitions.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.820]   It could be just a war.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.500]   Like, they never really reached
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.900]   the highest of excellences of domination,
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.420]   but they've, like, we had this discussion
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.620]   about Kyle Bokniak, right?
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.460]   - Yep.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:50.860]   - To me, that's a perfect example.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:55.860]   He had this famous fight against Zabit Magomedsharipov
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:34:04.020]   where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:07.140]   and Zabit, like, just a very good striker.
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:13.340]   And then there's, like, the warrior on the Kyle side.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.660]   And just the fight,
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:16.380]   they created something special together.
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:17.580]   It was a fight of the night, whatever,
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:22.620]   but that fight was special on that night
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.860]   because the two dance partners.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.700]   - You can have a great performance
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.900]   without being a great fighter.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.660]   Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter,
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.380]   but to answer your first question,
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:36.220]   I think that having one or two great performances
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.380]   does not necessarily mean that you are great.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.900]   I need a larger sample size.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.740]   I have no idea what that is.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.820]   I don't have any idea what that is.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.660]   And also,
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.820]   (clears throat)
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:52.260]   how much weight does toughness have
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.980]   when you're thinking about the criteria
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.420]   when you define a great fighter?
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:59.020]   That's a good question.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.780]   And I don't have the answer to it.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:03.260]   - I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.500]   through brute force.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.140]   They didn't bring the skillset to the table
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:09.660]   that perhaps some of the greats have,
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:12.300]   but they rose to the occasion.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.780]   I mean, there's something about that.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:14.620]   - There's something about that.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.940]   And so now we're more talking about the internal attributes
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.300]   as opposed to the external physical attributes.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.340]   And those are the things I think that you cannot teach.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.660]   Those things, you come in the door
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.860]   and you either have that or you don't.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.980]   I think, and we talk about this all the time,
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.940]   and this is one of the things
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.180]   where my mind changes regularly.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:37.800]   Like on what makes a fighter, is it born or is it bred?
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   And this week I'm of the opinion that it's in you
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.520]   and maybe it's in you and you suppress it
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.180]   and people can tease it out of you,
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.080]   but I don't think you can make someone
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.000]   who doesn't have that seed in there.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.040]   I don't think you can turn them into that great warrior
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.320]   with that level of grit and mental toughness.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:00.080]   Now, when that fight, when Kyle fought Zabit,
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.200]   it's a unique situation for both guys.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.320]   It was kind of a later replacement fight for Kyle.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.280]   Zabit's star was on the rise
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:11.180]   and Kyle put the blueprint out there on how to beat Zabit.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.480]   - Which is?
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.800]   - Which is pressure him
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.200]   and try and drag him into the late rounds.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.600]   You notice that later on when Calvin Cater fought him,
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.800]   they wouldn't give him five rounds.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.760]   They wanted five rounds and Zabit's camp,
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.580]   from what I understand,
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:26.360]   would not agree to the five round fight.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.420]   - Well, he didn't look, right,
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.680]   so with Kyle it was a three round fight.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.520]   - It's a three round fight.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.960]   - And what did, it went to decision?
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.800]   - It went to decision.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.280]   Zabit won the decision, clearly,
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.760]   which is-- - Did Kyle have a shot
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.440]   at winning the third round?
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.720]   - I don't remember the exact score,
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.160]   but Kyle could've won the third round
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.300]   had he done a couple things differently,
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.540]   but I do believe in the fourth round,
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.060]   I think Kyle would've won a fourth round
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.080]   and I think maybe even won the fight
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.560]   if there would've been a fifth round.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.300]   - And he was pressing forward,
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.040]   perhaps in a funny way,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.480]   now you could tell me I'm wrong,
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.120]   but it felt like he wasn't emphasizing head movement
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:04.960]   at that point.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.920]   He went full Mike Tyson.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.640]   - There was a point at which,
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.200]   so it's funny that you say that.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.320]   - Which is a contradiction, actually, because--
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.960]   - Mike Tyson had great head movement.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.020]   - I actually don't know exactly what I mean,
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.800]   because he was in the pocket,
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.160]   I think he was trying to do the movement,
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.280]   he was just in the pocket and pressing forward,
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.800]   and the fuck you attitude of just not--
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.680]   - That was a little bit later
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.640]   when Zabit's back was towards the cage.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.480]   - Towards the end of the round.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.560]   - We get that fight,
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.520]   and I said to Kyle, I was like,
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   "Look, this kid has been training martial arts
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.120]   "since he was three years old.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.040]   "There's not an area where you're gonna out-technique him,
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.300]   "and so we've gotta now channel some of that grit
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.300]   "that we know you have.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.480]   "This is an opportunity to showcase it."
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.400]   And I don't know how long I did it for,
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.340]   'cause Kyle's much shorter than Zabit.
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.800]   So for a good long while,
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.000]   while we were training for Zabit,
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.360]   I didn't even say anything,
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.760]   and I just had clips of Mike Tyson training
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.240]   on the TV in the gym, and the head movement,
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.520]   and I didn't even mention it.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.680]   And then we started to get into it,
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.960]   and talk about getting inside the length
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.600]   of the longer fighter, and things like that.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.760]   And we kind of, which, when some people train MMA,
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.700]   they say, "Okay, this guy's a really good wrestler.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.400]   "Let's think about avoiding the wrestling,
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.000]   "or being a better wrestler."
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.260]   And I think that when the difference in skill is so great,
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.860]   those are both the wrong answer.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.400]   If a guy who's a really good wrestler
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.280]   wants to take you down,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.600]   and you don't have a lot of wrestling experience,
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.760]   he's probably gonna get you down
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.640]   if he's got a good coach, right?
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   So you have to deal with that.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.440]   To then say, "I'm gonna then learn in eight weeks
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.600]   "how to wrestle better than a guy
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.280]   "who's been wrestling since he was eight years old,"
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.520]   is also a bad idea.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.360]   So what we concentrated on for that camp,
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.520]   and it worked beautifully,
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.960]   was not getting caught in chain wrestling.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.120]   These are the takedowns you're gonna get caught with.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.520]   This is how to not get caught with the next step
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.680]   while you're defending takedown one.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.240]   'Cause it's the chain of techniques
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.200]   that are gonna get you fucked, right?
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.920]   So we did a ton of work on get-ups,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.840]   and breaking the hands from the various takedowns.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:02.680]   It was a while ago now,
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:05.320]   so I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.640]   But we concentrated on defend the first takedown
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.280]   and stay out of the chain.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.760]   Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques,
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.080]   'cause you will be out-wrestled.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.120]   And that was really successful.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.800]   And then the third round, Sabit was tired.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.800]   - He was tired.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:21.640]   - Sabit got tired.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.040]   He cuts a tremendous amount of weight.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.340]   I can't see him staying at 145 forever
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.160]   when they start giving him five-round fights.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.680]   I don't even know if he's had a five-round fight yet.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.520]   He may have,
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.000]   but I can't see him staying down there.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.120]   The guy's like 6'1".
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.000]   Guys, he's a giant of a guy.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.640]   So Kyle pressed forward there,
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.480]   and he said he felt that there was no power left
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.320]   in Sabit's hands,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.920]   and so he felt fine.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.200]   And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.680]   as he moved forward,
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:53.680]   and saw that he wasn't taking a lot of damage,
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.320]   like the punches weren't staying him.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.660]   He started walking right through him.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.160]   - It goes to your question of what makes a fighter.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.200]   Was him walking forward like that
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.920]   something that you're born with,
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.520]   or is that something you were training?
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.360]   Is that the Mike Tyson on TV?
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.700]   - He's born with that.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.220]   Kyle is born with that.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.600]   And the crowd, I've been in a lot--
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:17.480]   - Was it in Boston?
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.320]   - No, it was in New York.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.160]   It was in Brooklyn.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.340]   I've been in a lot of arenas
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:21.680]   for a lot of different sporting events.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.780]   That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:24.620]   when he did that.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.120]   I was going crazy.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.860]   And you ask about that being taught or not.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:31.580]   Kyle is so much like that
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.780]   that I have to try and tease some of that out of him
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.020]   to pull it back.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:39.780]   Because he's also so very technical when he wants to be
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.260]   that the emotion and the fun of it
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.020]   gets in the way of his technique,
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.580]   and probably has cost him a couple of wins.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.420]   And so that's one of the things
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:49.380]   we work on with him right now,
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:52.340]   is staying within yourself, being a professional,
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:55.020]   taking your time to download the information in round one,
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.840]   and then starting your fight in round two.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.480]   - But the tension between those two things
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.780]   is what makes, what on that day created one of the,
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:06.760]   in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I've ever seen.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.920]   Joe Rogan agrees.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.200]   - Yeah, it's one of the greatest fights
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.640]   I've certainly ever seen.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.960]   - So it's funny that you as a coach,
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.400]   I can see the frustration of throwing away
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.640]   some of the strategy kind of thing.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.240]   Like you seeing, being not happy
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.140]   that there could be things that he could have done
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.100]   to win the fight?
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:26.980]   - It's in retrospect.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.580]   I think that at that time,
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.820]   we were playing with incredible house money.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.220]   Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.420]   Zabit was unstoppable.
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.900]   I think people were probably picking him
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:37.260]   to finish the fight in round one.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.100]   I think at that point,
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:40.140]   no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit.
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:43.380]   And no one certainly had put that kind of performance
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:47.340]   together, and I think Kyle put the blueprint out there.
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:51.400]   And in retrospect, when I look at the last round,
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.240]   yeah, there were things
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.540]   that could have been done differently,
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.220]   but we're playing with house money at that point.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.980]   Like, I mean, let it fly.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.140]   You get to a point where you've got it,
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.580]   you're down three rounds and there's 20 seconds left.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.500]   You got to move all your chips to the center of the table
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.580]   and see what happens.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.540]   - Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.700]   I remember like he got won over.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.020]   I think I have trouble remembering
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.580]   'cause offline we talked about that fight
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.500]   and he's exceptionally impressed by it.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500]   I mean, Joe's from Boston.
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:20.900]   I mean, there's a story there.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:21.820]   - Okay.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:25.340]   - It sucks not, you naturally want to romanticize,
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.500]   like there's a Rocky versus like,
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.420]   there's a Rocky IV, a Draga.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:34.480]   I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:40.620]   Kyle's style represents the American ideal, right?
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:41.440]   The spirit.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.580]   - Yeah, I mean, he's from Gloucester.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.780]   It's like you could have dragged him off the docks
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.540]   three hours before the fight and said,
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.500]   "Hey, you want to go fight?"
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.340]   And he would have said yes.
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.980]   - Oh man, that was a special fight.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.820]   But that's as per discussion
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.580]   of like greatest fighters of all time.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.620]   I tend to believe that that fight is more special
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   than the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.340]   You know, there's something to that.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:11.340]   It's like Rocky I is more special than like Rocky III.
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:19.780]   Right, so like it's the underdog or whatever,
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:21.900]   like the dance partners that go into war
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.540]   and like that moment, I mean, it's bigger.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.940]   It's bigger than any individual fighter.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.020]   They create that.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.020]   And that, I know it's not perhaps good for a career.
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.260]   It's not good for like in terms of money,
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.300]   in terms of longevity, in terms of all those kinds of things,
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.020]   but that's a special moment in the history of fighting
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:40.140]   that you both created.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:42.580]   - I can remember like right after,
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:45.060]   like there was so much excitement in the air
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.160]   during the third round.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.460]   And I remember being in the corner
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.660]   and like I was so excited at the end of it
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:53.060]   that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:53.900]   I didn't even know.
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.620]   And I looked to Sean, one of the other corner men,
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:58.860]   and I think I said to him, "Did we win?"
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.220]   When you rewatch the fight,
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:01.380]   clearly we didn't win the fight.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.500]   I mean, we lost the other rounds,
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.020]   but I got so caught up in that moment.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.040]   And then I just remember like,
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.380]   I was so in awe of his performance
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:12.380]   that like I forgot what was going on.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:16.060]   And it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:18.340]   and to stay within yourself and try and like coach,
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:20.660]   but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.660]   It's like, we're rumbling, we got 30 seconds,
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.500]   we're trying to win here.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.580]   And I remember like the performance itself,
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.040]   I'm not a fan of moral victories,
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.140]   but if ever there was gonna be one, that was one.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.140]   And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle,
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:35.500]   like they hadn't even been to the center of the cage yet.
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.440]   And I just hugged him and I said, "You're my fucking hero."
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.420]   And I remember being very emotional about that,
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.260]   that I was able to be a part of that.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.460]   - It feels wrong to say,
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.860]   but I kind of avoided saying it,
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.740]   but if I'm being honest with my feelings,
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:52.380]   this is a safe space for feelings.
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.620]   Is I think it was the greatest
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:59.180]   mixed martial arts fight I've ever seen.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:00.760]   And I don't think I'm being biased.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.840]   I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.980]   I honestly don't think so.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.380]   I think that was the greatest fight.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:08.300]   Like if you wanna rank fights I've ever seen,
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.780]   I think to me that was the greatest fight I've ever seen.
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:13.800]   - It certainly was one of the greatest displays
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.900]   of like just dogged effort from an underdog
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:22.500]   who was out experienced and probably outsized.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:26.180]   But I mean, like you're just, Kyle's one of those kids
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.980]   you're never gonna tell him he's out of a fight.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.900]   He has something you can't teach.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:34.900]   And I've seen tons of people with more physical attributes
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.820]   and they're just mental midgets
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.700]   and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:42.220]   And Kyle is not that.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.320]   And you can't teach it no matter what you do.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.080]   But that was, I would say like my career in combat sports
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.280]   which spans, if you wanna go all the way back
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.980]   to like wrestling, like that was one of probably
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.400]   the greatest experiences I've been a part of.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.960]   It's a bittersweet sport.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.240]   She's a fickle mistress.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.080]   - Yeah, I mean, the tragic aspect of that is
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.580]   like, I guess Kyle lost, right?
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.560]   So like, if you look at the record
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.320]   and all the kind of things, perhaps like you look
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.340]   at the career, maybe like as a financial,
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:24.480]   from a financial perspective that perhaps is not
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:28.360]   the greatest thing for Kyle's career
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:33.360]   or in the history of the UFC, perhaps it's not,
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.440]   you know, like maybe many people didn't even watch
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.680]   that fight, but it was a special moment
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.860]   that stands in the history.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:44.900]   There's not many of these in the history of fighting.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.260]   - But at the end of the day, when you look
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:51.100]   at someone's career in the UFC, like financially,
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:54.840]   there's a handful of people that make real money.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.540]   Everybody else makes nothing.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.700]   There's a handful of people that make real money.
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:02.420]   So did that loss cost him in the near term?
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.200]   Sure, but when you look back on your life,
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.580]   you're not gonna look back on that loss
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.700]   as something that derailed my life financially
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:08.860]   and I never recovered from it.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:10.540]   That's not gonna happen.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:13.140]   Like the sad thing is, is unless you were a champion
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.540]   and you know, most people are gonna be forgotten
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.920]   right after they're gone.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.180]   Most people will be forgotten.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:21.340]   And if you're not forgotten, certainly your accolades
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.460]   are gonna be misrepresented.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.500]   Either they're gonna be inflated or diminished
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:25.320]   one way or the other.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:30.320]   So looking back on it, it's just so hard to quantify that,
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:34.500]   but it's an experience and like when you're in that moment
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.060]   and you're one of the people like intimately involved in it,
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.380]   like the value of that experience
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:42.440]   supersedes any financial gain.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.620]   - Where would you put Khabib in the discussion
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:48.580]   of the greatest of all time?
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.660]   So you recently, we worked together,
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:55.660]   we watched the fight of him and Justin Gaethje
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.700]   and Khabib retired.
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:02.100]   Would you put him up there as one of the greatest
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:05.300]   or did he never truly find his foil
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:08.460]   that like the great warrior that challenged him?
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:13.460]   And maybe do you think he's fully retired now?
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.580]   - To answer the question about being fully retired,
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.620]   I don't have any idea.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:21.620]   I can't for a second pretend to think that I understand
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:24.700]   the way that people from that part of the world think
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:26.900]   and respect their family and things like that.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.900]   To an American who says, "Oh, I promised my mom
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:29.740]   "I wouldn't do it."
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.660]   I mean, I promised my mom I wouldn't do a lot of things.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.940]   I went right out the fucking back door and did them.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.020]   But I think that that means something different
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:37.940]   to people in different parts of the world.
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:41.260]   So I have no idea what kind of weight that carries.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.780]   So I can't answer that.
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:45.980]   I can say a lot of times when people think
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:48.820]   about great fighters, they think about the aspects
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.540]   that make up MMA.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:52.880]   Like they think of MMA as a pie
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.100]   and there are all these different pieces
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.300]   that make up the pie.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:57.340]   And how good is this piece?
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:58.180]   And how good is this piece?
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:48:59.780]   And how good is this piece?
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:01.340]   When the fact of the matter is,
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.280]   you only need one really, really, really good piece
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.320]   and the other pieces are complimentary pieces
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.600]   to get you to where you're the strongest.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.400]   And if you wanna tell me that Khabib's not
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.160]   the greatest MMA fighter because he doesn't have
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.200]   really slick striking, you can make that argument.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.160]   But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough striking
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.840]   to get him to his grappling where he is clearly
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.360]   the best guy at 155 they've ever seen.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.120]   So does that make him the greatest fighter
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.840]   in that division or not?
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.520]   To your point about the foil,
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.360]   they wanted Conor to be his foil
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.080]   and he just manhandled them.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.280]   I mean, they wanted that to happen.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.320]   It did not happen.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.140]   So--
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.360]   - Well, there's a kind of argument to be made
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.000]   which we kind of, you get haters in this argument.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.160]   And you're gonna be one of the haters
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.320]   because I know your, how should I put it,
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.340]   lack of admiration for Conor McGregor.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.600]   But what is it, football is a game of inches?
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.480]   There's a sense where,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.360]   that Conor, there's an argument to be made
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.040]   that Conor wasn't exactly dominated.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.240]   That he ended up being dominant,
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.680]   meaning, let me phrase it differently,
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:20.280]   is there's a lot of points in the fight
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.760]   that it could have, a different trajectory
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.580]   could have happened.
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.480]   So he wasn't so far from having a chance
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.600]   at winning that fight.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.240]   It's just the end, you can focus--
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.040]   - Those are the most important moments at the end.
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.760]   You've lost the most important moments.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.960]   - Right, but the road less taken,
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.720]   it could have been, if he didn't lose
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.520]   those very important moments, he had a chance.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.720]   So I'm saying out of all the people that could be fought,
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.080]   it's arguable that Conor was up there
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.080]   of the people that had a chance.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.640]   - Let me say this first.
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:56.440]   - I'm gonna get so much heat for this.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.120]   - I do love Khabib, I'm a huge Khabib fan
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.200]   because I'm a grappler first and foremost.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.040]   - Me too, because I'm also Russian.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.640]   I love Khabib, calm down.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.480]   (laughing)
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.320]   Okay.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.800]   - But when Conor came on the scene,
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.840]   I loved Conor because I'm an Irish American
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.800]   and I wanna support him and things like that.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.560]   And he was good fun.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.960]   He got to be, for my personal taste,
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.100]   he got to be too much.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:22.240]   Of all the people Khabib has fought,
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.440]   I would never fight Conor again if I were him.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.240]   And here's why, and I said this about the Diaz fight.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.240]   Nate Diaz, who was one of my favorite fighters,
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.720]   has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.560]   Conor will switch something up to give himself an edge.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.440]   And I believe that Conor would figure something out
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.800]   in fight number two, I think,
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.440]   but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.320]   where it wouldn't be a matter of,
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.800]   I'm gonna out-wrestle Khabib
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:54.040]   or become better at defending his wrestling takedowns.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.560]   Conor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled,
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.400]   I feel like.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.440]   He's constantly changing, he's constantly evolving.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.520]   And whether or not people realize it or not,
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:05.480]   I think Conor's one of the better overall athletes in MMA,
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.800]   just from looking at his body and his movement
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:08.800]   and the way he's shaped.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.240]   He's got a very tiny waist,
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.080]   he's got really pronounced glutes and shoulders.
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.400]   And I think he's for a real athlete,
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.540]   whereas a lot of guys in MMA are not for real athletes.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.400]   They're just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.720]   I understand what you're saying about
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.560]   if this happened, if that happened,
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.480]   but I mean, you could say that
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.680]   about every single combat sports event ever.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:32.280]   If Spinks' hook landed on Tyson,
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.740]   maybe that fight didn't end the way that it did.
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.820]   But you know what?
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:36.940]   It didn't.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.800]   - You're absolutely right.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.340]   But if we could talk about just Conor McGregor for a second.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:46.340]   I can't wait to get your fan mail or hate mail.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:50.400]   Speak to the innovation of Conor.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.260]   I don't hear very many people making this argument,
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:56.360]   but is it possible to make an argument
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.680]   that Conor McGregor is one of the greatest fighters
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.320]   of all time?
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.480]   - It's an interesting argument.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.840]   And the only problem with the argument
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.020]   is there's so much emotion on either side.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.280]   - Yeah, I had a conversation, sorry to interrupt,
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:13.280]   with Yaron Brook, who's a philosopher, objectivist,
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:18.860]   which is the philosophy of Ayn Rand.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:22.760]   And the amount of emotion around that particular human
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.720]   is fascinating to me.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:27.320]   It's similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.120]   You can think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.240]   - Those are the people that aren't willing
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.280]   to have their mind changed.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:34.640]   They're too emotionally attached to the argument.
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:37.400]   - Yeah, but it's weird that why do we,
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:42.040]   why some people inspire so much emotion and others don't.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:46.040]   But Conor McGregor, I feel like nobody's able
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:51.040]   to have a calm fight analysis of the guy.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:57.200]   Look, to me, as just a fan of martial arts,
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.800]   I study judo.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:02.340]   I love watching just hours of Olympic judo
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.680]   and appreciating the art form.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.960]   I forget the humans involved.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.160]   Teddy Renner, who's a heavyweight,
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.920]   probably the most dominant heavyweight
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.600]   in the history of judo, just studying his gripping,
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.160]   just the art of it.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.320]   And who cares if there's shit talking?
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:21.840]   Like to me, I put all of that aside
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.440]   and just look at the art.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:27.840]   And like what I really appreciate about Conor McGregor
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.840]   is his innovation, like of movement,
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:36.960]   of maybe it's romanticized, maybe you can correct me.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:41.600]   I'm just a Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.320]   But I seem to detect more innovation
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.520]   than almost any other fighter
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.600]   that I've paid attention to in Conor McGregor.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:54.160]   - I think first, I'll answer in two parts.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:56.480]   I think, well, I'm not gonna answer the first part.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.680]   It's just a comment 'cause you didn't ask the question.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.520]   - What was the question?
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.720]   I don't even remember.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.680]   - It's about how Conor McGregor fans are very emotional
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:07.200]   and Conor McGregor detractors are very emotional.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:09.000]   I think fans become very emotional.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.280]   They become cheerleaders of someone like Conor McGregor
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.800]   or Donald Trump because they see that person
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.720]   exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.520]   And so they become cheerleaders for that.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.800]   And I think that for the most part,
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.360]   people who are detractors of Conor McGregor's,
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.680]   they're not really Conor McGregor detractors.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:28.300]   They're detractors of Conor's supporters.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.620]   There's a beef that they have
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.200]   with the people in that bucket.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.200]   It's not really a problem with Conor.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:37.240]   - And that applies probably in our current political climate
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:39.400]   with Donald Trump with the left and the right.
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:44.320]   It's more about like they actually don't like
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.400]   on the other, the caricature, the most extreme versions
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.360]   of what they see in the supporters of the other side.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.200]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:52.440]   But I think the more interesting thing
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:53.520]   is the fighter himself.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.640]   So let's put the supporters aside.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.600]   - I would say that what some people know
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:02.640]   and some people don't know is that Conor's base is in karate
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.520]   and the karate style of Conor McGregor,
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:10.600]   Stephen Thompson, of Leota Machida,
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.640]   that type of distance management,
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.540]   a lot of times we think as martial artists,
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:17.460]   we think that the sport version of the art
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:21.080]   we've chosen to pursue somehow taints the authenticity
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.040]   and the effectiveness of it.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.560]   But point karate is what led to that in and out
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.960]   distance management style of Conor,
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.120]   of Leota and of Stephen Thompson.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.420]   They all kind of use it a little bit differently,
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:36.280]   but they use it very effectively, all three of them.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:41.200]   And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.880]   step in, land contact on you from my point,
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:47.000]   and then get back out before you can counter strike me.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.040]   Right, and that's where that comes from.
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:52.400]   Conor's blessed to have longer arms
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.880]   than someone his height probably normally has.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.720]   And his movement is just so fluid.
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.580]   He's so athletic with the hinges of his body,
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:04.840]   the knees and the hips and the swivel of his body,
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.880]   which is also the hips and the shoulders.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.800]   His movement, his distance,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.760]   and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.240]   while you're circling away from it,
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:15.160]   and he can still land it,
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.080]   which is what he did to Chad Mendes.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.040]   Hit him with a straight left
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.140]   while he was circling away from it.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:24.120]   That is something that is very beautiful to watch.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.160]   And sometimes people see the kicks
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:30.780]   and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the sidekicks.
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:32.120]   All that stuff is doing
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:34.200]   is setting people up for the left hand.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.360]   It's all it's doing.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.200]   You're corralling people, you're funneling people,
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.480]   or you're leading the dance,
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.660]   and you're bringing them to a spot
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.800]   where you know you can land that left hand.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.840]   And his ability to do that is masterful.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.880]   People constantly shit on his ability to grapple
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.140]   because a couple of his losses have been to jujitsu guys
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.440]   or grapplers, but they've been to really good guys.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.820]   Anyone who's gonna sit here and tell me
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.260]   Conor McGregor's not a good grappler, go grapple him.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.080]   Let me see you grapple him.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.080]   To that point, I'll also say a lot of people
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.440]   will use Conor McGregor's X-guard sweep on Nate Diaz
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.560]   as evidence to his high level grappling in that fight,
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.500]   to which I would also counter.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.840]   Nate Diaz didn't fight that off
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.860]   because he knew he was so much better at jujitsu
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:19.680]   off the bottom that he didn't even care if he got swept.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.880]   So is Conor McGregor innovative?
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.740]   Absolutely.
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:25.560]   Is he one of the best fighters ever?
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.600]   It's tough to say because he's such a cash cow
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.960]   that he was fed people.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.840]   I firmly believe no one who put that Conor McGregor-Khabib
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.640]   fight together thought Khabib would win.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.200]   - Wow.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.960]   I remember, so at that time, it was not completely clear
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:45.240]   there was a myth of the great Khabib.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.440]   It wasn't completely clear how good is he really.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.840]   So that's interesting.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.160]   And it was unclear how good is Conor also.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.360]   'Cause I think to me, maybe part of my admiration
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:01.800]   of Conor McGregor is rooted in the fact
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:05.360]   that I thought there's no way he beats Jose Aldo.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:09.200]   And I thought there's definitely no way he beats Eddie Alvarez.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:13.200]   And so when he did, I was like,
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:18.080]   I had to, my brain was like, there's something broken.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.240]   It was shut down on Windows, like froze.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.760]   We have to rethink this.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.400]   Like, this is a special human.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.800]   Now, people who argue he's not even in the running
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:28.360]   of like top 20 is, you know,
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.400]   if you look at the number of defenses, for example,
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.680]   of his belt that he had, very, very little.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.600]   But like, to me, I'm one of those people
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.560]   is back to our discussion of like,
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.360]   do moments make great fighters?
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:41.800]   That I think just being able to beat Jose Aldo,
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:44.920]   I would argue in his prime, some people might disagree,
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.920]   in this, in a way where he like figures out the puzzle,
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.960]   gets in his head, the entirety of the picture.
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:57.600]   And then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez,
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:00.480]   would he be considered a really strong wrestler?
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:05.480]   Like, or not strong wrestler, strong striker and wrestler,
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.800]   the whole combination of it.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.400]   And also, what's the other wrestler he fought?
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:10.720]   - Chad Mendes. - Chad Mendes.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:13.560]   - So let me comment on all those, if I may.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.400]   So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.240]   - Yeah.
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:18.880]   - And there was a Jiu-Jitsu tournament, we're out in Vegas.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.240]   And so me and my best friend came out
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.480]   and we got some tickets.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.360]   That night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:27.340]   Aldo got hurt, like right after I bought the tickets.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.760]   They pulled Chad Mendes in,
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.440]   he was a little bit out of shape, whatever.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.400]   You still gotta fight the fight.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.320]   But I don't wanna use that fight
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.840]   as evidence to Conor's greatness,
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.760]   because they pulled Chad Mendes in,
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.920]   he was like hunting and drinking beers in the woods,
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:43.520]   and was a little out of shape.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:45.480]   But if you wanna talk about greatness
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:49.860]   like that surpasses your in-ring accomplishments,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.800]   I was in the stands that night,
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.480]   and the people that came from Ireland
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:58.120]   to see Conor fight that night,
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:02.000]   single-handedly set the market for hotel room prices
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.200]   and airline tickets to Vegas that weekend.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:08.040]   These motherfuckers were all dressed like Conor
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:08.880]   in the stands.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.600]   - Yeah. - They had wool suits on
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.240]   and big beards and the whole thing.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:14.560]   I mean, they were probably wearing pocket watches.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:19.120]   I never saw more people trying to be someone else.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.600]   Never saw more people try to be someone else.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.120]   I mean, there's a level of,
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.600]   is there a level of greatness in that?
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.720]   I mean, I don't know how to parse all that out.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:28.440]   - You're somebody who doesn't admire that.
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:30.840]   I love that in the following sense.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:34.560]   I think that people don't seem to hold this belief at all,
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.980]   but to me, fighting is not just,
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:42.600]   this isn't like a quiet street fight that nobody watches.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:43.840]   This is also a spectacle.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.600]   This is also a story.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:48.880]   There's a professional wrestling element to this.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.560]   This is not, you think it's just about fighting.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.240]   If it was just about fighting, you wouldn't,
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.760]   I mean, there's a story to it, I guess,
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:58.600]   is what I'm trying to get to. - Yeah, you're right.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:01.280]   - And greatness has to incorporate that.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:04.320]   People that criticize, again, I might be wrong on this,
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.600]   but I honestly think that Conor McGregor,
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.080]   not nearly as much as Khabib,
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.480]   but he's a true martial artist.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:15.040]   - I believe that. - I think he respects
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.600]   his opponents despite the talk.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.240]   Maybe I'm misreading it,
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.280]   but it feels like he is a storyteller,
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.120]   like a Chael Sonnen type of,
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:29.080]   he's constructed this image to play the story.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.160]   Just the way he acts after the fight,
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.520]   the honor he shows to his opponents.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.000]   There's a real martial artist in there,
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.720]   and to dismiss the fact that
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:42.600]   the story of the fight is part of it,
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.360]   because he doesn't just shit talk.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.520]   This is what people don't seem to understand.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.320]   He's good at shit talking.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.080]   - Very good, and I'm with you
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.440]   on basically everything you said.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.080]   I think that there's greatness to that,
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.960]   and I think that he understands how to sell a fight,
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.840]   and I think
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.680]   what he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:07.000]   helped him win that fight.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.200]   He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.400]   that he knew Aldo was gonna come forward
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:15.720]   right into that left hook.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.440]   Was that fight in Brazil, by the way?
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:18.280]   Do you remember?
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.120]   - I don't recall.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.560]   - 'Cause I know he insulted all of Brazil,
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.480]   but I'm not sure if it was in Brazil.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.960]   - But when he tried to do that to Khabib,
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.440]   you could tell that he just was not gonna get
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.280]   in Khabib's head.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.840]   Khabib was unflappable.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.800]   But there is definitely something great
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:32.760]   about how he moves people.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.360]   The Irish are,
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.720]   Conor's walkout music,
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:41.280]   for people from Ireland of Irish descent,
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.600]   that shit is very deep.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:47.760]   It's a very emotional song.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.520]   - I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:54.200]   that he didn't rise,
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:56.800]   I admire that entire culture,
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.320]   but there's an aspect to where he could have risen
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.400]   to the occasion of,
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.400]   there's the same kind of depth of love of country
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.320]   that Russia has.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:11.800]   - Is there in Dagestan?
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:15.080]   - Dagestan is a little weird in the terms of like,
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.360]   but he could have, especially with Putin's support,
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:22.240]   wear for a bit the full Russian hat
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.000]   of like, this is the great nation,
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.280]   like rise above the culture of Dagestan,
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.120]   which is a small town boy with small town values,
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.120]   a family and all those kinds of things.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.640]   There's a moment where you inspire entire nations,
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:40.360]   like the step up and be the foil
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.400]   to the great Conor McGregor,
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:47.560]   where also Khabib becomes the foil too,
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.760]   like both of them are the foil to each other
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:54.520]   and become like, that fight was already a great fight,
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.080]   but it could have been something historic,
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:00.360]   Ali versus, I mean, it could have been really historic.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.820]   And I would argue,
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:05.640]   I guess the biggest disappointment I have,
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.640]   and I understand it,
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:08.720]   and I also honor it as a martial artist,
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:13.320]   but I'm disappointed that Khabib doesn't seem
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.680]   to even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:19.800]   fight number two.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:25.080]   'Cause that could be narrative wise, if they do it right,
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.120]   that's one of the,
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.440]   could be one of the greatest fights in history.
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:34.440]   - Yeah, I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country,
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:39.760]   is it possible that by staying true to the values
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:41.560]   that he had his entire career
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:46.560]   and getting to the zenith of his art form
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:49.120]   and still doing it in that humble way,
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:50.920]   isn't it possible that that inspires?
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:51.880]   - Yeah, 100%.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.040]   So I should clarify that I think
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.880]   they're just hearing from people,
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:59.680]   from my fellow comrades, no,
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:03.520]   they love that, they love that.
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:05.280]   But they-
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.440]   - There's also a brash beer chugging, shit talking thing
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:11.160]   that people really like about Conor.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.520]   And I do love that.
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:15.320]   - But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash,
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.240]   the real clash of those cultures.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:22.240]   So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:26.320]   There's also like a clash of them,
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:29.160]   sort of walking, not walking away from the fire,
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:32.640]   but walking into the fire of this,
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:33.760]   of this brashness.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:34.900]   It's the sort of,
[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:41.620]   the cool collected, like calmness of the Dagestan people.
[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:43.720]   - It's like you were talking about the Saitia brothers.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:46.560]   So they just view it totally differently.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:50.120]   And there are stereotypes about the Irish
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.800]   where they're maybe potentially a louder,
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:54.640]   more boisterous culture.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:55.480]   (Lex laughing)
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.400]   - I haven't heard of that, yeah.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.720]   - And I mean, I thought they each played
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:01.700]   their part perfectly.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.760]   And all those things that you're describing
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:05.600]   could have happened.
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:08.320]   Maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag,
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.940]   so to speak, for a nation of people and they go to battle.
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:12.720]   But the fight, if it plays out the same way,
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.960]   is still the fight.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.520]   And it was an okay fight.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.920]   It wasn't a great fight.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.160]   It was, you know, the fight was okay.
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:26.080]   And I think that, again, I don't have any idea
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:28.800]   what Khabib's obligations to his family are.
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:31.820]   I don't think either of those guys, you know,
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:34.120]   is want for more money.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:38.000]   To do another fight is just a legacy thing.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000]   It's just about, you know, fulfilling some part of a legacy.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.200]   - And I just, I admire the possibility of a great legacy
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.860]   that is bigger than either of the fighters.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:55.060]   I think with Khabib, he kind of,
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:57.420]   he's not as concerned about legacy, I think.
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:58.260]   - Right.
[02:07:58.260 --> 02:07:59.100]   - As--
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:00.340]   - But you're a promoter's dream,
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.900]   because you want the rematch.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.220]   And the only thing that makes more money
[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:05.540]   than the rematch is the trilogy.
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.020]   You gotta split the rematch, you hope Conor wins,
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:10.500]   and then you have the trilogy fight.
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:11.820]   And now you're all in.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:13.020]   - Yeah.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:15.340]   Yeah, I can't get into Khabib's head,
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:19.380]   but I know Putin, just the game, the entirety of it,
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:20.340]   especially at the time,
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:22.340]   especially if it was Trump as president,
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:26.420]   if he was as president at the time,
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:30.260]   and Putin, and in Russia,
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:35.260]   and just knowing how masterful Conor is at like,
[02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:37.420]   'cause Conor would be a different Conor.
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:39.060]   I think he would be a calmer Conor.
[02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:40.660]   Like there would be a different,
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:43.780]   'cause you don't wanna be over the top Conor
[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:44.820]   with the Russian people.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.260]   - Right, no, that's--
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.500]   - It's like, it's a dangerous ground.
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:49.860]   - When Kyle fought to beat,
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:52.900]   that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn.
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:53.740]   - Yeah.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:58.420]   - And then some of the Russian guys confronted Artem,
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.140]   and then Conor came over.
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:02.500]   - It's not, but the danger of that,
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:05.940]   I mean, there's the element of just like real danger,
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:08.340]   and the real, it was almost of war.
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.340]   It's, I don't know, it's--
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:14.940]   - It was like when Chael Sonnen was talking so much smack,
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:17.340]   maybe it was against Vanderlei Silva.
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.900]   I don't know, and it was one of those fights
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:19.740]   where they just didn't think
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:20.900]   he was gonna make it out of Brazil.
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:21.740]   - Yeah.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:22.860]   - Yeah.
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:24.460]   - Americans don't get it.
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:25.300]   - Yeah.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:26.340]   - People take some of that shit
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.540]   in different parts of the world very, very seriously.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:31.380]   - Yeah, but that's what makes it beautiful.
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.700]   That's what makes a great story,
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:35.580]   and I think fighting is very much about the stories,
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:39.660]   not just about the particular outcomes of a fight,
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:43.780]   or the skillset matching, or the chess of the fight.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:47.420]   It's also about the story of the greater
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:51.700]   context of societies, of warring.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.180]   We're like warring cultures.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.020]   We're still, we're still good,
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:59.340]   we're no longer can have great, big, hot wars
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:03.060]   between nations because of nuclear weapons.
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:05.460]   This is our wars that we can have,
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:08.660]   and in some sense I feel robbed
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:10.980]   of the great war that could have happened.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:13.740]   - It doesn't mean there aren't lots of wars going on,
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.060]   but yeah, the big one is not gonna happen.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.300]   There's too much of a balance of power
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:20.180]   with nuclear weapons and technology and stuff,
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:23.140]   but it's not the end of war.
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:24.180]   - No.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:26.940]   Do you think there's always gonna be war?
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:28.340]   - I think there'll always be war,
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:30.740]   especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:33.300]   - Isn't there always underdeveloped
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.340]   relatively parts of the world?
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.660]   - Yeah, I mean at some point though,
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:40.740]   you'd think, I mean the way that technology's expanding
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:43.380]   and we're bringing technology to weird parts of the world
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:47.900]   that you wouldn't think of as technologically advanced
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:51.460]   the way that the Chinese are inhabiting certain areas
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:54.300]   for mining purposes and things like that.
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:57.300]   I think underdeveloped parts of the world
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:59.500]   will get developed quickly.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:02.020]   - I just wonder what the nature of that war might be.
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.260]   It could be cyber, it could be all those kinds of things.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:06.340]   - I think in developed nations it's gonna be cyber.
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.260]   I think that's probably the next phase of war,
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.980]   but I mean I think you talk about parts of the world
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:11.780]   like the Middle East, and it's just still gonna be
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:13.540]   warring tribal factions.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.340]   We can't even begin to understand
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.580]   what those people are fighting about over there,
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:20.140]   yet everyone sitting in America on their couch
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:21.060]   has an opinion.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:24.220]   You can't even begin to understand it.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:25.540]   I sure can't.
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:27.860]   - Yeah, it's back to the principles discussion
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:31.380]   when what's violated is much deeper
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:34.380]   than just kind of anything we can even,
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:38.420]   in a middle class existence can even comprehend.
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:40.380]   - A lot of times American soldiers will go to war
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:41.660]   because that's what they're told to do,
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.420]   and maybe they disagree with the orders,
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:44.580]   and maybe they agree with the orders,
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:47.540]   but I get a sense that people in the Middle East fighting
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:49.900]   all believe in what they're fighting for.
[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:53.060]   It's not a thing where they're told to go do it.
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:56.740]   I believe they really believe that what they're doing
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:58.060]   is the right thing, and they're defending
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:59.940]   some sort of principle.
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:03.740]   - Are you generally optimistic about the future,
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:05.660]   speaking of war, of human civilization?
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:07.260]   Do you think we'll,
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:13.740]   people talk about the Fermi Paradox,
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:17.020]   and asking why haven't aliens visited us,
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:19.180]   if you believe they haven't visited us.
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:25.340]   One of the thoughts is that there's a kind of a great filter
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:29.220]   that intelligent civilization reach a point
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:31.180]   where it destroys itself naturally,
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:32.420]   so that's why we haven't seen them.
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:34.320]   They don't last very long.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.580]   There does seem to be a kind of,
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:39.700]   we seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster.
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.660]   We keep developing more and more powerful ways
[02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.060]   of destroying ourselves in all kinds of ways,
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:48.820]   not even, just even to say nuclear weapons alone,
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.940]   but there's all kinds of new ways,
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:55.940]   engineered pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI,
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.400]   all those kinds of things.
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.900]   It seems to be that the argument that we,
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:07.780]   are we going to destroy ourselves
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:10.740]   in some kind of creative way very shortly
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:13.860]   is not too crazy of an argument to make.
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:16.820]   - Are you more optimistic or pessimistic
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.940]   about the prospects of human civilization
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:21.380]   in maybe the 22nd century?
[02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:23.740]   Like is it possible that your generation
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:26.420]   is the last generation to be alive on Earth?
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:29.300]   - No, but I wouldn't say that five generations from now,
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.200]   that won't be, that could be true.
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:34.380]   I guess I think of it really selfishly.
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:38.320]   I'm a big believer that when your time here on Earth is over,
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:42.380]   the overwhelmingly vast majority of people
[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:44.860]   will be forgotten within 12 calendar months.
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.820]   The people with no family will be forgotten sooner.
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:49.340]   And so I don't give a lot of thought
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:52.420]   to what will happen to Earth or mankind when I'm gone.
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:55.940]   I give more thought to maximizing my time here now.
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:59.540]   And I wanna do it in a way where I don't,
[02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:03.780]   I'm not overtly hindering the future
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:05.900]   of civilization or humankind,
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:09.140]   but I'm definitely taking a me first approach
[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:10.780]   to how I live on Earth.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:13.500]   - Do you have a philosophy behind why you have
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.700]   or don't have kids on this topic?
[02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:18.940]   Because for many people, when they have kids,
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:23.940]   there's a sense, it's almost like a genetic sense
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:26.420]   or something like that, where all of a sudden
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:28.220]   you do start caring about what happens
[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:29.540]   five generations from now.
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:32.940]   - I mean, I think I'm just too selfish.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.620]   I mean, I think that's the easy answer.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:40.440]   Like I know that your whole life has to change.
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:43.740]   You know, your focus, everything shifts
[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.940]   and just don't wanna do that.
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.460]   And also, I think that there's a level of,
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:51.500]   I guess if I have to really unpack it,
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:56.500]   there's probably a level of lack of hope in the future.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:59.980]   I don't think the world and humanity
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:01.580]   is going in the right direction.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:04.780]   - What does the right direction look like?
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:08.500]   - I think the right direction looks like people
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:13.500]   coming back together in a more impactful human way,
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:20.040]   in person, touching, feeling, talking face to face.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:23.160]   - So all the things you're describing is what we had,
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:25.500]   as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager.
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.080]   - Yeah. - So the state of the world.
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.200]   But that's because your mind was formed then.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.080]   - It very well could be.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:32.040]   It very well could be.
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.160]   - It's very possible that the virtual reality worlds
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.960]   that we'll create will be actually
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.760]   a much higher level of existence.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:42.760]   In fact, now we're moving slowly away from tribalism.
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:46.240]   Perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations.
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:49.760]   And we're moving into the realm of ideas.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.640]   And it could be a higher form of existence
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:56.040]   where we're sort of moving past the constraints
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:59.520]   of our meat vehicles into the space of our minds.
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:00.720]   - It depends what you value.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:02.720]   'Cause when you sit here and you talk about it,
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:04.120]   and you're talking about these things
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:07.240]   on these humongous levels, on these macro levels.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:09.080]   And I don't think a lot of people view it that way.
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:10.760]   I think a lot of people view it as like,
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:12.640]   what kind of pizza am I getting tonight?
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:14.760]   Like it's a much different outlook.
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.760]   And sure, the virtual world that's on the horizon,
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:22.820]   I'm sure it's got benefits and will help people.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:25.280]   But is it gonna help the things that you find valuable?
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.800]   Like, is it gonna help commerce?
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:27.640]   Okay, sure.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.360]   Is that the thing you find the most valuable?
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:31.240]   Is it gonna help communication?
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.400]   Well, it'll help disseminating information.
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.320]   Is it gonna help explain the information
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.140]   you're disseminating?
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:37.320]   Probably not.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.600]   Is it gonna hinder interpersonal communication?
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:40.440]   Absolutely.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.280]   And those are things I find valuable.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:45.120]   Interpersonal communication, talking to people.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:49.080]   It saddens me when I go into a restaurant
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.880]   and there's five-year-old kids who like,
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.200]   slamming away on an iPad
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.020]   and can't make eye contact with anybody.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:56.300]   Or teenagers who don't say please and thank you
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:58.000]   when they order from the waitress.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.480]   That to me is wrong.
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:00.680]   That shit's wrong.
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:02.520]   And I don't know this for a fact,
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:06.660]   but I do attribute that to using technology as a crutch
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:08.460]   when we're raising kids.
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:13.620]   I think those are things that I find valuable.
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.580]   - I tried to empathize.
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.140]   I mean, I agree with you as a person
[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:17.220]   who grew up in a certain age,
[02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.880]   but prior to the internet, I suppose.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.980]   But, or at least solidified the early philosophies
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.660]   of the way I see the world prior to the internet.
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:31.440]   During the time of AOL, let's put it this way.
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:33.220]   (imitates burping)
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:35.140]   (laughing)
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:36.700]   What was your aim screen name?
[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:37.540]   - I never had one.
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:38.360]   - Okay.
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.860]   - Dude, I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone.
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:42.860]   I was so anti all that stuff
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:46.540]   because I just felt like I didn't wanna be a part of it.
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:47.660]   I did not wanna be a part of it.
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:52.220]   I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001
[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:53.720]   when I first started training.
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.220]   I think right at the tail end, I got a MySpace,
[02:17:57.220 --> 02:17:58.380]   but I didn't have any of that stuff
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:17:59.780]   and I didn't want any of it.
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:00.660]   I don't know why.
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:03.680]   I just was not into it.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:06.820]   I felt like, what are the good things
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:08.140]   that are gonna come out of it?
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:11.220]   I'm gonna get my package in two days instead of four days?
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:12.900]   Does that make my life better?
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:15.260]   - I try to deeply empathize
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:17.020]   with a lot of experiences of other people.
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.940]   And one of the things I love,
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.260]   like the smell of paper books and books in general.
[02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:24.720]   And early on, this is like five years ago,
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:27.140]   I just gave away all my books.
[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:29.100]   And I said, "I'm really going to try
[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:32.020]   "to fall in love with the books
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:35.100]   "in the same way I did before, but now with a Kindle."
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:37.580]   Or not a Kindle, like paper, white, whatever.
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:40.420]   The e-book reader. - E-reader.
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:42.580]   - And I'm still not there,
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:46.860]   but I've been trying to fall in love with that experience.
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:48.300]   And the same way I try to think
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:50.820]   like teenagers are really into TikTok now,
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.380]   like making these short videos,
[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:55.220]   I try to consider the possibility
[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:57.420]   that their existence will be a much happier one
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:01.060]   than I've had because of this kind of interaction.
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:02.980]   From my sort of skeptical perspective,
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:05.500]   it's like the attention span is so short,
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:08.940]   they don't really deeply think or deeply experience things.
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:11.820]   They construct a social layer
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:13.540]   that they present to the world.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:16.000]   And they work on creating this social layer,
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.180]   like the presentation to the world,
[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:20.100]   much more than really sitting alone
[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.720]   with their thoughts and the sadnesses
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:23.820]   and their hopes and dreams and fears.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:26.020]   And like working on the project
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:29.740]   that is their own actual person
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:31.300]   that exists in this physical world,
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:32.740]   as opposed to working on the project
[02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:35.820]   of a particular social platform that they show.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:38.300]   But like perhaps that project,
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:42.020]   like who cares who you are in the physical space?
[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:46.060]   Maybe what you are is what your Instagram shows.
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.100]   That's the more important project to work on.
[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:49.940]   - Well, what's reality? - Yeah, what's reality?
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.260]   - Perception is reality, right?
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.740]   So how other people perceive this constructed thing,
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.460]   that's their reality of you.
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:58.020]   But is it your reality?
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.460]   I mean, like we said earlier,
[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:03.340]   how you want people to see you
[02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:06.620]   is very rarely in line with how you really are
[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:08.580]   or how you see yourself.
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:11.620]   And I mean, I can remember being like a 13-year-old kid
[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:13.300]   and like when you go through a bunch of
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:14.900]   weird 13-year-old kid shit,
[02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:18.280]   like sitting in my room, like turning a red light on
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.260]   and listening to like a sad record
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:23.340]   and like trying to figure out what's going on inside.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.420]   Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't like it.
[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:28.020]   But I feel like those experiences are lost
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:29.900]   on kids constantly connected to a phone.
[02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:32.020]   And like, I don't know what the remedy
[02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:33.860]   for those situations is nowadays.
[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:35.500]   Like, I don't know, do they make a TikTok video?
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.180]   Do they blog about it?
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.460]   Do they make a video or a--
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:40.760]   - Nobody blogs anymore, bro.
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:41.860]   - Whatever, man.
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:46.020]   Or a video, a story about,
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:48.500]   oh, this is what happened to me and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:50.580]   Does that actually help them work it out?
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:52.680]   Or does it just create more noise and more static
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:54.340]   on how to get to the root of the problem
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:55.820]   and learn about themselves?
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:58.580]   - I don't know what future social networks are exactly.
[02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:00.460]   I do know on a shallow level,
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:03.140]   it does feel good when somebody clicks like on something.
[02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:05.140]   I think that is more of a drug
[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:09.100]   than an actual deep, long-lasting, fulfilling happiness.
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.180]   But perhaps there's a way to make a social network
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:14.260]   that does lead to long-lasting happiness
[02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:18.260]   that's somehow detached from the physical meat space.
[02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:19.940]   I don't know, but it feels like
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:21.780]   you want to give that a chance.
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:25.940]   - Do you think when people are liking things on social media,
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:27.840]   do you think there's just a group of people,
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.200]   an overwhelming majority of people
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:30.920]   that are gonna like whatever you put out there,
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.020]   they're clicking like,
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:33.520]   and then there's another section of people
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:35.480]   that just constantly scroll and like,
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.760]   scroll and like, and scroll and like.
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:42.760]   Do you think when you get a like on content you put out,
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:45.040]   that that like perhaps came from someone
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.220]   who normally doesn't like your content,
[02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:50.760]   but you've just changed their mind on something,
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.740]   or you've turned them around on it?
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:55.380]   I tend to think that when I get likes on social media,
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:56.920]   those are just the people that like all my shit
[02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:58.220]   no matter what I say.
[02:21:58.220 --> 02:21:59.360]   They probably don't even read it.
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:02.140]   I could put the most preposterous thing up there,
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:04.340]   and you're still gonna get a handful of the same exact likes.
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.180]   - That's interesting.
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:07.880]   But I tend to, the way I see likes,
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:10.040]   you said multiple things.
[02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:13.660]   I think in one sense you see social media
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:15.700]   as a battleground of ideas,
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:17.700]   and like is a kind of indicator,
[02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:20.240]   the best possible like is an indicator of like,
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:25.060]   of you winning over somebody on an idea,
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:26.380]   and they really appreciate that idea.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.780]   That's the best possible like.
[02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:31.780]   To me, a like is just two strangers smiling at each other,
[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:33.660]   like a moment of like.
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:36.300]   - I got you, bro.
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:37.340]   - Yeah, I got you, bro.
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:38.180]   - Yeah.
[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:40.400]   - Yeah, like fist bump, like yeah,
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:42.180]   we're in this fucking thing together.
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:43.620]   This whole thing doesn't make any sense,
[02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:44.860]   but we're in this together.
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:46.660]   - I think--
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:48.780]   - Yeah, it's possible for likes to be that.
[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:51.820]   I don't think the actual clicking of a like.
[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:54.540]   I think social media at its best might be that,
[02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:59.540]   where it's like, I got you, bro, at a large scale,
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:03.140]   as opposed to kind of this weird,
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:07.420]   crazy pool of dopamine where everyone's just obsessed
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:09.060]   with just likes and likes,
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.900]   and then the division drives more of this weird,
[02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:16.180]   anxious engagement.
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:18.180]   I think that's just the dark version of it
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:19.860]   in the early days of social media.
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:22.740]   - I think you called it a battleground of ideas,
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.020]   but I think social media is nothing
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:26.080]   but a battleground of fragile egos.
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.900]   - Well, but humans are fragile egos.
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:33.220]   - I mean, maybe, but I think the people,
[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:35.220]   I think particularly on social media,
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:36.760]   they're the most fragile.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:41.660]   Would you be doing all the things you're doing,
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:43.660]   what would you be doing if you weren't,
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:50.100]   if you weren't podcasting and posting the things you do
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:52.500]   on social media, what would you be doing?
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:55.720]   You'd probably be much the same guy, right?
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:59.980]   But I think that on social media, the fragile ego people,
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:02.300]   what you see on social media is not what they'd be doing
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.620]   without social media.
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:04.940]   Does that make any sense?
[02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:07.140]   You're probably, your mission is probably
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.500]   somewhat congruent, your path.
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:10.960]   You're just utilizing social media,
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:12.600]   but I think a lot of people,
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.540]   social media has changed their path
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:19.540]   and now they're doing something totally foreign to them
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:22.180]   and they're only able to do it
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:23.500]   maybe because of social media.
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:27.140]   - I think you're focusing on a particular moment in time
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:31.580]   of people in their less great moments,
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:34.140]   like in their less great version of themselves.
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:37.060]   I think you're just focusing on the masses struggling
[02:24:37.060 --> 02:24:39.900]   to become the best version of themselves
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:41.940]   and then you, yeah, sure.
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:45.660]   For stretches of time, whether it's days, weeks, or months,
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:47.620]   you could be a shitty person on the internet.
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:51.500]   I think you're focusing on that
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:56.220]   and unfortunately, social media platforms emphasize
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.220]   they love it when you're like that,
[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:01.380]   when you're not doing great in your own life
[02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:04.940]   because it increases anxiety, increases engagement,
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:07.300]   makes you more susceptible to an argument
[02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:09.640]   and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories,
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:11.300]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:12.620]   - But the other side works too.
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:14.580]   I think there's also the people who are on social media
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.500]   like fronting like they're these positive figures
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:20.500]   and like, you know, go into the gym,
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:23.240]   like whatever it is, the positivity that they spew out,
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:24.940]   but in real life, they're the most negative fucks
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:25.980]   you've ever met in your life
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:27.620]   and they're just so full of crap
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:30.180]   and it's just people playing to an audience.
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:33.820]   It's like you said, it's like a politician sometimes.
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.820]   Like a politician wakes up one day and they decide,
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:38.240]   who's the group I can pander to the best
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.580]   to get the most likes equals votes?
[02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:42.060]   And it's the same thing on social media.
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:45.100]   People wake up and whether it's conscious or not,
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:47.560]   what's the group I can pander to the best
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:48.740]   to get the most likes?
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:50.820]   Is it the positivity motivated crowd?
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:52.460]   Is it the woe is me crowd?
[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:53.300]   Like what is it?
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:54.780]   Who's gonna give me the most likes?
[02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:55.840]   That's what I'll do.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.180]   - I don't know how to argue against that.
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:03.580]   It rings true what you're saying,
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.540]   but I just kind of refuse to believe it.
[02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:08.560]   I guess I'm pandering to the optimistic crowd.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:10.600]   Like I met with my marketing team
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.600]   and I just feel that love has the best,
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.640]   what do you call it?
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:18.460]   No, I don't know.
[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:19.560]   There's a lot of people that accuse me
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.160]   of being like exactly that,
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.840]   which is like, why are you always being positive?
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:26.640]   It's like, well, 'cause I'd like to be that.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:30.040]   - Yeah, but I wouldn't consider you someone who panders.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:33.340]   - No, but I guess what I'm saying is like,
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.840]   it's easy to say that everyone is pandering,
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.480]   but like maybe they're just trying.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:44.820]   I do believe that social media platforms
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:46.220]   could encourage people when they're trying
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:48.320]   to be the best version of themselves, whatever that is.
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.600]   It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:52.160]   It could be just being positive.
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.380]   It could be actually creating cool things in this world,
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.440]   putting out instructional videos for jujitsu
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:59.840]   or like inspiring students to competition.
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.280]   I don't know, all those kinds of things, educational content.
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.040]   I think that people are trying.
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.560]   Like I tend to believe that people want to be good.
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:12.720]   They want to be successful
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:14.300]   in whatever their definition of success is.
[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:15.920]   And they're kind of struggling to do that.
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:18.320]   And they're just awkward at it at first.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:21.160]   And like, it's easy to focus on the awkwardness
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:24.000]   and the stumbling around as people have that.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.480]   And they start shitting on each other.
[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:27.340]   It's easy to kind of focus in on that.
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:30.760]   But I think that's just like people, white belts.
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.000]   There's more white belts in the world
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:32.880]   than there are black belts.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:34.920]   But you gotta give them a chance to kind of grow.
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:37.080]   - I think on social media, if you put your stuff out there,
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:38.600]   whatever your stuff is, your content,
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:40.760]   your views or whatever, you let the chips fall
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:43.200]   where they may, like that's a different thing
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:46.880]   than being like, I'm gonna tweak what I normally might say
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:48.360]   and put it up this way because I want
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:50.240]   these people to like it.
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:54.360]   And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:56.760]   than you do on people wanting to be successful.
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:58.280]   I actually don't think that many people
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:27:59.840]   want to be successful.
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:02.120]   I think people want to have the appearance
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:04.040]   of wanting to be successful.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.640]   But to be successful takes a shitload of work.
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:08.600]   And most people don't want to put that work in.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.000]   So they craft this persona of a person
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.720]   who's trying really hard but just can't catch the break
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.400]   or these motherfuckers with getting back on my grind.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:19.720]   You've never been on a grind.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:20.960]   You've been on the couch.
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.120]   - I so disagree with you.
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:24.400]   I get it, I get it.
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:25.260]   That's your foil.
[02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:27.660]   You enjoy that guy on the couch with the cheetah.
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:29.880]   That's your motivation.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.720]   - But just own it.
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:32.640]   Don't be like back on the grind,
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:33.960]   be like back on the couch.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:36.720]   - Yeah, well, you're like David Goggins
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:38.200]   who was like talking shit to the one guy
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.160]   with the eating Cheetos.
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:42.240]   And in so doing inspires millions
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:44.640]   to actually pursue their success.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:45.480]   I get it.
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:46.560]   But I just think that most people
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:48.880]   really do want to be successful
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:52.340]   and are trying to work hard and they keep failing.
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:55.920]   - But why is it continue?
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:57.040]   I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:59.320]   But let's take a person who's overweight.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:01.440]   Do you not think that person wants to be skinny?
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.000]   Of course they want to be skinny.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.840]   They just don't want it enough
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:07.720]   to put the pizza or the pie down and go to the gym.
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:10.220]   They want it, but they want it to be easy.
[02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:11.760]   Of course they want to be skinny.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:13.160]   - Well, everyone wants it to be easy.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:16.160]   - Right, and of course people want to be successful,
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.680]   but do they want it enough to do the work?
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:20.000]   I don't think they do.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.880]   I think the easy thing to do is to create
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:28.820]   an outward facing persona of the person who really wants it.
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:32.840]   And you get the same reward from a lot of people
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:35.200]   as the person who actually is successful.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:36.700]   Very few people differentiate
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:38.480]   from the person who's found success
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:40.480]   and the person who's showing you
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:43.120]   how they're trying to get success on social media.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.960]   People see that as the same.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.800]   - I see you're going after the marketing dollar
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:50.520]   that represents the people that want to work hard.
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.800]   - Yeah.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:52.640]   - I like it.
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:57.680]   You started a podcast recently.
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.520]   - Hell yeah.
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:02.740]   - Called, which people probably from this conversation can,
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:05.100]   oh, I guess we didn't really talk about politics much,
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:06.500]   or the fact that you're a business owner,
[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.940]   or the fact that you're a red-blooded American
[02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:12.660]   and love this country, America.
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.020]   We didn't really talk about that,
[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.620]   but from the name of the podcast,
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:16.740]   they can probably infer it,
[02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:20.540]   and the name is Please Allow Me.
[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:21.380]   Good name.
[02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:27.620]   What have you learned from doing this podcast?
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:30.420]   What's your hope of doing this podcast?
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:31.700]   People should definitely listen to it.
[02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:32.920]   You have a few episodes out.
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:36.380]   You're damn good at it, which is very interesting.
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:38.820]   I'm sure you'll evolve and change.
[02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:40.180]   So this is like the early days.
[02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:41.900]   I'm curious to see where it goes.
[02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:44.780]   But what's your thinking around it
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:48.900]   as an intellectual putting your thoughts out into the world?
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:52.380]   - I think that one of the things that COVID did
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:54.420]   when we were all kind of in lockdown was,
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:57.000]   as a business owner, it made me take stock
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.600]   of what's the future of brick and mortar businesses.
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:03.940]   I've always been reluctant to be an online presence
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:05.660]   in any way just 'cause it's not my thing,
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.220]   because I believe that I'm a force of nature
[02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:08.860]   and people need to experience me.
[02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:13.140]   - And the few characters that Twitter has,
[02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:13.980]   it's not enough to experience.
[02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:15.180]   - It's not enough.
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:17.060]   - The force of nature, there's John Clark.
[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:19.900]   - I want you to feel physically uncomfortable around me.
[02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:21.220]   - This has been three hours
[02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:23.420]   of me being physically uncomfortable.
[02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:25.180]   I'm scared for my life.
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.560]   And so I thought that that would be one of the ways
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:29.240]   in which I could increase.
[02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:33.240]   I came to the conclusion that with the lockdown
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:34.800]   and potential future lockdowns,
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:40.000]   in order to pay my mortgage and my bar tab
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.280]   and my Grubhub's out of control,
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:45.520]   that I would need to find ancillary ways to--
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.560]   - DoorDash/Lex.
[02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:48.880]   You don't wanna use Grubhub.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:49.840]   Grubhub sucks.
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.080]   DoorDash. - They actually do suck.
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:51.920]   - DoorDash.
[02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:52.740]   No, I'm just kidding.
[02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:55.400]   Just walk to your local foodery.
[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:56.240]   - 7-Eleven.
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.600]   - Yeah, and get the food.
[02:31:57.600 --> 02:31:59.600]   - You can order 7-Eleven from DoorDash.
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:00.640]   - Or from Postmates.
[02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:01.600]   - Code Lex.
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:03.560]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:05.600]   - But anyway, I thought it was like,
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:07.480]   oh, I should probably increase a little bit
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:12.200]   my online presence and what would be a way to do that
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:15.040]   that would be fun for me and entertaining.
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:17.920]   And I thought, well, a lot of people,
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:20.560]   yourself included that I know have done some podcasts
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:23.260]   and I find that inspiring.
[02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:24.900]   And I'm fortunate enough to know a bunch
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.940]   of cool motherfuckers that I can talk to
[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:31.220]   about a wide range of topics.
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:32.500]   - Then there is, sorry to drop in,
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:34.660]   there's an aspect to which podcasting does capture
[02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:36.660]   the force of nature better.
[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:39.700]   In the digital form, podcasting captures the force
[02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:41.180]   of nature of a human being better
[02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:42.460]   than other mediums, perhaps.
[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:43.860]   - Yeah, definitely, there's that.
[02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:48.620]   I just felt like, you know when it's midnight
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:51.720]   and you're in the bar and you get the sense
[02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:53.760]   that the bar's gonna close in 90 minutes
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.000]   and you think, you know, not enough people have seen me yet.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.240]   And maybe we should go to another bar
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.080]   so more people can see me.
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:03.760]   I feel like podcasting is like that for me.
[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:05.680]   Not enough people have heard my thoughts
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:08.840]   and I feel like, my mom raised me to be a giver.
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:10.840]   She didn't want me to be selfish.
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:15.120]   And I have these thoughts that I think--
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.040]   - It'd be a waste if you didn't give it to the world.
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:18.620]   - People seem to really enjoy them.
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:20.740]   - Yeah, no, I enjoy them.
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:23.380]   - While I've probably been on my best behavior today
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:25.740]   on this episode of the podcast.
[02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:29.880]   - So if you want the uncensored, unfiltered,
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:33.320]   the full spectrum, the force of nature, there's John Clark.
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:35.700]   You go to the podcast.
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:38.000]   Funny enough, I think you're drinking
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.460]   throughout most of the podcast.
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:40.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:42.980]   - Tequila, so they only last like an hour
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:46.660]   'cause you seem to, I'm guessing that you just lose it
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:49.700]   in one hour, like it's like Cinderella turns into a frog
[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:50.540]   or whatever.
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:52.660]   - One of the things I'm learning is
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:57.700]   sometimes you have great conversations when you're drunk
[02:33:57.700 --> 02:33:58.620]   and sometimes you don't.
[02:33:58.620 --> 02:34:01.260]   Like I went into it with the write drunk,
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:02.640]   edit sober mentality.
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:05.140]   - Yes, Hemingway.
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:06.380]   - Hemingway, yes.
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:10.820]   But turns out that sometimes you don't have that much
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:13.140]   to edit when you're super shit-faced.
[02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:17.140]   And so I've been scaling that back a little bit.
[02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:18.900]   - What do you mean exactly by that?
[02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:20.460]   Where does it go wrong when you're drunk?
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:22.060]   I'm curious about that 'cause--
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:26.220]   - Especially when you have a personal relationship
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:27.820]   with the person that you're talking to,
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:29.900]   rather than trying to put some ideas on display
[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:32.060]   for other people to hear and maybe talk about,
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:34.260]   you wind up just having a conversation with your bro
[02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:36.100]   about inside jokes and things like that.
[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.820]   And it's not that interesting.
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:41.860]   No one wants to watch, go to a bar and watch two people
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:43.540]   at the, sitting there getting drunk
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.160]   and talking to each other is different
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:48.500]   than listening to like strong discourse.
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:49.340]   - Yes.
[02:34:49.340 --> 02:34:51.420]   One interesting thing as a fan of Joe Rogan,
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:53.500]   I'm a fan, I've been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:56.340]   and he has his friends over a lot, right?
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:59.020]   And there's a aspect to those three, four,
[02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:00.780]   five hour conversations that I really enjoy.
[02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:02.340]   There's a magic to those.
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:03.900]   I think he taught the world that those kinds
[02:35:03.900 --> 02:35:05.820]   of long form conversations can work.
[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:10.620]   What you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:12.420]   His friends are also celebrities.
[02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:14.820]   Like they know what it's like to be on the mic.
[02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:18.020]   They know there is a challenge to actually having
[02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:20.260]   your friends on a microphone.
[02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:21.100]   - Totally.
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:22.780]   - Like they've never, this is the first time
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.020]   they've been on a microphone.
[02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:25.540]   And that's actually what you've been doing,
[02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:28.020]   which is a very interesting experiment.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:31.880]   And you find that some are more awkward than others.
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:33.540]   Like they're trying to find like,
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.180]   what do I do with this kind of thing?
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:37.740]   Why do you not talk to strangers?
[02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:41.460]   Why did you go with people that you're actually know?
[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:43.920]   - So the simple answer is the people that I selected
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:46.660]   are both interesting and I thought would be good at talking.
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:48.780]   But then I noticed the thing you just mentioned.
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:51.580]   My buddy Paul did the first one and Paul's a wild man.
[02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:52.860]   And if you went out with Paul,
[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:56.060]   he can talk about a bazillion topics
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:36:00.220]   to a significant level of depth, right?
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:01.220]   And he's got a good understanding
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:03.860]   and he's got a unique perspective on a lot of things.
[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:10.140]   And I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:15.220]   and it was almost like he was on a little bit
[02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:16.900]   less than natural about it.
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:19.140]   And then by the time he loosened up with some drinks,
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:22.540]   he was, it just, we were all shit faced.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:24.100]   - There's a phase shift though.
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:25.460]   - Totally, totally.
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:27.780]   And so he's gonna come back on
[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:29.260]   and he'll be more comfortable with it.
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:31.020]   And it'll probably be awesome
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:33.500]   'cause he's a great person to talk to.
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:35.420]   I had my friend Dave on who's a restaurateur
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:39.260]   and a musician, that one will be released pretty soon.
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.740]   But yesterday I had a guy on
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:42.460]   who you might really enjoy listening to
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:44.620]   who's a friend of mine, his name is Mark Clem.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:48.500]   He's an endurance athlete and he's been compared,
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:51.060]   he's been called the white Dave Goggins.
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:53.860]   And he talks about like those comparisons
[02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:55.300]   and what he hates about it
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:56.980]   and the various events and stuff.
[02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:59.540]   And he's just a guy who's just always kind of like natural
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.900]   and like I knew he'd be great to get on the podcast.
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:06.900]   And so I started with friends who I thought could handle it
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:10.500]   and who also are just really interesting people.
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:13.980]   And I did it so that I could also establish
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:16.500]   a level of comfort because it was a new thing for me.
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:18.220]   And I knew that they wouldn't really give a shit
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:19.380]   what I was doing and be like,
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:21.060]   "Hey, this is cool, I'm going over to JC's house,
[02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:22.620]   "we're gonna drink some tequila and talk shit.
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:24.580]   "There's just gonna be a microphone there this time."
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:25.780]   - I mean, it's amazing what you're doing,
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:26.620]   the freedom of it.
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:28.580]   I mean, you're not currently doing any advertisements
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:29.420]   or any of that kind of stuff.
[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:30.500]   He's just exploring your voice
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:32.940]   as one of the mediums that you're just trying it out.
[02:37:32.940 --> 02:37:34.820]   - My 11 subscribers know what I'm about.
[02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:38.080]   - Your 11 subscribers, it's in the double digits.
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:45.020]   For both you and I, do you have advice for me as a podcaster
[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:46.660]   and for yourself as a podcaster?
[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:48.980]   Like if you were to think like you're gonna do,
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:50.580]   say, I mean, who knows,
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:53.580]   but say you do a thousand more episodes, right?
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:58.220]   Like imagine a world where your life continues
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:01.180]   in that direction, that this is like a little parallel.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:03.460]   Like for me, this thing is like a little side hobby,
[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:06.100]   but it's also one that's deeply fulfilling.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:09.080]   So not just from a business perspective,
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:10.500]   which is not the way I think about it,
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:13.100]   I just think from a life, human perspective.
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:16.200]   I probably wouldn't have this kind of conversation
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:20.900]   with you off mic, like this long, this deep, this attentive.
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:22.300]   There's something really fulfilling
[02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:23.660]   about these conversations.
[02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:26.380]   So what advice would you have for me?
[02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:28.060]   What advice do you have for yourself?
[02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:30.980]   Or have you not introspected this that deeply?
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:32.460]   - I have advice.
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:34.300]   I think the first advice I would give to you
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:37.140]   is I think you should have me on more often.
[02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:39.180]   (laughing)
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.020]   - Yeah.
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.180]   - That's first and foremost.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:43.940]   - And second is go on your podcast and have a conversation.
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:48.940]   - Well, I would say you come on my podcast when you're ready.
[02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:49.820]   - Yeah.
[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:52.940]   - When you feel like the product that I'm putting out
[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:57.020]   would benefit from your presence and vice versa.
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:01.700]   Not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:04.180]   - I do sense, actually, it's an interesting,
[02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:06.300]   there's a dance to it, which is,
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:12.140]   I recently did, Joe Rogan had a conversation with me
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:13.740]   on this podcast.
[02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:16.100]   There's a very specific kind of thing
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:20.060]   where you're helping each other out,
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:22.180]   but the timing on that has to be right.
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:24.900]   If that makes any sense.
[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:26.740]   You're supporting each other.
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:27.620]   It doesn't make sense.
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:30.700]   It doesn't make a difference, you would think.
[02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:31.540]   - Right.
[02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:32.740]   - 'Cause it's just people talking.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:34.140]   It doesn't matter what microphone.
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:35.300]   But it changes things.
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:36.900]   - It does, and there's an order to the guests
[02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:38.140]   that I've had on.
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:39.700]   And the next guest that I'll have on
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:42.660]   will be a friend we have in common,
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:44.220]   and we'll be talking about teaching,
[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:45.960]   and how to teach different styles of teaching,
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:47.500]   and what you're teaching, and all these other things.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:48.780]   - Do you mind saying who?
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:49.620]   - Sean Fisher.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:50.460]   - Okay.
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:53.120]   - And I think there's an order to,
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.760]   it's not scientific, but it's based on my gut.
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:58.900]   - Is it astrologically based?
[02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:02.520]   What do you mean it's not scientific?
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:05.440]   Your gut, so you have a sense.
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:09.560]   Like Joe Rogan, for example, tries to do left, right.
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:12.440]   He tries to alternate this gut feeling
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:14.520]   of these bins of people,
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:17.440]   and he tries to alternate world views.
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:18.800]   - That's interesting.
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:20.700]   - So that he doesn't feel like,
[02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:26.420]   it constantly shakes him, it's more about him,
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.840]   like constantly pulls him in multiple directions
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:31.280]   about how he sees the world,
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:32.780]   and that keeps him balanced.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:34.660]   That keeps the conversation kind of exciting.
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:35.480]   - That's interesting.
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.260]   I did it in a way where I knew Paul was gonna be wild,
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:40.680]   and we might get a little out of control,
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:43.680]   and have some technical hiccups along the way.
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.640]   And then my friend Jake,
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:47.060]   who's a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,
[02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:49.420]   that was very timely because he was able
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:50.260]   to speak to vaccines, and--
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:52.620]   - And it was kind of scientific flavored.
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:55.620]   - Yeah, and what I learned listening back on that
[02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:58.000]   is I learned for myself about,
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.140]   I wasn't asking the next level questions
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:04.340]   to really draw out great answers.
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:05.740]   And part of it is,
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:09.860]   you're simultaneously hanging out with a bro,
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:11.300]   but also I was trying to learn something,
[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:12.980]   and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn.
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:15.620]   And that's my fault, 'cause I didn't ask the questions.
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:17.340]   He's an expert in that field.
[02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:19.740]   He doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.980]   when it comes to that stuff.
[02:41:20.980 --> 02:41:22.120]   And so I didn't do a good job,
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:22.960]   and if I don't know it,
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:25.060]   that means the thing I was trying to tease out of him,
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:27.980]   no one who was gonna listen is gonna learn that either.
[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:28.980]   So I learned that.
[02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:31.820]   Then I had the one with soap on,
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:34.820]   which I thought was pretty good.
[02:41:34.820 --> 02:41:36.700]   - He's a wrestler, he's also a farmer.
[02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:38.620]   - Right, and he's a social worker.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:40.740]   - And kind of humble and-- - Thoughtful.
[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:42.460]   - Yeah, thoughtful. - Thoughtful guy.
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:45.180]   - Like slower, so not a wild man, that kind of thing.
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:46.980]   - Not a wild man in the sense that I'm wild,
[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:51.080]   but he does preach this philosophy of being more wild.
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:52.980]   Like being in touch with nature.
[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:55.860]   - Nature, that kind of wild. - Right, right, right.
[02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:58.660]   And then my buddy Dave, he came on,
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:01.620]   because I love music,
[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:03.260]   and I wanted to talk a lot about music,
[02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:05.220]   and he's one of the most knowledgeable people
[02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:06.420]   about music that I know,
[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:07.580]   and he's got a restaurant coming up.
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:11.140]   And I thought my buddy Mark Clem,
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:12.340]   being an endurance athlete,
[02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:13.500]   like when you hear some of the,
[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:14.940]   I didn't even know these things existed
[02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:16.220]   that this fucking kid did.
[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:17.740]   He's out of his mind.
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:19.740]   And I think Sean and I will have
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.740]   probably the most intellectual conversation
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:24.180]   that I'll have had on my podcast to date.
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:26.540]   And so there's a little bit of alternating there,
[02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:31.540]   but I did it that way so that--
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:34.740]   - There's a gut feeling behind, oh, so that what?
[02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:36.580]   Is there, where are you going?
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.180]   Do you know where you're going?
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:42.120]   - I don't have a destination, but I want to,
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:48.000]   I wanna see it to its end, whether that's,
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.640]   it gets somewhere of its own volition,
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:53.840]   or it takes on a new life at some point,
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:56.480]   and then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:02.740]   I think the advice I have for both of us is,
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:09.960]   I think I need to, no, I don't think so.
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:13.160]   I think for you, I see an inner turmoil.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:15.080]   I see a storm that bruising you
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:19.000]   because I feel like there's a concern for what you're saying
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000]   and is it gonna lead to negative feelings towards you
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.520]   or the thing that you're doing?
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.880]   And I feel like we're different people,
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:37.440]   and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.140]   And that's a liberating thing,
[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:43.580]   but it also can keep me from achieving the thing
[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:48.440]   that I want to achieve because I'm so flippant with opinions
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.640]   that I don't listen to them
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:51.280]   and let them direct me when they should.
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:52.380]   There's a balance.
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:54.760]   - Let me push back on that.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.600]   - Please do.
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:57.760]   - I think you believe that about yourself,
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:59.960]   and nevertheless, your social media presence
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:01.160]   indicates otherwise.
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:04.560]   If I were to be very harsh, you're one of the
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:07.440]   mentally strongest, character-wise people I know,
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:09.600]   and yet, on social media,
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:11.760]   don't put your face to the world.
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:13.000]   - No.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.840]   One of the reasons you sense the fear in me, which exists,
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:19.000]   I, of course, wanna let go of it,
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:23.480]   is because I put my face, my name on things,
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.760]   and so when I say something stupid,
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:29.920]   it hurts when people say,
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.240]   "Look, that guy said something stupid."
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:34.320]   And so there's a fear of saying something stupid
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:35.900]   in all of his different forms,
[02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:38.480]   of being my lesser self.
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:40.280]   It's the same feeling I have in competition
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.720]   of losing, not just losing, losing doesn't matter,
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:46.120]   it's embarrassing myself.
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:49.240]   I like losing, being the lesser version of myself,
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:51.000]   and when you put yourself out there in a full way,
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.040]   I think you, I would venture to say you're also,
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.440]   'cause you said you wouldn't give yourself that advice,
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.660]   I feel like you're also afraid of standing behind
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:02.240]   some of the ideas, 'cause right now,
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.560]   you're doing guerrilla warfare.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:08.560]   You're free to be, to say things,
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:11.840]   to speak your mind from the sidelines,
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:14.080]   but the moment you're standing,
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.360]   like when people can throw shit at you,
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.760]   I feel like you haven't faced that fire yet.
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:21.080]   You've been avoiding that fire.
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:23.060]   I'm not sure, maybe I'm projecting.
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:24.560]   - No, to a degree, you're right.
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.200]   I think a big thing for me was putting ads on,
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:33.120]   for our jujitsu online curriculum.
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.080]   That was a big thing for me,
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:37.160]   because for several reasons,
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:39.720]   like in the climate of everyone under the sun
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:43.400]   having a jujitsu tutorial online,
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:45.520]   and social media, not social media necessarily,
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:49.720]   but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed.
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:52.000]   One thing I have not done that I've thought about doing,
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.680]   and probably you're right in your analysis of it,
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:57.160]   is I've not gone the way that I do see you
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:58.800]   on things like Reddit and say,
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:00.440]   "Hey, Reddit, I'm doing this."
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:01.860]   Like I could easily go to Reddit and say,
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:04.560]   "Hey, Reddit, I got this website up.
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:05.840]   "Here's a sample video,"
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:07.200]   whatever the fuck people do on there.
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:08.720]   But yeah, you're right, I haven't done that.
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:13.720]   And part of it might be because I know also
[02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:18.960]   if I get suckered in for one second into the negativity,
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:20.760]   I'm gonna become an online warrior,
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:22.600]   and I don't wanna be that person.
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:24.000]   So yeah, you're probably right.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.320]   - So you're self-aware about that.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.180]   I mean, one of the things I've early on decided is like,
[02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:32.920]   I'm just gonna be, I've always really enjoyed being positive,
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.800]   so I'm going to make sure I stay that way.
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:37.800]   And when there's negativity, it's like,
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:40.360]   I'm not just ignoring it,
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:42.840]   I'm literally just returning it with positivity.
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:45.800]   I probably am the same way as you,
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:48.520]   most people are, with egos.
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:51.200]   You wanna become the warrior against the negativity.
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.040]   And like many wars, there's no winning.
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:56.880]   There's no winning that war.
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:57.920]   - Especially online.
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:46:59.080]   - Especially on the internet.
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:02.500]   And so in that sense, that's been a journey
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:07.500]   to try to face the fire of the negativity.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:08.760]   And it's not actually that bad,
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:09.960]   it sounds like very dramatic.
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:11.600]   There's not many people that are negative,
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:14.000]   but it's like when you put advertisements,
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.920]   so you put your face on an instructional
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:17.440]   or something like that.
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.360]   It just, there's an aspect to it
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.720]   which you're being a salesman,
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:23.400]   you're being a gimmicky thing.
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:26.200]   It just feels wrong, and people will point out,
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:27.980]   look, that guy's a fraud, look, he's fake,
[02:47:27.980 --> 02:47:29.280]   look, he's trying.
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:31.180]   But those people are going to be out there,
[02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:33.480]   and if you're trying to do your best,
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:36.760]   trying to be authentic, and not trying to be
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:41.760]   a snake oil salesman, and being the shady kind of salesman,
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:46.280]   I think they keep you honest.
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:49.120]   They keep you honest, being the most authentic self.
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.320]   And podcasting is the best medium,
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:53.340]   because you're being real.
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:56.720]   Those one hour plus that you put out there,
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:47:58.640]   that's real, John.
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:03.640]   That's not a, people fall in love with that,
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:06.420]   and that's the beautiful aspect of podcasting,
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.420]   is there's no, long form doesn't give any possibility
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:14.140]   for you not to be authentic.
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:14.980]   - Right.
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:16.700]   - And that's why it's a magical medium.
[02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:21.080]   The tough thing is you're not,
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:24.980]   popularity takes time, popularity.
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:27.860]   And so you shouldn't be doing it for that reason.
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:32.860]   And I don't, it's not the thing that really drives me.
[02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:34.620]   Yeah.
[02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:36.700]   - Is there three books, technical fiction,
[02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.460]   or philosophical, that had an impact on you?
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:40.260]   Like, is there books that you kind of return to
[02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:44.860]   that you enjoy, and that you find profound in some way?
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:46.940]   - I would say, probably the thing I read
[02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:49.180]   is in one of Emerson's essays that I read
[02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:52.900]   at a point in my life where I needed that type of thing.
[02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:56.440]   And I read Self Reliance, and he's got a ton of good essays,
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:58.140]   but I thought Self Reliance was probably
[02:48:58.140 --> 02:48:59.880]   the most impactful to me.
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:04.220]   I've read later in life, like a handful of,
[02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:09.020]   existential authors, and they're all great,
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:12.100]   but at the time, a lot of it has to do with timing.
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:14.020]   And when I read Self Reliance,
[02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:17.380]   and it was about the individual that was really good,
[02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:19.820]   and it was impactful.
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:22.720]   There's also a book called Jonathan Livingston Siegel,
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.300]   by Richard Bach, I think.
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:27.880]   And it's kind of along the same lines.
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:31.000]   It's about this Siegel who wants to break conformity,
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.560]   and learn to fly, and do all these other great things.
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.380]   And so it's a very short read.
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:37.540]   So if people are interested in that, that's good.
[02:49:37.540 --> 02:49:42.280]   The book, which I was lucky enough to read
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:44.220]   before the movie ever even came out,
[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:47.980]   which is just a pleasure of mine, was American Psycho.
[02:49:47.980 --> 02:49:49.620]   Just from a writing standpoint,
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:52.820]   I found that the writing was awesome.
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:54.380]   Brett Easton Ellis, who's the author of that,
[02:49:54.380 --> 02:49:57.540]   and several other books who have intertwining characters.
[02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:59.020]   He's a New England prep school guy.
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:00.680]   And so a lot of the stories,
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.420]   and a lot of the visuals rang true for me.
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:07.780]   And anyone who can write four pages of prose
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:10.480]   on a Huey Lewis album, kudos to you.
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:14.740]   And I also would say, no one will do this,
[02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:19.620]   but I would, at some point, read as much
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:23.180]   of one of the big three religious texts as possible.
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:25.500]   It really gives you perspective.
[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:30.300]   There's so many overlapping stories of religious texts,
[02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:31.780]   and then the way that they're written
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:33.700]   gives you a unique perspective
[02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:37.540]   on different people throughout the world.
[02:50:37.540 --> 02:50:42.500]   And if you're a Roman Catholic, maybe don't read the Bible.
[02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:43.660]   Read one of the other texts,
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:45.820]   and that would be an interesting take.
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:47.420]   - I'm embarrassed to say that, first of all,
[02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:50.540]   I've never read the Bible, which is embarrassing to say.
[02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.220]   It's like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible,
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:53.160]   not the Bible itself.
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:55.220]   And the same, not equating them,
[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:58.560]   but I haven't read Marx directly.
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:01.180]   I haven't read "Mein Kampf" by Hitler directly.
[02:51:01.180 --> 02:51:02.380]   And it feels like sometimes,
[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:06.660]   'cause you think it's better to read stuff about the books,
[02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:08.360]   but ultimately, you won't,
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.460]   because the analysis will be better
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:13.960]   in the texts that followed it.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:18.960]   But there's value to actually reading the actual words.
[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:22.880]   Yeah, there's this power in the words
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:25.920]   that there's a reason why the Bible
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:28.700]   is one of the most impactful books ever.
[02:51:28.700 --> 02:51:32.120]   It's in those words,
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:34.960]   and it's of value to return to those words.
[02:51:34.960 --> 02:51:36.920]   - The Communist Manifesto is truly frightening
[02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:40.340]   if you read it in modern context.
[02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:42.800]   - It's worth reading.
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:44.080]   - Yeah. - Worth reading.
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:46.240]   So is "Mein Kampf" not obviously,
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:48.000]   well, it's not obvious,
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.720]   but it is not very well written.
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:53.560]   But all the ideas that led to the evil that is Hitler
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:54.640]   are all in there,
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:57.620]   which is fascinating to think about,
[02:51:57.620 --> 02:51:59.920]   because probably some of the world leaders at the time
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:01.020]   should have probably read the books.
[02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:02.880]   He outlined everything he's gonna do.
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:06.820]   You've mentioned, offline,
[02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:08.580]   you mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.
[02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:12.440]   So let's try to end on this powerful quote.
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:13.360]   - "It's easy in the world
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:14.940]   "to live after the world's opinion.
[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.320]   "It's easy in solitude to live after your own.
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:19.560]   "The great man is who, in the midst of the world,
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:20.760]   "keeps with perfect sweetness
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:22.580]   "the independence of solitude."
[02:52:22.580 --> 02:52:26.440]   - What does this quote mean to you?
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:29.920]   - It's kind of reinforces the idea
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:33.200]   that you're here to live your life,
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:36.520]   and that even when people are trying to
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:43.640]   influence you or comment on the decisions
[02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:44.780]   that you make for your life,
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:47.000]   you should have the strength to stick by
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.440]   living your life the way you want to live it.
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:53.440]   That there's one immutable truth for you,
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:55.320]   and it doesn't apply to everyone.
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:56.820]   And so people who,
[02:52:56.820 --> 02:53:02.820]   people who frown upon
[02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:06.420]   or judge the way that you live,
[02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:10.140]   because it's not, air quotes, conventional,
[02:53:10.140 --> 02:53:13.560]   their opinion should not be something that
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:17.080]   impacts the choices that you make.
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:18.600]   - You're in a relationship now.
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:20.600]   - Yes. - Is that deeply meaningful?
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:23.080]   Or are you ultimately still alone?
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:24.880]   Are you still just a man in the cold
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:27.480]   of the life that is suffering?
[02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:29.320]   - No, I'm a man who's warm,
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.460]   nustled in a bosom.
[02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:34.840]   - I don't think there's a better way to end, John.
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:37.360]   (John laughs)
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:39.240]   You're a friend, you're my coach.
[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:41.440]   I'm sure we'll talk many more times in the future.
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.600]   Thanks for wasting all your time with me today.
[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:45.440]   - Thanks, brother.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:46.260]   - Thanks, Lex.
[02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:47.100]   I had an awesome time.
[02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:47.920]   Hope to be back soon.
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:51.320]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Clark.

[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:55.040]   Theragun, the device I use
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:57.200]   for post-workout muscle recovery.
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:54:00.040]   Magic Spoon, low-carb, keto-friendly cereal
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:01.840]   that I think is delicious.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:04.740]   8sleep, a mattress that cools itself
[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:07.720]   and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.
[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:09.260]   And finally, Cash App,
[02:54:09.260 --> 02:54:11.740]   the app I use to send money to friends.

[02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:32.240]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:36.740]   Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
