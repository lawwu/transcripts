[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.240]   open a Roth IRA or fund a traditional IRA, have you ever heard or proffered this argument?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.240]   Well, you'll pay less tax with the Roth IRA, so you should do that. Ever heard that one? Or worse,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.360]   ever made that one? It's myth-busting day on Radical Personal Finance, and today we're just
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   going to tackle this simple little question with a calculator. Welcome to the Radical
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.440]   Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host. Thank you for being
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.720]   here with me today as we work on building a rich life now and a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:34.640]   in 10 years or less. Going to keep today's show tightly focused on this myth. I'm ashamed to say
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:49.120]   that I used to spread this one. This is one of those common, common themes. There's a constant
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.600]   debate about Roth IRA versus traditional IRA. Roth IRA versus traditional IRA goes around
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   and around and around and around, and rightly so because it is a big decision. Now, to put it in
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.400]   perspective, recognize that it's really not that big of a decision for many people. You're capped
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   at, what, five grand-ish, depending on what year you're listening to this for your contributions
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   to a Roth IRA. So for some people, that can be a substantial portion of your income, but for many
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.640]   people, it's just not that much. But let's wade into it a little bit, and I want to keep tightly
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.040]   focused on one issue, which is simply the issue of the math. So if you are not familiar with the
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.560]   basic taxation of a traditional IRA versus a Roth IRA, it works like this. In a traditional IRA,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   and it's the same also in a 401(k) or other types of accounts that have the same taxation,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.680]   we're just going to stay today with the term traditional IRA. In traditional IRA, you earn
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.000]   a dollar, and you're able to contribute that dollar to your account before you pay income tax.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.200]   So if you earn a dollar, you get to put the whole thing in there, and you fund your account with a
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.280]   dollar. And then that money grows over time until it comes to the point of distribution,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.600]   at which you go ahead and pay your taxes. But now you pay taxes on the whole amount of the account
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   instead of just on the initial dollar. If you compare and contrast that to a Roth IRA,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.840]   a Roth IRA works like this. You earn a dollar, and you pay taxes on the dollar.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   Let's say that you're paying taxes at an effective tax rate of 30%. So 30 cents out of your dollar
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.200]   goes to the government. 70 cents gets contributed into the account. That 70 cents grows.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.560]   When you go to retire and are planning to make your distribution from the account,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.520]   at that point in time, you get to spend all of the money without paying income taxes on it.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   So whatever the balance of the account is at retirement age,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.120]   you can spend all of that money with no taxes due. So in which of those scenarios
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.480]   do you spend less money on tax? Most people intuitively would say the Roth IRA.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.600]   And I've probably baited you sufficiently that you were slow to answer in your mind,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.560]   but I used to say the Roth IRA. And by the way, to my own shame, I used to say the Roth IRA
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.720]   after I was a professional licensed financial advisor, giving financial advice. I had never
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   sat down and done this math. And then one day I sat down in my managing director's office,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.880]   and we were talking about this question. He's like, "You do know that they're exactly the same?"
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   I said, "No." He said, "Yes, they're exactly the same." And we did some math, and I tell you,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   I felt like a fool because here I was supposed to know what I'm talking about. And here I am
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.520]   perpetuating this myth on unsuspecting people. Thankfully, I didn't perpetuate it on too many
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.600]   people, but I did. So let's do a little bit of math, and let's keep it simple, because I think
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.120]   this is important to recognize. A lot of people get bogged down with the tax question when they
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.280]   are focusing on this, and they need to be looking at other factors, which is going to be where we'll
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.000]   go after I demonstrate this math to you. Let's do Roth math first. Bump it up from a dollar.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.440]   Bump it up from a dollar. Let's say that you earn $10,000, and between a dual-income household,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   you can contribute $10,000 to a couple of Roth IRAs. Assume that you are at a 25%
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.400]   effective tax bracket. This will help us keep math nice and simple. 25% effective tax bracket.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:57.600]   That means that you earn $10,000, and you pay $2,500 in taxes, leaving you with $7,500
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.480]   to invest in the account. Assume that you keep that money invested for a total of 10 years. I'm
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.120]   going to use nice round numbers, not making any statements about what you invest in, just using
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.480]   some round numbers to illustrate the point. So you invest the money for 10 years, and assume that
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:22.960]   your annual rate of return after taxes and expenses is 10%. Again, round numbers to illustrate a point.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.120]   At the end of your 10 years of investing, that $10,000 would have grown to be $19,453.07.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:41.040]   So that means because you invested using a Roth IRA, you can spend $19,453.07.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.280]   You paid your taxes up front. Again, if you're listening in the car, I'll repeat the numbers.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.800]   You earn $10,000. You are in a 25% effective tax bracket. You pay $2,500 in taxes, allowing you to
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.400]   invest $7,500 in the account. $7,500 invested today in one lump sum at a 10% annual rate of
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.280]   return for 10 years would come out to be $19,453.07 at the end of the term. We're assuming that
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.800]   you can distribute the money after your age of retirement, 59 and a half. We're assuming no
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.640]   penalties here in either scenario. We're also assuming that you're in the same tax bracket,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.880]   25%. That means that you can spend $19,453.07 at retirement.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   Now, let's compare that to a traditional IRA. In a traditional IRA, you're able to earn $10,000,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:45.200]   but you invest all of it before paying any income tax. That means that you have the full $10,000
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.320]   available as an investment. Invest that money in a lump sum at a 10% annual rate of return,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:08:00.560]   net of taxes and fees, for 10 years, and you wind up with $25,937.42 at the end of the term.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:09.360]   Much more. But remember now, you have that embedded tax liability. You have to pay 25%
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:17.920]   of that in taxes, which leaves you with $19,453.07 to spend in retirement.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:27.680]   Exactly the same number as the Roth. This is very important because many people begin their
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.720]   analysis of what to do, which type of account to use, with the mistaken assumption that the
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.120]   taxation is going to be different simply because they chose a Roth versus a traditional IRA.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   If you are in the same tax bracket during your working lifetime,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.200]   and if tax rates are the same during your working lifetime as they are after retirement,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   you will pay the identical amount percentage-wise of income tax.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.960]   Now, are there other extenuating factors? Yes, there are tons of them, tons of assumptions. So,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   for example, in the beginning of the show, I said, "You're going to pay the same amount of tax." Well,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.720]   you'll pay the same amount of tax when expressed as a percentage, but you will not pay the same
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.640]   amount of tax when expressed as a dollar value. In the first example, you pay $2,500 of tax,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:28.880]   and in the second example, if I can do the math real quick, $25,937.42 and pull out $19,453.07.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:36.640]   In the second time, you'll pay $6,484.35 of total tax. So, your total tax that you're paying
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.440]   will be very different, but the amount of your tax, excuse me, the percentage amount of your
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.600]   tax will be identical if your tax rate and tax bracket rates are the same.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:59.840]   So, when making this analysis, you cannot make the analysis simply on the basis of which is cheaper,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.960]   because they have the same net cost. You must make the analysis based upon other factors,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   and there are three major ones, and the third one is kind of a catch-all, so forgive me,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   but I just put them into three major ones. Number one, you have to make a judgment or a guess
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   about tax rates in general, tax brackets, generalized tax brackets for the population.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.880]   Do you expect tax brackets to be higher, to be lower? Do you expect tax brackets to be progressive,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:42.000]   increasing, or flat? Do you expect tax brackets to change or to stay consistent? So, you've got
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.920]   to make a guess about tax brackets in general and tax rates for the general population.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.360]   You also have to make a guess regarding your specific tax rates.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:01.920]   So, do you anticipate earning more income in the early years or in the later years, because your
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   specific tax rate will be judged, will be based upon the income that you're earning. Are you going
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.880]   to be making more during your working lifetime or at the end in retirement? You have to guess at that.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:23.440]   And finally, you have to factor in my point, my factor number three is what I call other factors,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   meaning you have to factor in the other features of the type of account that you choose. Simple
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.760]   example, in a Roth IRA, you can make a distribution of your contributions to the account at any time
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.680]   with no penalties or taxes due. So, if you contribute $5,000 to the account and next year
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.600]   you need $5,000, you can take the $5,000 right out. So, that's a little bit more flexible.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.080]   And the reason you can do it is because you've already paid the money on the tax. You can't
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.960]   touch the earnings without penalties, but you can touch the contributions.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.360]   Another factor might be something like a required minimum distribution.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.520]   A Roth IRA under current tax law does not have a required minimum distribution.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.160]   A traditional IRA would. Other types of accounts would. You also have to make decisions based upon
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.280]   your total income. Some people are eligible for IRAs that are deductible. Some people are eligible
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.360]   for Roth IRAs. Some people aren't. So, you've got to use those specific examples, and that's why we
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.320]   go into so much detail about these types of accounts. But to start with, you have to recognize
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.040]   that the math on them is exactly the same. Now, am I going to tell you what to do? Not really.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.600]   I'll tell you, the arguments you'll hear on all these different factors are many, and I think
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.760]   there are some good ones. The standard question that you hear today is, "Well, which direction do
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.560]   you think tax rates are going to go?" And the expected response, usually it's treated as a
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.200]   rhetorical question, the expected response is, "Well, they're going to go up because we have
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.600]   all this government debt." I tell you, I can see that argument. Personally, I'm not persuaded of
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.120]   it anymore. I'm not persuaded of it since reviewing the charts demonstrating that
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.920]   effective tax rates in general are actually pretty consistent over the last 70 years.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.480]   They really don't ever exceed 20% of GDP. So, I think that although there's a lot of political
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.920]   rhetoric around the increase of tax brackets, I don't think there's any political ability of
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.520]   somebody to actually affect it. If you look at the changing tax rates, even by those who want to
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.800]   increase taxes, in the aggregate, they're pretty minimal. So, I don't know that I particularly buy
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.320]   the argument about tax brackets changing in general, but I see the point. I don't know.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.240]   Your guess is as good as mine on that. How is it possible to make a political calculation about the
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.240]   political will of a large body of hundreds of millions of people who all have diverse interests,
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:03.200]   perspectives, and desires? I don't know. Your specific tax rates, that's a little bit more
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:12.800]   predictable, but it's very subjective to your plan. It's very subjective to your approach to life.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.960]   Most people will be earning much more during the working lifetime than in the retirement years.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.360]   That's what the data that I've reviewed indicates to me. That's why you'll find
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.960]   many financial advisors will usually recommend that it's better for you to do a deductible
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.720]   upfront option, because it's tough to accumulate enough money where your retirement income is
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:47.280]   going to be so high that you are going to be in a higher bracket in retirement. It's tough.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.160]   Is it possible? I don't know. I've tried to run some scenarios. I've never been satisfied with
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.080]   them enough to publish them. But of course, it's possible if you have excellent investments and
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.880]   you just become wealthier and wealthier every year. But if you just consider the mainstream
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   median scenario, middle-class, median income earners who are working, if you think about it,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.200]   many times a family is working hardest in their young years, lots of expenses involving kids,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   lots of expenses involving large mortgages. Most people are at the highest earnings in those early
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   years. Most people don't earn more in retirement than they do in working. So most people,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.720]   their personal tax rates are going to go down. But is that specific for you? I don't know.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.440]   You have to check that one out. I just make you aware that that's going to be the biggest factor.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:45.040]   And there's no perfect answer in the aggregate. It's all subjective. And at some point in time,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.160]   you're going to have to make a guess. What about those other factors? As far as I'm concerned,
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:57.440]   those other factors are compelling. And what I think is most reasonable is to make an assessment
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:05.040]   on an ongoing basis of which type of account you should use. It shouldn't be a standard decision
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.480]   of you always do this. It should be looking at my situation, my effective tax rate currently,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.920]   my prognosis for income changes in the coming years, the usefulness of these assets,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.880]   where do I want the money, do I want to have control of the money, etc. That's where all
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   the other shows we do and will do in the future, which dig into these questions, is very, very
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.680]   important. But today, I just want to leave you with that very simple math regarding the impact
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:42.240]   of tax brackets. For some of you, that may seem old hat, but I guarantee for some of you,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.960]   that's the first time you ever had that math done. I know it because that happened to me.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.160]   A lot of you like to catch out your financial advisors. That's a fun one to do. I'll bet you
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.640]   some percentage. I wouldn't say a majority, but I'll bet you some percentage of you,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.440]   if you want to have a little fun with your financial advisor, you might be able to catch
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.760]   them out in a moment of weakness and see if they've ever sat down and done that. You would
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.280]   have been able to catch me out in the past. So I recommend that to you.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.440]   This show came about as a response from an interesting email from a listener of a scenario
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.600]   that I'd never thought of for early retirement. I'm just going to leave it there with a teaser,
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.760]   but I've just spent the last hour and a half working on some interesting math of using
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.720]   traditional IRAs and 401ks for early retirement planning, taking income off of it, even when
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.800]   incurring the penalty. It's got some interesting results. So I'm still fact-checking it and working
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.840]   on it, but I'll share that with you in the future. I might have that listener on who brought me the
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.360]   idea. It was brand new to me. I just say that in closing to say, if any of you guys ever have these
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.760]   ideas, I'd love to hear from you. One of the greatest things, the benefits that I get doing
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.400]   this show is I get the benefit of interacting with you guys. I get the benefit of hearing from
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.160]   the collective intelligence. Many of you are so much more knowledgeable than I am. If you ever
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.800]   catch me in mistakes or you just have great ideas and you wonder if I've heard about them, please
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   send them to me. You can always do that, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com or just use the
