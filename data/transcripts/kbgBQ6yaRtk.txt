[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime author and pastor
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.880]   John Piper.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.040]   Today's question comes from a listener named Morgan.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.800]   "Dear Pastor John, it seems to me that some churches are more solemn when they celebrate
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.440]   the Lord's Supper.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.080]   Other churches seem to be more cheerful in the reminder of what Jesus has done for us.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.160]   Is this a false dichotomy?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   What is the proper tone of the Lord's table, solemn or cheerful?"
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.600]   I think the main thing I want to say is that it is not a decision for children to make.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.480]   It's not a decision for immature people with little experience of suffering and sorrow
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.240]   and sustaining grace to make.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.200]   This is a decision.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.360]   How to do the Lord's Supper.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.600]   It's a decision for battle proven, scarred, rugged warriors of the faith who have come
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.120]   through much suffering with eyes bright and lips smiling and hearts full of joyful hope
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.120]   and tears running down their faces.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.600]   They're the ones who would know how to design a service for every level of Christian.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.920]   Children and immature people with little life experience don't have the kind of complex
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.160]   emotional categories that are necessary to create the kind of atmosphere that reflects
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.040]   the realities of the Lord's Supper.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.560]   Children are either bouncing off the walls happy or they're moody or angry or sullen
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.640]   or crying.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.480]   Children have never experienced a kind of sorrow in which they wept for two hours while
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   rejoicing from the bottom of their heart like I did when my mother died 43 years ago.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.360]   Children don't have the experience of being shamed for the name of Christ and feeling
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   the white hot hatred of others pouring over their faces because of Christ and yet all
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.760]   the while rejoicing like the apostles in Acts 5 41 because they had been counted worthy
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.200]   to be shamed for the name.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.360]   That's just too complex of a set of emotions for children and immature Christians.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.520]   Children don't have the experience of tasting imminent danger with all the trembling that
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   goes with it while knowing in the same moment a peace that passes all understanding down
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.240]   in the soul.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.160]   That's too complex for a child or an immature Christian.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.680]   Children and immature Christians don't have sufficient experience to make any sense existentially
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.040]   out of Psalm 2 verse 11, "Serve the Lord with fear, rejoice with trembling."
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.560]   That just doesn't make sense to the heart that hasn't gotten to know the depths of what
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.920]   it means to fear the Lord, the very Lord who cares for us and loves us and yet would be
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.440]   terrifying to have as our enemy.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.840]   Children and immature Christians don't have sufficient experience to make sense out of
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120]   Paul's phrase, "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing."
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   In other words, the immature heart thinks that sorrow and joy are alternatives.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.640]   The immature thinks that joy and sorrow are sequential in life.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.920]   Sometimes we're sorrowful, at other times we're joyful, but they don't have categories
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400]   for simultaneous sorrow and joy.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.440]   Only the battle-scarred, broken-hearted, contrite, seasoned followers of Jesus know
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.840]   deep down in the fiber of their being that in this life they will never only rejoice
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.220]   and never only sorrow.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.800]   They will always be intermingled.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.900]   And children and immature Christians don't have sufficient experience to understand why
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.380]   Paul would say in Philippians 2.12 that precisely because God is at work in us willing and doing
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.040]   his good pleasure, we should fear and tremble.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.800]   Do our obedience with fear and trembling.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.840]   Wouldn't the presence of God working in us take away fear and trembling?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.000]   No, not all of it, but it takes a good bit of serious living with Jesus to discover these
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   things.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   I say all of that because the question as posed cannot be answered, "Should the Lord's
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   Supper be solemn or cheerful?"
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   And I'm saying it should not be either/or and should not be both sequentially.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:59.720]   There is a solemnity with explosive joy, and there is sweet cheerfulness whose eyes are
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.520]   brimming with tears.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.160]   The Lord's Supper is a commemoration and an emblematic demonstration of the most painful,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.880]   the most sinful, the most sorrowful act in the history of the world.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.520]   And it is aiming to produce in us a kind of joy in the gospel and in Christ that is greater
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.900]   than any joy in the world.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.040]   But that joy is not chipper, it's not glib, it's not superficial, it's not silly, it's
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.360]   not bouncy.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.840]   But the only people I expect to understand what I'm saying here are mature, seasoned,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:50.020]   battle-scarred veterans of some or much trial and suffering in which they have found Jesus
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.900]   to be all-sufficient and gloriously satisfying.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.480]   But even though that's the only person I expect to get what I'm saying, I might be able to
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   give a hint that would help people.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.560]   Several years ago, one of the young men of our church died suddenly with no apparent
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   explanation.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   He was in his 20s.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.720]   He was a strong believer.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   In fact, he had died in the midst of a beautiful ministry.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.940]   So his parents and family were grieving, but not as those who had no hope.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.920]   We were all keenly aware that our brother was indescribably happy with Jesus while we
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.760]   were pouring out our sorrows.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:45.160]   When we gathered for the funeral, the church was packed and it had been arranged by the
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:57.100]   parents that we would be singing as a congregation, as the family and the body entered, singing
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:07.660]   a mighty song, a big, strong, triumphant song of victory over death and celebration of life.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.560]   And even as I recall it now, several years later, shivers are going down the backs of
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:23.460]   my arms because as I told his father later, that moment, that moment was one of the greatest
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.500]   moments of my life.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.380]   Great with joy, great with sorrow.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:40.320]   When I looked down from the platform and saw this father with his hands in the air, I could
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.360]   scarcely contain the power of what I felt.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:59.200]   And I don't know what to call it except exquisitely joyful sorrow and exquisitely sorrowful joy.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.700]   So that's my answer.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:12.120]   The Lord's Supper is in a class by itself in combining emotions that only the veterans
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.260]   of sorrow and joy understand well enough to plan the service appropriately.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.060]   And that's my prayer and that's my goal is that such people would plan the service.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.060]   Yes.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.060]   Amen.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.320]   That was a powerful and unforgettable moment for a very remarkable family and a young man
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   who was truly missed.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   What a testimony.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.700]   And thank you for listening and making this podcast part of your day and your commute
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.500]   and part of your daily routine.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.420]   Three times a week, we publish this podcast and you can subscribe to our audio feeds and
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.760]   keep up with new episodes and search our past episodes in the archive and even reach us
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.220]   by email with a question you may be facing in life.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.940]   You can do all that through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.980]   We are going to return on Wednesday and I think we're going to hear from a listener
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.540]   who finds reading to be excruciatingly hard.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.800]   And this is due to a learning disability that he is faced with.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.840]   But he wants to study big swaths of scripture over time and he wants help for how to do
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.100]   this well, even if it's done through little bits over time.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.860]   What's a good cumulative strategy for reading the Bible when reading is so difficult?
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.860]   That's the question on Wednesday.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
